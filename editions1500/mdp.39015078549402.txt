PREFACE.
H E Success the former Part of
this Work has met with in the
Worlds has yet been no other\ than
is acknowledged to be due to the sur-
prising Variety of the Subje£f> and
to the agreeable Manner of the Performance.
ALL the Endeavours of envious People to
reproach it with being a Romance, to search it
for Errors in Geography, Inconsistency in the
Relation, and Contradictions in the Faff, have
proved abortive, and as impotent as malicious.
T H E just Application of every Incident, the
religious and useful Inferences drawn from every
Part, <ire so many Testimonies to the good De-
sign of ?naking it public, and must legitimate all
the Part that may be calFd Invention or Para-
ble in the Story-.
THE Second Part, if the Editor's Opinion
may pass, is (contrary to the Usage of Second
Parts) every way as entertaining as the First;
contains as strange and surprising Incidents, and
A 2 41S
 
as , a great a Variety of them; nor is the Appfi^
cation less serious of suitable; and doubtless
will, to the sober, as well as ingenious Reader*
be every way as profitable and diverting and
this makes the abridging this Work as scan-
dalous, as it is knavish and ridiculous % feeing,
to shorten the Book, that they may seem to reduce
the Value, they strip it os all those Reflections, as
well religious as moral, which are not only the
greatest Beauties of the Work, hut are calcu-
lated for the infinite Advantage of the Re a d e r.
BT this, they leave the Work naked of its
brightest Ornaments % and yet they would (at
the fame time they pretend that the Author has
supply* d the Story out of his Invention) take
from it the Improvement,, which alone recom-
mends that Invention to wife and good Men.
THE Injury these Men do to the Pro-
prietors of W o r k s, is a Pra£tice all hottest
Men abhor ; and they believe they may challenge
them to fliew the Difference between that and
JRobbing on the Highway, or breaking open a
House.
I F they can't shew any Difference in the
Crime, they will find it hard to shew why
there-should be any Difference in the Punishment,

ADVENTURES
O F
Robinson Crusoe, &c.
HAT homely Proverb used on so many
Occasions in Englandy viz. 7bat (what
is bred hi the Bone "ivill not go out of
the Flejby was never more verify'd than
in the Story of my LIFE. Any one
would think, that after thirty-five Years
Affliction, and a Variety of unhappy Circumstances,
which few Men, if any ever, went thro* before, and
after near seven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the
Fulness of all Things; grown old, and when, if &very
it might be allowed me to have had Experience of every
State of middle Life, and to know which was most
adapted to make a Man completely happy; I fay, after
all this, any one would have thought, that the native
Propensity to Rambling, which I gave an Account of
in my first setting out into the World, to have been so*
predominant in my Thoughts, should be worn out, the*
volatile Part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed,
and I might at 61 Years of Age have been a little inclhVd
to stay at Home, and have done venturing Life and For-
tune any more.
Nay, farther, the common Motive of foreign Adven-
tures was taken away in me ; for I had no Fortune to
make, I had nothing to seek ; If I had gain'd ten thou-
sand
 
6 she Li f e and Adventures of
and Pounds, I had been no richer; for I had already
sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to;
and that I had, was visibly increasing; for having no
great Family, I could not spend the Income of what
I had, unless I would set up for an expensive Way of
Living, such as a great Family, Servants, Equipage,
Gaiety, and the /ike, which were Things I had no No-
tion of, or Inclination to; so that I had nothing indeed
to do, but to sit still, and sully enjoy what I had got,
and see it increase daily upon my Hands.
Yet all these Things had no Effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong Inclination I had
to go abroad again, which hung about me like a chro-
nical Distemper; particularly the Desire of seeing my
new Plantation in the Island, and the Colony I left
there, run in my Head continually. I dreamM of it all
Night, and my Imagination ran upon it all Day; it
was uppermost in all my Thoughts, and my Fancy
work'd so steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked of
it in my Sleep; in sliort, nothing could remove it out
of my Mind: It even broke so violently into all my
Discourses, that it made my Conversation tiresome;
for I could talk of nothing else; all my Discourse run
into it, even to Impertinence j and I saw it myself.
I have oficn heard Persons of good Judgment fay,
that all the Stir People make in the World about Ghosts
and Apparitions, is owing to the Strength of Imagina-
tion, and the powerful Operation of Fancy in their
Minds; that there is no such thing as a Spirit appearing,
err a Ghost walking, and the like: That people's poring
affectionately upon the past Conversation of their deceas'd
Friends, fa realizes it to them, that they are capable of
fanfying upon some extraordinary Circumstances, that
they fee them, talk to them, and are answer'd by them;
when, in Truth, there is nothing but Shadow and Vapour
in the Thing, and they really know nothing of the Matter.
For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whether
there are any such Things as real Apparitions, Spectres,
or Walking of People after they are dead, or whether
there is any thing in the Stories they tell us of that Kind,
more than the Product of Vapours, sick Minds, and
wandering Fancies : But this I know, that my Imagina-
"tion
don work'd up to such a Height, and brought me into
such Excess of Vapours, or what else I may call it,
that I actually supposed myself oftentimes upon the
Spot, at my old Castle behind the Trees; saw my old
Spaniard Fridays Father, and the reprobate Sailors,
whom I left upon the Island: Nay, I fansy'd I talk'd
with them, and look'd at them so steadily, tho* I was
broad awake, as at Persons just before me; and this I
did, till I often frighted myself with the Images my
Fancy represented to me. One Time in my Sleep I
had the Viilany of the three Pirate Sailors so lively re-
lated to me, by the first Spaniard, and Friday s Father,
that it was surprising; they told me how they barba-
rously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that
they set Fire to the Provisions they had laid up, on pur-
pose to distress and starve them; Things that I had
never heard of, and that yet were all of them true in,
Fact: And it was so warm in my Imagination, and so
realizM to me, that to the Hour I saw them, I could
not be persuaded, but that it was, or would be true;
alto how I resented it, when the Spaniards complained to
me; and how I brought them to Justice, try'd them be-
fore me, and ordered them all three to be hang'd:
What there was really in this, (hall be seen in its Place:
For however I came to form such Things in my Dream*
and what secret Converse of Spirits injected it, yet
there was, / fay, very much of it true. I own, that
this Dream had nothing in it literally and specifically true;
but the general Part was so true, the base and villanous
Behaviour of these three hardened Rogues was such, and
had been so much worse than all I can describe, that the
Dream had too much Similitude of the Fact; and as I
would afterwards have punished them severely, so if I
had hang'd them all, I had been much in the Right, and
should have been justified both by the Laws of God and
Man.
But to return to my Story: In this kind of Tem-
per I had livM some Years; I had no Enjoyment
of my Life, no pleasant Hours, no agreeable Diversion,
but what had something or other of this in it; ib that
my Wife, who saw my Mind so wholly bent upon it,
told me very seriously one Night, that (he believ'd
there was some secret powerful Impulse of Providence
5 upon
«pon me, which had determin'd me to go thither again t
and that she found nothing hindered my going, but my
being engag'd to a Wife and Children. She told me,
that it was true, (he could not think of parting with
me; but as she was assured, that if she was dead, it
would be the first Thing I would do; so, as it feem'd
to her, that the Thing was determin'd above, ihe
would not be the only Obstruction: For if I thought
fit, and resolvM to go Here she found me very
intent upon her Words, and that I look'd very earnest-
ly at her; so that it a little disordered her, and ihe
stopt. I asked her why she did not go on, and say
out what she was going to fay. But I perceiv'd her
Heart was too full, and some Tears stood in her Eyes:
Speak out, my Dear, said I: Are you willing I should
go. No, says Jke9 very affeftionately, I am far from
willing: But if you are, resolved to go, says she, ra-
ther than I will be the only Hindrance, I will go
with you; for tho' I think it a preposterous 'Thing for
one of your Years, and in your Condition, yet if it
must be, said she again, weeping, I won't leave you; for
if it be of Heaven, you must do it, there is no resist-
ing it; and if Heaven makes it your Duty to go, he
will also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dis-
pose of me, that I may obstruct it.
This affectionate Behaviour of my Wife's brought me
a little out of the Vapours, and I began to consider what
I was a doing: I corrected my wandring Fancy, and
began to argue with myself sedately, what Business I
Iiad, after threescore Years, and after such a Life of te-
dious Sufferings and Disasters, and closed in so happy
and easy a Manner, I say, what Business had I to rush
into new Hazards, and put myself upon Adventures*
lit only for Youth and Poverty to run into?
With those Thoughts, I considered my new Engage-
ments, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wife
then great with Child of another; that I had all the
World could give me, and had no need to seek Hazards
for Gain ; that I was declining in Years, and ought to
think rather of leaving what I had gain'd, than of seek-
ing to increase \t; that as to what my Wife had said, of
its being an Impulse from Heaven, and that it should
be my Duty to go, I had no Nouon of that; fb after
many
many of these Cogitations, I struggled with the Power
of my Imagination reasoned myself out of it, as I be-
lieve People may always do in like Cafes, if they will; and,
in a word, I conquered it; composed myself with such
Arguments as occurred to my Thoughts, and which my
present Condition furnisiVd me plentifully with; and par-
ticularly, as the most effectual Method, I resolv'd to di-
vert myself with other Things, and to engage in some
Business that might effectually tie me up from any more
Excursions of this Kind; for I found the Thing returned
upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or
any thing of Moment immediately before me.
To this Purpose I bought a little Farm in the County
of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had
a little convenient House upon it, and the Land about it
I sound was capable of great Improvement, and that it
was many ways suited to my Inclination, which delighted
in Cultivating, Managing, Planting, and Improving of
Land; and particularly, being an Inland Country, I was
removed from conversing among Ships, Sailors, and
Things relating to the remote Parts of the World.
In a word, I went down to my Farm, settled my
Family, bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Wag-
gon, Horses, Cows, Sheep; and, setting seriously to
work, became in one Half-year, a mere Country Gentle-
man; my Thoughts were intirely taken up in manage-
iRg my Servants, cultivating the Ground, Inclosing,
Planting, &c and I liv'd, as I thought, the moll
agreeable Life that Nature was capable of directing, or
that a Man always bred to Misfortunes was capable of
heing retreated to.
I farm'd upon my own Land, I had no Rent to pay,
was limited by no Articles; I could pull up, or cut
down, as I pleased: What I planted was for myself;
and what I improved was for my Family; and having
thus left off the Thoughts of Wandering, J had not
the least Discomfort in any Part of my Life, as to this
World. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoy'd that
middle State of Life, which my Father so earnestly re-
commended to me: A kind of Heavenly Life/ some-
thing like what is described by the Poet upon the Sub-
ject of a Country Life.
Vol. II. B Free
Free from Vices, free from Care>
Age has no Pain, and Tout/? no Snare,
But in the Middle os all this Felicity, one Blow front
unseen Providence unhing'd me at once; and not only-
made a Breach upon me inevitable and incurable; but"
drove me by its Consequence, upon a deep Relapse into
the wandering Disposition, which, as I may fay, being
born in my very Blood, soon recovered its Hold of me,
and, like the Returns of a violent Distemper, came on
with an irresistible Force upon me; so that nothing
could make any more Impression upon me. This Blow
was the Loss of my Wife.
It is not my Business here to write an Elegy upon
my Wife, to give a Character of rier particular Virtues,
and make my Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a
Funeral Sermon. She was in a few Words, the Stay of
all my Affairs, the Centre of all my Enterprises; the
Engine, that by her Prudence reduced me to that hap-
py Compass I was in, from the most extravagant and
ruinous Project that flutter'd in my Head, as above;
and did more to guide my rambling Genius, than a Mo-
ther's Tears, a Father's Instructions, a Friend's Counsel,
or all my own reasoning Powers, could do. I was
happy in listening to her Tears, and in being mov'd by
&er Intreaties, and to the last Degree desolate and dis-
located in the World by the Loss of her.
When she was gone, the World look'd aukwardly
round me; I was as much a Stranger in it, in my
Thoughts, as I was in the Brœ/i/s, when I first went
on shore there; and as much alone, except as to the
Assistance of Servants, as I was in my Island. I knew
neither what to do, or what not to dp. I saw the
World busy round me, one Part labouring for Bread,
and the other squandering it in vile Excesses, or empty
Pleasures; equally miserable, because the End they pro-
posed still fled from them; for the Men of Pleasure
every Day surfeited os their Vice, and heaped up
Work for Sorrow and Repentances and the Men of
Labour spent their Strength in daily Smugglings for
Bread te maintain the vital Strength they labour'a
with j so living in a daily Circulation of Sorrow, living
but
but to Works and working but to live, as if daily
Bread were the only End of wearisome Life, and a
wearisome Life the only Occasion of daily Bread,
This put me in mind of the Life I lived in my King-
dom, the Island; where I suffered no more Corn to
grow, because I did not want it; and bred no more
Goats, because I had no more Use for them: Wher«
the Money lay in the Drawer till it grew mildew'd, and
had scarce the Favour to be looked upon in 20 Years.
All these Things, had I improved them as I ought
to have done, and as Reason and Religion had dictated
to me, would have taught me. to search further than
human Enjoyments for a full Felicity, and that there
was something which certainly was the Reason and End
of Life, superior to all these Things, which vvas either to
be poffess'd, or at least hoped for on this Side the Grave.'
But my sage Counsellor was gone; I was like a ,Ship,
without a Pilot, that could only run afore the Wind: My
Thoughts run all away again into the old Affair; my
Head was quite turned with the Whimsies of foreign
Adventures; and all the pleasing innocent Amusements
of my Farm, and my Garden, my Cattle and my Fa-
mily, which before intirely poslest me, were nothing
to me; had no Relim, and were like Music to one that
has no Ear, or Food to one that has no Taste: In a
word, I resolv'd to leave off Housekeeping, lett my
Farm, and return to London and in a few Months
after, I did so.
When I came to London^ I was still as uneasy as
before j I had no Relish to the Place, no Employment
in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle
Person, os whom it may be said, he is perfectly useless
in God's Creation, and it is not one Farthing Matter to
the rest of his Kind whether he be dead or alive. This
also was the Thing, which of all Circumstances of Life
was the most my Aversion, who had been all my Days
used to an active Life; and I would often say to myseif;
A State of Idleness is the very Dregs of Life; and indeed
I thought I was much more suitably employed, when
I was 26 Days a making me a Deal-board.
It was now the Beginning of the Year 1693. when
my Nephew, whom, as I have observed before- I had
B 2 brought
brought up to the Sea, and had made him Commander
of a Ship, was come Home from a short Voyage to
Bilboa, being the first he had made: He came to me,
and told me, that some Merchants of his Acquaintance
had been proposing to him to go a Voyage fof them to
the Eaf-Indies, and to China, as private Traders : And
*GiV) Uncle, fays he, if you wilt go to Sea with me> Til
tngage to land you upon your old Habitation in the lJJand9
for <ive are to touch at the Brafiss.
Nothing can be a greater Demonstration of a future
State, and of the Existence of an invisible World, than
the Concurrence of second Causes with the Ideas of
Things, which we form in our Minds, perfectly re-
ferv'd, and not communicated to any in the World.
My Nephew knew nothing how far my Distemper
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew no-
thing of what he had in his Thoughts to fay y when
that very Morning before he came to me, I had, in a
great deal of Confusion of Thought, and revolving
every Part of my Circumstances in my Mind, come to
this Resolution; <vi<sc. That I would go to Lisbon, and
consult with my old Sea-Captain; and so, if it was ra-
tional and practicable, I would go and fee the Island
again, and fee what was become of my People there:
I had pleased myself also with the Thoughts of .peo-
pling the Place, and carrying Inhabitants from hence,
getting a Patent for the Possession, and I know not
what; when, in the Middle of all this, in comes my
Nephew, as I have said, with his Project of carrying
me thither, in his Way to the Eaji-lndies.
I paus'd awhile at his Words, and looking steadily
at him, 'what Th'vil, said I, sent you of this unlucky Er-
rand? My Nephew startled, as if he had been frighted
at first; bat, perceiving I was not much displeased with
the Proposal, he recovered himself: I hope it may not
be an unlucky Proposal, Sir, fays he; I dare say you
would be pleasM to see your new Colony there, where
you once reigned with more Felicity, than most of you?
Brother Monarchs in the World.
In a word, the Scheme hit so exactly with my Tem-
per, that is to fay, with the Prepossession I was under,
and of which I have said so much, that I told him m
few Words, if he agreed with the Merchants, I would
go with him: But I told him, I would not promise to go
any farther than my own Island. Why Sir, says he, y$x
don't avant to ht lest there again, I hope? Why, said I,
can you not take me up again in your Return? He told
me, it would not be pollible to do so; that the Mer-
chants would never allow him to come that Way witk
a loaden Ship of such Value, it being a Month's fail out
of his Way, and might be three or four : Besides, Sir, if
1 Jbould miscarry, said he, and not return at all, tfon you
Would be just reduced to the Condition you <zvere in before*
This was very rational; but we both found out a
Remedy for it, which was to carry a framed Sloop oa
board the Ship, which, being taken in Pieces, and
fhipM on board the Ship, might, by the Help of some
Carpenters whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up
again in the Island, and sminVd, fit to go to Sea in a
sew Days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the Importuni-
ties of my Nephew joined in so effectually with my In-
clination, that nothing could oppose me: On the other
hand, my Wife being dead, I had nobody that concern-
ed themselves so much for me, as to i^rsuade me one
way or other, except my antient goods%riend the Wi-
dow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider
my Years, my easy Circumstances* and the needless
Hazard of a long Voyage; and, above all, my young
Children: But it was all to no Purpose, I had an ir-
resistible Desire to the Voyage; and I told her, I thought
there was something so uncommon in the Impressions
I had upon my Mind for the Voyage, that it would be
a kind of resisting Providence, if" I should attempt to
stay at Home; after which she ceas'd her Expostula-
tions, and join'd with me, not only in making Provision
for my Voyage, but also in settling my Family-Affair$
in my Absence, and providing for the Education of my
Children.
In order to this, I made my Will, and settled the
Estate I had in such a Manner for my Children, and
placed it in such Hands, that I was perfectly easy and
satisfy'd they would have Justice done them, whatever
might befal me; and for their Education, I left it
wholly to my Widow, with a sufficient Maintenance
to
to herself for her Care: All which ihe richly deserv'd;
for no Mother could have taken more Care in their
Education, or understood it better; and as she lived till
I came Home, I also liv'd to thank her for it.
My Nephew was ready to fail about the Beginning
of January, 1694-5, and I with my Man Friday went
on board, in the Downs, the 8th, having, besides that
Sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable
Cargo os all Kinds of necessary Things for my Colony,
which if I did not find in good Condition, I resolved to
leave so.
First, I carried with me some Servants, whom I
purposed to place there, as Inhabitants, or at least, to
set on Work there upon my own Account while I stay'd,
and either to leave them there, or cany them forward,
as they should appear willing; particularly, I carried
two Carpenters, a Smith, and a very handy ingenious
Fellow, who was a Cooper by Trade, but was nKo a
general Mechanic; for he was dextrous at making
Wheels, and Hand-mills to grind Corn; was a good
Turner, and a good Pot-maker; he also made any thing
that was proper to make of Earth, or Wood; in a
Word, we call'd him our Jack of all Trades.
With these I carry'd a Tayl >r, who had offered him-
self to go Passenger to the East-Indies ^ with my Ne-
phew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new
Plantation, and proved a most necessary handy Fellow,
as could be defir'd, in many other Businesses, besides
that of his Trade; for, as I observed formerly, Neces-
• sity arms us for all Employments.
My Cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not
kept an Account of Particulars, consisted of a sufficient
Quantity of Linen, and some thin English Stuffs for
•cloathing the Spaniards that I expected to find there;
and enough of them, as by my Calculation might com-
fortably supply them for seven Years.; if I remember
right, the Materials which I carry'd for cloathing them,
with Gloves, Hats, Shoes, Stockings, and all such
Things" as they could want for wearing, amounted to
above 200 Pounds, including some Beds, Bedding, and
Houstiold-stuff, particularly Kitchen-utensils, with Pots,
Kettles, Pewter, "Brass, &c besides near 100 Pounds
more in Iron-work, Nail-;, Tools of every Kind, Sta-
pies, Hooks, Hinges, and every necessary Thing I
could think of.
1 carried also a hundred spare Arms, Musquets and
Fusils, besides some Pistols, a considerable Quantity of
Shot of all Sizes, three or four Tons of Lead, and twfr
Pieces of Brass Canon j and because I knew not what
Time, and what Extremities, I was providing for, I
carry'd an hundred Barrels of Powder, besides Swords
aud Cutlasses, and the Iron Part of some Pikes, and
Halberts, so that, in short, we had a large Magazine of
all Sorts of Stores; and I made my Nephew carry two
small Quarter-deck Guns more than he wanted for his
Ship, to leave behind, if there was Occasion; that,
when they came there, we might build a Fort, and man
it against all Sorts of Enemies: And indeed I at first
thought there would be Need enough for it ail, and'
much more, if we hoped to maintain our Possession of
the Island, as shall be seen in the Course of the Story.
I had not such bad Luck in this Voyage, as I had
been used to meet with; and therefore sliall have the
less Occasion to interrupt the Reader, who perhaps
may be impatient to hear how Matters went with my
Colony; yet some odd Accidents, cross Winds, and
bad Weather happened, on this first setting out, which
made the Voyage longer than I expected it at first;
and I, who had never made but one Voyage, <vzz. my
firjl Voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to
come back again, as the Voyage was at first designed,"
began to think the fame ill Fate still attended me; and4
that I was born to be never contented with my own
Shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at Sea.
Contrary Winds first put us to the Northward, and
we were obliged to put in at Gakvay in Ireland, where
we lay Windbound two-and-thirty Days; but we
had this Satisfaction with the Disaster, that Provisions
were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost Plenty;
so that while we lay here, we never touched the Ship's
Stores, but rather added to them; here also I took se-
veral Hogs, aud two Cows with their Calves, which
I resolv'd, if I had a good Passage, to put a-fhore in
my Island, but we found Occasion to dispose otherwise
of them.
We
We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and
had a very fair Gale of Wind for some Days; as I re-
member, it might be about the 20th of February in the
Evening, late, when the Mate, having the Watch, came
into the Round- house, and told us, he saw a Flash of
Fire, and heard a Gun fired; and while he was telling
us of it, a Boy came in, and told us the Boatswain
heard another. This made us all run out upon the
Quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing;
but in a few Minutes we saw a very great Light, and
found that there was some very terrible Fire at a Di-
stance ; immediately we had recourse to our Reckon-
ings, in which we all agreed, that there could be no
Land that Way, in which the Fire (hewed itself, no>
not for 500 Leagues; for it appeared at W. N. W.
Upon this we concluded it must be some Ship on Fire
at Sea, and as by our hearing the Noise of Guns just
before, we concluded it could not be far off, we stood
directly towards it, and were presently satisfied we
should discover it, because the farther we sailed, the
greater the Light appeared, tho' the Weather being hazy,
we could not perceive any thing but the Light for a
while: In about half an Hour's Sailing, the Wind being
fair for us, tho' not much of it, and the Weather clear-
ing up a little, we could plainly disern, that it was a
great Ship on Fire in the Middle of the Sea. I was most
sensibly touched with this Disaster, though not at all
acquainted with the Persons engaged in it ; I presently
recollected my former Circumstances, in what Condi-
tion I was in, when taken up by the Portugal Captain;
and how much more deplorable the Circumstances of the
poor Creatures belonging to this Ship must be, if they
had no other Ship in Company with them: Upon this,
I immediately ordered, that five Guns should be fired,
one soon after another, that, if possible, we might give
Notice to them, that there was Help for them at hand,
and that they might endeavour to save themselves in their
Boat; for though we could fee the Flame in the Ship,
yet they, it being Night, could fee nothing of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the
burning Ship drove, waiting for Day-light; when on a
sudden, to Our great Terror, though we had Reason
tp expect it, the Ship blew up in the Air, and imme-
diately
diately, that is to fay, in a Few Minutes, all t£e fire*
was out, that is to fay, the rest of the Ship funk : This
was terrible, and indeed an afflicting Sight, for the fake
of the poor Men, who, I concluded, must be either, all
destroyed in the Ship, or be in the utmost Distress in v
their Boats in the Middle of the Ocean, which, at pre-
sent, by reason it was dark, I could not fee: However,
to direct them as well as I could, I caused Lights to be
hung out in all the Parts of the Ship where we could,
and which we had Lanthorns for, and kept firing Guns
all the Night long; letting them know by this, that
there was a Ship not far off.
About Eight o'Clock in the Morning, we discovered
the Ship's Boat's, by the Help of our Perspective-glasses;
and found there were two of them, both throng'd with
People, and deep in the Water: We perceived they
row'd, the Wind being against them; that they saw our
Ship, and did the utmost to make us fee them.
We immediately spread our Ancient, to let them
know we saw them; and hung a Waft out, as a Signal
for them to come on board; and then made more Sail,
standing directly to them. In a little more than half an
Hour, we came up with them, and, in a word, took them
all in, being no less than sixty-four, Men, Women, and
Children; for there were a great many Passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French Merchant-
ship of 300 Tons, homeward-bound from Quebeck) in
the River of Canada. The Master gave us a long Ac-
count of the Distress of his Ship, how the Fire began in
the Steerage, by the Negligence of the Steersman; but,
on his crying out for Help, was, as every body thought,
intirely put out: But they soon found, that some Sparks
Of the first Fire had gotten into some Part of the Ship,
so difficult to come at, that they could not effectually
quench it; and afterwards getting in between the Tim-
bers, and within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded
into the Hold, and mastered all the Skill, and all the
Application, they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then, but to get into their
Boats, which, to their great Comfort, were pretty large ^
being their Long-boat, and a great Shallop, besides a
small Skiff, which was of no great Service to" them,
other than to get some fresh Water and Provisions into s
Vol. IL C her,
her, after they had secured themselves from the Fire,
They had indeed small Hope of their Lives by getting
into these Boats at that Distance from any Land; only,
as they said well, that they were escaped from the Fire,
and had a Possibility, that some Ship might happen to
be at Sea, and might take them in. They had Sails,
Oars, and a Compass; and were preparing to make the
best of their Way to Newfoundland) the Wind blowing
pretty fair; for it blew an easy Gale at S. E. by E. They
lad as much Provisions and Water, as, with sparing it
so as to be next Door to starving, might support them
about 12 Days; in which, if they had no bad Weather,
and no contrary Winds, the Captain said, he hoped he
might get to the Banks of Newfoundland, and might per-
haps take some Fisli to sustain them till they might go
on shore. But there were so many Chances against
them in all these Cases ; such as Storms to overset and
founder them; Rains and Cold to benumb and perish
their Limbs; contrary Winds to keep them out, and
starve them; that it must have been next to miraculous,
if they had escaped.
In the midst of their Consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the Captain with Tears
in his Eyes told me, they were on a sudden surprised
with the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and after that four
more; these were the five Guns which I caused to be
fired at first seeing the Light: This revived their Hearts,
and gave them the Notice, which, as ab&ve, I defign'd
it should, <viz. that there was a Ship at hand for their
Help.
It was upon the hearing these Guns, that they took
down their Masts and Sails; and the Sound coming from
the Windward, they resolved to lie by till Morning.
Some time after this, hearing no more Guns, they fired
three Musquets, one a considerable while after another ^
but these, the Wind being contrary, we never heard.
Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our Lights, and hear-
ing the Guns, which, as I have said, I caused to
be fired all the rest of the Night; this set them to
work with their Oars to keep their Boats a-head, at
least that we might the sooner come up mtk them;
and at last, to their inexpressible Joy, they found we
saw them.
It is impossible for me to express the several Gestures,
the strange Ecstasies, the Variety of Postures, which
these poor delivered People run into, to express the Joy
of their Souls at so unexpected a Deliverance; Grief and
Fear are easily described; §ighs, Tears, Groans, and a
very few Motions of Head and Hands, make up the Sum
of its Variety: But an Excess of Joy, a Surprise of Joy,
has a thousand Extravagancies in it; there were some in
Tears; some raging and tearing themselves, as if they
had been in the greatest Agonies of Sorrow; some stark-
raving, and downright lunatic; some ran about the Ship
stamping with their Feet, others wringing their Hands;
some were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more
crying; many quite dumb, not able to speak a Word;
others sick and vomiting, several swooning, and ready to
faint; and a few were crossing themselves, and giving
God Thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterward; but the Passion was
too strong for them at first, and they were not able to
master it; they were thrown into Ecstasies, and a kind
of Frenzy, and so there were but a very few who were
composed and serious in their Joy.
Perhaps also the Cafe may have some Addition to it,'
from the particular Circumstance of the Nation they be-
longed to; I mean the French; whose Temper is al-
lowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and moic
sprightly, and their Spirits more fluid, than of other Na-
tions. I am not Philosopher enough to determine the
Cause, but nothing I had ever seen before came up to it t
The Ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty Savage, was in,
when he found his Father in the Boat, came the nearest
to it; and the Surprise of the Master, and his two Com-
panions, whom I delivered from the two Villains that
set them on shore in the Island, came a little way towards
it; but nothing was to compare to this, either that I fa\tf
in Friday, or any-where else in my Life.
It is farther observable, that these Extravagancies did
not (hew themselves in * that different Manner I hav$
mentioned, in different Persons only: But all the Va-
riety would appear in a short Succession of Moments,
C 2 jjX
in one and the same Person. A Man. that we saw thi*
Minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and confounded,
should the next Minute be dancing and hallooing like
an Antick ; and the next Moment a tearing his Hair, or
pulling his Cloaths to pieces, and stamping them under
his Feet, like a Madman; a few Minutes afeer that, we
should have him all in Tears, then sick, then swooning;
and had not immediate Help been had, would, in a
few Moments more, have been dead; and thus it was,
not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the
greatest Fart of them; and, if I remember right, our
Surgeon was obliged to let above thirty of them Blood.
There were two Priests among them, one an old Man,
and the other a young Man; and that which was strangest
was, that the oldest Man was the worst.
As soon as he set his Foot on board our Ship, and
saw himself safe, he dropped down stone-dead, to all
Appearance; not the least Sign .of Life could be per-
ceived in him; our Surgeon immediately applied proper
Remedies to recover him, and was the only Man in the
Ship that believed he was not dead: And at length he
opened a Vein in his Arm, having first chaf'd and rub-
bed the Part, so as to warm it as much as possible: Upon
this the Biood, which only dropped at first, flowed
something freely; in three Minutes after the Man open'd
his Eyes; and about a Quarter of an Hour after that, he
spoke, grew better, and in a little Time quite well;
after the Blood was stopped, he walked about, told us
he was perfectly well, took a Dram of Cordial which
ihe Surgeon gave him, and was what we called, come
to himself; about a Quarter of an Hour after this, they
came running into the Cabin to the Surgeon, who was
bleeding a French Woman that had fainted; and told
him, the Priest was gone stark-mad; it seems he had
began to revolve the Change of his Circumstances in
his Mind, and this put him into an Ecstasy of Joy; his
Spirits whirPd about faster than the Vessels could convey
them; the Blood grew hot and feverish; and the Man
was at fit for Bedlam, as any Creature that ever was in
jt: The Surgeon would not bleed him again in that
Condition, but gave him something to doze and put
kirn to steep, which, after some time, operated upon
him, and he waked next Morning perfectly composed,
and well.
The younger Priest behaved himself with great Com-
mand of his Passion, and was really an Example of a
serious well-governed Mind; at his first coming on board
"the Ship, he threw himself flat on his Face, prostrating
himself in Thankfulness for his Deliverance; in which I
unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking
he had been in a Swoon; but he spake calmly; thanked
me; told me, he was giving God Thanks for his Delive-r
ranee; begged me to leave him a few Moments, and
that, next to his Maker, he would give me Thanks also,
I was heartily sorry, that I disturbed him; and not
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him
also 5 he continued in that Posture about three Minutes,
or a little more, after I left him; then came to me, as
he had said he would; and with a great deal of Serious-
ness and Affection, but with Tears in his Eyes, thanked
me, that had, under God, given him, and so many
miserable Creatures, their Lives: I told him, I had no
room to move him to thank God for it, rather than me 5
for I had seen, that he had done that already: But I
added, that it was nothing but what Reason and Huma-
nity dictated to all Men, and that we haeLas much Rea-
son as he to give Thanks to God, who had blessed us so
far as to make us the Instruments of his Mercy to so
many of his Creatures.
After this, the young Priest applied himself to his
Country-folks, laboured to compose them, persuaded,
intreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his ut-
most to keep them within the Exercise of their Reason;
and with some he had Success, though others were, for
a time, out of all Government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to Writing, as per*
haps it may be useful to those into whose Hands it may
fall, in the guiding themselves in all the Extravagancies
of their Passions; for if an Excess of Joy can carry Men
out to such a Length beyond the Reach of their Reason,
what will not the Extravagancies of Anger, Rage, and
a provoked Mind, carry us to? And indeed here I saw
Reasop for keeping an exceeding Watch over our Pas-
sions
Sons of every Kind, as well those of Joy and Satisfac-
tion, as those os Sorrow and Anger.
We were something disordered by these Extravagan-
cies among our new Guests for the first Day; but when
they had been retired, Lodgings provided for them as
well as our Ship would allow, and they had slept heartily,
as most of them did, being fatigued and frighted, they
were quite another Sort of People the next Day ,
Nothing of good Manners, or civil Acknowledge-
ments for the Kindness shewn them, was wanting; the
French, 'tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed
that Way: The Captain and one of the Priests came to
me the next Day; and, desiring to speak with me and
my Nephew the Commander, began to consult with
us what should be done with them; and first they told
os, that as we had saved their Lives, so all they had
Was little enough for a Return to us for the Kindness
received. The Captain said, they had saved some Mo-
ney, and some Things of Value, in their Boats, catch'd
hastily out of the Flames; and if we would accept it,
they were ordered to make an Offer of it all to us;
they only desired to be set on shore somewhere in our
Way, where, if possible, they might get Passage to
France.
My Nephew was for accepting their Money at first
Word, and to consider what to do with them after-
wards ; but I over-ruled him in that Part; for I knew
what it was to be set on shore in a strange Country;
and if the Portugal Captain, that took me up at Sea,
had served me so, and took all I had for my Deliver-
ance, I must have starv'd, or have been as much a Slave
at the Brasihy as I had been in Barbary, the being fold
to a Mahometan only excepted; and perhaps a Portu-
gutse is not a much better Master than a Turk> if not in
some Cases a much worse.
I therefore told the French Captain, that we had
taken them up in their Distress, it was true; but that
it was our Duty to do so, as we were Fellow-Crea-
tures, and as we would desire to be so delivered, if
we were in the like or any other Extremity; that we
had done nothing for them, but what we believed they
would have done for us, if we had been in their Cafe,
and
3
a*id they in ours j but that we took , them up to serve
them, not to plunder them; and that it would be a mot
barbarous Thing to take that Little from them whick
they had saved out of the Fire, and thea set them on
shore, and leave them; that this would be first to sav*
them from Death, and then kill them ourselves; save
them from drowning, and abandon them to starving 5
and therefore I would not let the least Thing be taken
from them: As to setting them on stio/pe7"f-told then
indeed, that was an exceeding Difficulty to us, rqr that
the Ship was bound to the East-Indies ; \ and though we
were driven out of our Course to the Westward a verjr
great Way, which perhaps was directed by Heavea on
purpose for their Deliverance, yet it was impossible sot
us wilfully to change our Voyage on this particular Ac-
count; nor could my Nephew, the Captain, answer it
to the Freighters, with whom he was under Charter-
party to pursue his Voyage by the Way of Brafil; and
all I knew we could do for them, was to put ourselves
in the Way of meeting with other Ships homeward-
bound from the Weft-Indies, and get them Pallage, if
possible, to England or France,
The first Part of the Proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but
they were in a great Consternation, especially the Pas-
sengers, at the Notion of being carried away to the
East-Indies; they then intreated me, that feeing I was
driven so far to the Westward, before I met with them,
I would at least keep on the same Course to the Banks
of Newfoundlands where it was possible I might meet
with some Ship or Sloop that they might hire to cany
them back to Canada, from whence they came*
I thought, this was but a reasonable Request on their
Part; and therefore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed
I considered, that to carry this whole Company to the
East-Indus, would not only be an intolerable Severity- to
the poor People, but would be ruining our whole Voy-
age by devouring all our Provisions; Ib I thought it no
Breach of Charter-party, but what an unforeseen Acci-
dent made absolutely necessary to us; and in which no
one could fay we were to blame; for the Laws of God
and Nature would have forbid, that we should refofe
to take up two Boats full of People in such a distressed
Condi uoa 5
Condition; and the Nature of the Thing as well re-
specting ourselves, as the poor People, obliged us to fed
them on shore somewhere or other, for their Deliver-
&hce; so I consented that we would carry them to New-
foundland y if Wind and Weather would permit; and,
if not, that I would carry them to Martinico in the
West-Indies.
The Wind continued frelh Easterly, but the Weather
pretty good; and as it had blowed continually in the
Points between N. E. and S. E. a long Time, we miffed
several Opportunities of fending them to Francs for
we met several Ships bound to Europe, whereof two
Were French, from St. Christopher**; but they had been
so long beating up against the Wind, that they durst
take in no Passengers for fear of wanting Provisions
for the Voyage, as well for themselves as for those
they should take in j so we were obliged to go on. It
was about a Week after this that we made the Banks of
Newfoundland, where, to shorten, my Story, we put all
our French People on board a Bark, which they hir'd
at Sea there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to
carry them to France, if they could get Provision to
victual themselves with: When, I fay, all the French
went on shore, I should remember, that the young
Priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East-
Indies, desired to go the Voyage with us, and to be set
On shore on the Coast of Coromandel: I readily agreed
to that; for I wonderfully liked the Man, and had very
good Reason, as will appear afterwards; also four of
the Seamen entered themselves in our Ship, and prov'd
very useful Fellows.
From hence we directed our Course for the West-
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about 20 Days
together, sometimes little or no Wind at all, when we
met with another Subject for our Humanity to work up-
on, almost as deplorable as that before.
It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes N.
and the 19th Day of March, 1694-5. when we 'fpy'd
a Sail, our Course S. E. and by S. We soon perceiv'd
it was a large Vessel, and that she bore up to Us; but
couid not at first know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her Main-
topmast, Fore-mast, and Boltfprit; and presently she
fir/**
Æres a Gun as a Signal of Distress; the Weather was
pretty good, Wind at N. N.W. a fresh Gale, and w,e
soon came to speak with her.
We found her a Ship of Bristol, bound home from
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the Road at
Barbadoesy a few Days before she was ready to fail, by
a terrible Hurricane, while the Captain and chief Mate
were both gone on Shore; so that, beside the Terror of
.the Storm, they were but in an indifferent Cafe for good
Artists to bring the Ship home: They had been already
nine Weeks at Sea, and had met with another terrible
Storm, after the Hurricane was over, which had blown
them -quite out of their Knowledge to the Westward,
and in which they lost their .Masts, as above; they told
42S, they expected to have seen .the Bahama Istands, but
were then driven away again to the South-east, by a
strong Gale of Wind at N. N. W. the fame that blew
now, and having no Sails to work the Ship with, but a
Main-course, and a kind of square Sail upon a Jury-fore-
mast, which they had set up, they could not lie near .the
Wind, but were-endeavouring to .stand .away for the£#-
varies.
But that which was worst of all, was, that they were
almost starved for want of Provisions, besides the Fatigues
they had undergone; their Bread and Flesh was quite
gone, they had not an Ounce left in the Ship, and had
Jiad none tor 11 Days; the only Relief they had, was,
their Water was not all spent, and they had about half a
Barrel of Flour left; they had Sugar enough some
Succades or Sweet-meats they had at first, but they
were devoured, and they had seven Casks of Rum.
There was a Youth and his Mother, .and a Maid ser-
vant, on board, who were going Passengers, and think-
ing the Ship was ready to fail, unhappily came on
.board the Evening before the Hurricane began; and*
having no Provisions of their own left, they were in a
more deplorable Condition than the rest; for the -Sea-
men, being reduced to such an extreme Necessity them-
selves, had no Compassion, we may be sure, for the
poor Passengers; and they were indeed in a Condition
that their Misery is very hard to describe.
Yol. U. NQ. Hv D i had
I had perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curiosity
It&d not led me, the Weather being fair, and the Wind
abated, to go on board the Ship: The second Mate,
Who upon tnis Occasion commanded the Ship, had been,
Gn board our Ship; and he told me indeed, that they
had three Passengers in the great Cabin, that they were
in a deplorable Condition j nay, fays he, I believe they
are dead, for I have heard nothing of them far above
two Days j and I was afraid to inquire after them, said
he, for I had nothing to relieve them with.
We immediately applied ourselves to give them what
Relief we could spare; and indeed I had so far over-
ruled Things with my Nephew, that I would have
victualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia\
or any Part of the Coast of America, to have supplied
ourselves 5 bat there was no Necessity for that.
But now they were in a new Danger; for they were
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave
them; the Mate or Commander brought fix Men with
him in his Boat; but these poor Wretches IpokM like
skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardly fit to
their Oars: The Mate himself was very ill, and half-
ilaTved; for he declared he had reserved nothing from
the Men, and went Share and Share alike with them, in
every bit they eat.
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set Meat before
him immediately, and he had not eaten three Mouthful*
before he began to be sick, and out of Order; so he
stopt awhile, and our Surgeon mixed him up something
with some Broth, which he said would be to him both
Pood and Physick; and after he had taken it, he grew
better: In the mean time, I forgot not the Men; I or-
ders Victuals to be given them, and the poor Creatures
rather devoured than eat it; they were so exceeding
liungry, that they were in a Manner ravenous, and had no
Command of themselves; and two of them eat with so
much Greediness, that they were in J)anger of their Lives
the next Morning.
The Sight of these Peoples Distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible Pro-
spect of at niy ijirst'coming on Shore in my Island, where
I had not the least Mouthful of Food, or any Hopes of
procuring it; besides the hourly Apprehension I had
• '' of
of being made the Food os other Creatures. But all
the while the Mate was thus relating to me the misera-
ble Condition os the Ship's Company, I could not put
out of my Thought the Story he had told me of the
three poor Creatures in the great Cabin; (viz.) the
Mother, her Son, and the Maid-servant, whom he had
heard nothing of for two or three Days; and whom he
feenVd to confess they had wholly neglected, their own
Extremities being so great; by which I understood
that they had really given them no Food at all j and
that therefore they must be peristied, and be all lying
dead perhaps on the Floor or Deck of the Cabin.
As I therefore kept the Mate, whom we then called
Captain, on board with his Men to refresh them, so I
also forgot not the starving Crew that were lest on
board, but ordered my own Boat to go on board the
Ship, and with my Mate*and twelve Men to carry them
a Sack of Bread, and four or five Pieces of Beef to boil.
Our Surgeon charged the Men to cause the Meat to be
boiled while the/ stayed, and to keep Guard in the
Cook-room, to prevent the Mens taking it to eat raw.
or taking it out of the Pot before it was well boiled,
and then to give every Man but a little at a time; and
by this Caution he preserved the Men, who would
otherwise have killed themselves with that very Food
that was given them on purpose to save their Lives.
At the fame time, I ordered the Mate to go into the
great Cabin, and fee in what Condition the poor Pas-
sengers were in, and, if they were alive, to comfort
them, and give them what Refreshment was proper;
and the Surgeon gave him a large Pitcher with some
of the prepared Broth which he had given the Mate
that was on board, and which he did not question
would restore them gtadually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above,
having a great Mind to see the Scene os Misery, which
I knew the Ship itself would present me with, in a
more lively Manner than I could have it by Report, J
took the Captain of the Ship, as we now called him,
with me, and went myself a little after in their-JBoat.
I sound the poor Men on board almost in a Tumult
to get the Victuals out of the Boiler before it was ready:
But my Mate observed his Order, and kcot a good
D 2 * G\&r4
Guard at the Cook-room Door; and the Man he
placed there, aster using all possible Persuasion to have
Patience, kept them off by Force: However, he caused
some Biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the Pot, and softened
them with the Liquor of the Meat, which they call
Brewis, and gave them every one One, to stay their
Stomachs, and told them it was for their own Safety
that he was obliged to give them but little at a time.
But it was all in vain, arid had I not come on board,
and their own Commander and Officers with me, and
with good Words, and some Threats also of giving
them no more, I believe they would have broke into
the Cook-room by Force, and tore the Meat out of the
Furnace; for Words indeed are of very small Force to
an hungry Belly: However we pacified them, and fed
them gradually and cautiously for the first time, and
the next time gav« them more, and at last filled their
Bellies, and the Men did well enough.
But the Misery of the poor Pastengers iri the Cabin
Was of another Nature, arid far beyond the rest; for as,
first * the Ship's Company had so little for themselves,
it was but too true, that they had at first kept them very
low, and at last totally neglected them; so that for six
or seven Days, it might be said, they had really had no
Food at air, arid for several Days before, very little.
The poor Mother, who, as the first Mate reported, was
a Woman of good Sense, and good Breeding, had
spared all Ihe could get so affectionately for her Son,
that at last she intirely sunk under it: And when the
Mate of our Ship went in, she sat upon the Floor or
Deck, with her Back up against the Sides, between two
Chairs, which were lalhed fast, and her Head funk in
between her Shoulders, like a Corpse, though not quite
dead. My Mate said all he could to revive and encourage
her, and with a Spoon put some Broth into her Mouth \
lhe opened her Lips, and lifted up one Hand, but could
not speak; yet she understood what he said, and made
Signs to him, intimating, that it was too late for her;
but pointed to her Child, as if slie would have said,
they should take care of him.
However the Mate, who was exceedingly moved
with the Sight, endeavoured to get some of the Broth
into her Mouth; and, as he* said, got mo or three
Spoonfuls
Spoonfuls down, tho"1 I question whether he could -be
sure of it or not: But it was too late, £nd {he died the
fame Night.
The Youth, who was preserved at the Price of hi*
most affectionate Mother's Life, was not so far gone;
yet he lay in a Cabin-bed as one stretched out, with
hardly .any Life left in him; he had a Piece of an eld
Glove in his Mouth, having eaten up the rest of it;
however, being young, and having more Strength than
his Mother, the Mate got something down his Throat,
and he began sensibly to revive, though by giving him
some time after but two or three Spoonfuls extraordinary,
He was very sick, and brought it up again.
But the next Care was the poor Maid; me lay all
along upon the Deck, hard by her Mistress, and just
like one that had fallen down with an Apoplexy, and
struggled for Life: Her Limbs were distorted, one of
her Hands was clasped round the Frame of <tae Chair,
and me griped it so hard, that we coufd not easily make
her let it go 5 her other Arm lay over her Head, and her
Feet lay both together, set fast against the Frame of the
Cabin-table; in short, (he lay just like one in the last
Agonies of Death; and yet she was alive too.
The poor Creature was not only starved with Hun-
ger, and terrified with the Thoughts of Death, but, as
the Men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her
Mistress, whom she saw dying two or diree Daye before,
and whom ihe loved most tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor Girl; for
when our Surgeon, who was a Man of very great
Knowledge and Experience, and with great Application
recovered her, as to Life, he had her upon his Hand as
to her Senses, for Ihe was iktle less than distracted for
a considerable time after; as shall appear presently.
Whoever lhall read these Merjwmndums, must be de-
sired to consider, that Visits at'Sea are not like a Jour-
ney into the Country, where sometimes People stay a
Week or a Fortnight at a Place. Our Business was to
relieve this distressed Ship's Crew^ but not lie by for
them; aud though they were willing to steer the fame
Course with us for some Days, yet we could carry no
Sail to keep Pace with a Ship that had no Masts : How-
ever, as their Captain begged of us to help him to set up
3 a
a Maln-tOp-mast, and a kind of Top-mast to his Jury-
Fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three of
four Days, and then having given him five Barrels of
Beef and Pork; two Hogsheads of Biscuit, and a Propor-
tion of Peas, Flour, and what other Things we could
spare; and taking three Casks of Sugar and some Rum,
and some Pieces of Eight of them for Satisfaction; we
left them, taking on board with us, at their own earnest
Request, the Youth, a^rid the Maid, and all their Goods.
The young Lad was about seventeen Years of Age,
a pretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible Youth; greatly
dejected with the Loss of his Mother, and, as it seems,
had lost his Father but a few Months before at Bar-
hadoes. He begged of the Surgeon to speak to me, to
take him out of the Ship; for he said the cfuel Fellows
had murdered his Mother; and indeed so they had, that
is to fay, fajft<vely; for they might have spared a small
Sustenance to the poor helpless' Widow, that might have
preserved her Life, though it had been just to keep her
alive. But Hunger knows no Friend, no Relation, no
Justice, no Right; and therefore is remorseless, and ca-
pable of no Compassion.
The Surgeon told him how far we were going,- and
> how it would carry him away from all his Friends, and
put him perhaps in as bad Circumstances almost, as we
found them in; that is to fay, starving in the World.
He said ne mattered not whither he went, if he was but
delivered from the terrible Crew that he was among:
That the Captain (by which he meant me, for he could
know nothing of my Nephew) had saved his Life, an4 he
was sure would not hurt him ; and as for the Maid, he was
sure, if she came to herself, she would be very thankful
for it, let us carry them whither we would. The Sur-
feon represented the Case so affectionately to me, that
yielded, and we took them both on board with all
their Goods, except eleven Hogsheads of Sugar, which
could not be removed, or come at j and as the Youth
Jiad a Bill of Lading for them, I made his Commander
sign a Wiidng, obliging him to go, as soon as he
came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a Merchant there,
to whom the Youth said he was related, and to deliver
a Letter which I wrote to him, and all the Goods he
had
fead belonging to the deceases Widow, j which I sup.
pose was not done; for I could never learn, that the
Ship came to Bristol; but was, as \s most probable, lost
at Sea, being in so disabled a Condition, and so far from
any Land, that I am of Opinion, the first Storm she met
with afterwards, she might sounder in the Sea j for she
was leaky, and had Damage in her Hold,, whoa I met
with her.
I was now in the Latitude of 19 Peg. 32 Min. and
had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, th©'
at first the Winds had been contrary. I shall trouble no-
body with the little Incidents of Wind, Weather, Cut-
rents, &c. on the rest of our Voyage; but, shortening
my Story for the Sake of what is to follow, shall ob-
serve that I came to my old Habitation, the Island, on
the 10th of April, 1695. It was with no small Diffi-
culty that I found the Place; for as I came to it, and
Went from it before, on the South and East-fide of the
Island, as coming from the Brajih, £0 now coming in
between the Main and the Island, and having no Chart
for the Coast, nor any Land-mark, I did not know it
when I fawi t, or know whether I saw it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on
several Islands in the Mouth of the great River Ore?«-
veque, but none for my Purpose; only this I learned by
my coasting the Shore, that I was under one great Mi-
stake before, <viz. that the Continent which I thought I
saw, from the Island I lived in, was really no Continent,
but a long Island, pr rather a Kijdge of Islands, reaching
from one to the other Side of the extended Mouth of
that great River; and that the Savages who came to my
Island, were not properly those which we -call Cariheef,
but Islanders, and other Barbarian* of: the fame King,
who inhabited something nearer to our Side than the reft.
In stiort, J visited several of the Islands to no Pur-
pose; some I found were inhabited, and some were sot.
On one of them I found some Spaniards t and thought
they had lived there; but, speaking with them, found
they had a Sloop lay in a small Creek hard by, and that
they came thither to make Salt, and to catch some Pearl-
muscles, if they could ; but they belonged to the Isle
Je Trmidad, which lay farther North, in the Latitude
of 10 and 11 Degrees.
Thus
Thus coasting from one Island to another, sometimes
with the Ship, sometimes with the Frenchman* Shallop
(which we had found a convenient Boat, and therefore
•kept her with their very good Will) at length 1 came
fair on the South-side ot my Island, and I presently
k«ew the very Countenance of the Place; so I brought
the-Ship safe to an Anchor, Broadside with the little
Creek where was my old Habitation.
As soon as I saw the Place, I called for Friday, and
aslced him, if he knew where he was? He looked
about a little, and presently, clapping his Hands, cried;
O yes, O there, O yes, O there, pointing to our old Habita-
tion, and fell a dancing and capering like a mad Fellow,
and I had much ado to keep him from jumping into the
"Sea, to swim ashore to the Place.
Well, Friday, said I, do you think we shall £nd any
tody here or no? And what do you think, ihall we
see your Father? The Fellow stood mute aa a Stock a
good while; but when I named his Father, the poor
affectionate Creature looked dejected; and I could fee
the Tears run down his Face very plentifully. What is
the Matter, Friday, said I? Are you troubled because
you may see your Father? No, no, fays he, making his
Head, no fee him more, no ever-more fee again. Why
so, said I, Friday? How do you know that? O no, O no,
says Friday, he long ago die; long ago, he much old
Man. Well, well, said I, Friday, you don't know: But
shall we fee any one else then? The Fellow, it seems,
Jiad better Eyes than I, and he points just to the Hill above
tny old House; and tho' we lay half a League off, he
cries out, Me see! me fee! yes, yes, me fee much Man
there, and there, and there. I looked, but I could see
nobody, no, not with a Perspective-glass; which was, I
suppose, because I could not hit the Place; for the Fel-
low was right, as I found upon Inquiry the next Day,
and there were five or fix Men altogether stood to look
at the Shi£, not knowing what to think of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he sew People, I caus'd
the EngUJb Ancient to be spread, and fired three Guns,
to give them Notice we were Friends; and about half
a. Quarter of an Hour after, we perceived a Smoke rise
from the Side of the Creek; so I immediately ordered
a Boat out, taking Friday with me-; aud, hanging out a
white
White Flag, or a Flag of Truce, I went directly on
shore, taking with me the young Frier I mentioned, to
Whom I had told the whole Story of my living there,
and the Manner of it, and every Particular, both of my-
self, and those that I left there; and who was on that
Account extremely desirous to go with me. We had
besides about sixteen Men very well armed, if we had
found any new Guest there which we did not know of;
but we had no need of Weapons.
As we went on more upon the Tide of Flood, near
high Water, we rowed directly into the Creek; and
the sirst Man I fixed my Eye upon, was the Spwiiard
whose Life I had saved, and whom I knew by his Face
perfectly well; as to his Habit, I shall describe it after-
wards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at sirst but my-
self, but there was no keeping Friday in the Boat; for*
the affectionate Creature had spied his Father at a Di-
stance, a good Way off of the Spaniards, where indeed
I saw nothing of him; and if they had not let him go
on more, he would have jumped into the Sea. He was
no sooner on more, but he flew away to his Father
like an Arrow out of a Bow. It would have made any
Man shed Tears, in spite of the firmest Resolution, to
have seen the first Transports of this poor Fellow's Joy,
when he came to his Father j how he embraced him*
kissed him, stroaked his Face, took him up in his Arms*
set him down upon a Tree, and lay down by him;
then stood and looked at him, as any one would look
at a strange Picture, for a Quarter of an Hour together;
then lay down upon the Ground, and stroaked his Le^s,
and kiss'd them, and then got up again, and star'd at him*
one would have thought the Fellow bewitched: But it
would have made a Dog laugh to fee how the next Day
his Passion ran out another way: In the Morning hft
walked along the Shore, to-and-again, with his Father*
several Hours, always leading him by the Hand, as if
he had been a Lady; and every now-and-then would
Come to fetch something or other for him to the Boat,
either a Lump of Sugar^ or a Dram, a Biscuit, or some-
thing or other that was good. In the Afternoon his
Frolicks ran another way, for then he would set the old
Man down upon the Ground, and dance about him, and
made a thousand antick Postures and Gestures; and all
Vol. II. E the
the while he did this, he would be talking to him, and
telling him one Story or another of his Travels, and of
what had happened to him Abroad, to divert him. In
short, if the fame filial Affection was to be found in
Christians to their Parents, in our Parts of the World,
one would be tempted to fay, there hardly would have
been any Need of the Fifth Commandment.
But this is a Digression; I return to my Landing. It
would be endless to take notice of all the Ceremonies
and Civilities that the Spaniards received me with. The
first Spaniards whom as I said, I knew very well,
was he whose Life I saved; he came towards the Boat,
attended by one more, carrying a Flag of Truce also;
and he did not only not know me at first, but he had no
Thoughts, no Notion, of its being me that was come,
till I spoke to him: Seignior, said I, in Portuguese, do you
not know me? At which he spoke not a Word; but
giving his Mufquet to the Man that was with him,
threw his Arms abroad, and faying something in Spanijhr
that I did not perfectly hear, came forward, and em-
braced me, telling me he was inexcusable, not to know
that Face again, that he had once seen, as of an Angel
from Heaven, sent to save his Life: He said abundance
of very handsome Things, as a well-bred Spaniard al-
ways knows how; and then beckoning to the Person
that attended him, bad him go and call out his Com-
rades. He then alked me, if I would walk to my old
Habitation, where he would give me Possession of my
own House again, and where I should see there had been
but mean Improvements; so I walked along with him;
but, alas! I could no more find the Place again, than
if I had never been there j for they had planted so many
Trees, and placed them in such a Posture, so thick
and close to one another, in ten Years time they were
grown so big, that, in fiort, the Place was inaccessible,
except by such Windings, and blind Ways, as they
themselves only, who made them, could find.
I asked them, what put them upon all these Fortifi-
cations? He told me, I would fay there was Need enough
of it, when they had given an Account how they had
passed their Time since their arriving in the Iiland, espe-
cially after they had the Misfortune to find, that I was
gone; He told me he could not but have some SattfV
6 faction
faction in my good Fortune, when he heard that I
was gone in a good .Ship, and to my Satisfaction; a*id
that he had oftentimes a strong Persuasion, that one time
or other he should see me again : But nothing that eveF
befel him in his Life, he said, was so surprising and af-
flicting to him at first, as the Disappointment he was un-
der when he came back to the Island; and found I was
not there.
As to the three Barbarians (so he .called them) that
were left behind, and of whom he said he had a long
Story to tell me; the Spaniards all thought themselves
much better among the Savages, only that their Num-
ber was so small. And, says he, had they been strong
enough, we had been all long ago in Purgatory; and
with that Jae cross\1 himself upon the Breast: But, Sir,
says Le, I hope you will not be displeased, when I stiali
tell you how, forced by Necessity, we were obliged,
for our own Preservation, to disarm them, and making
them our Subjects, who would not be content with
being moderately our Masters, but would be our Mur-
derers. I answered, I was heartily afraid of it when
I left them there j and nothing troubled me at my part-
ing from the Istand, but .that .they were not come back^
that I might have put them in Possession of every
thing first, aud left the other in a State of Subjection,
as they deserved: But if they had reduced them to it,
I was very glad, and should be very far from finding
any Fault with it; for I knew they were a Parcel of
refractory ungovernable Villains, and were fit for any
manner of Mischief.
While I was saying this, came the Man whom he
had sent back,Vand with him eleven Men more: In
the Dress they were in, it was impossible to guess
what Nation they were of; but he made all clear both
to them and to me. First he turned to me, and point-
ing to them, said, These, Sir, are some of the Gentle-
men who owe their Lives to you; and then turning
to them, and pointing to me, lie let them know who
I was; upon which they ajl came up one by one, not
as if they had been Sailors, and ordinary Fellows, and
I the like, but really, as if they had been Ambassadors
or Noblemen, and I a Monarch, or a great Conqueror:
Their Behaviour was to the last Degree obliging ant|
? 2 courteous.
courteous, and yet mix'd with a manly, majestic Gra-
vity, which very well became them; and, in short,
they had so much more Manners than I, that I scarce
knew how to receive their Civilities, much less how tq
return them in kind.
The History of their coming to, and Conduct in the
Istand, af;er my going away, is so remarkable, and has
so many Incidents, which the former Part of my Re-
lation will help to understand, and which will, in most
of the Particulars, refer to that Account 1 have already
given, that I cannot but commit them with great De-
light to the Reading of those that come after me.
I shall no longer trouble the Story with a Relation
in the first Person, which will put me to the Expence
of ten thousand said /V, and said his^ and he told me*s9
and / told hims, and the like; but I mall collect the
Facts historically, as near as I can gather them out of
jny Memory from what they related to me, and from
what I met with in my conversing with them, and with
{he Place.
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I
can, I must go back to the Circumstance in which I left
the Island, and which the Persons were in, of whom
I am to speak. At first it is necessary to repeat, that I
had sent away Friday's Father and the Spaniard, the two
whose Lives I had rescued from the Savages; I fay,
I had sent them away in a large Canoe to the Main as
I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniards Companions
whom he had left behind him, in order to save them from
the like Calamity that he had been in; and in order tQ
succour them for the present, and that, if possible, we
might together find some way for our Deliverance after-
ward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible Appearance
of, or the least Room to hope for, my own Deliverance,
any more than I had twenty Years before; much less had
1 any Foreknowledge of what after happened, I mean of
an English Ship coming on shore there to fetch them olF,
and it could not but be a very great Surprise to them, when
they came back, not only to find, that I was gone, but to
find three Strangers left on the Spot, possessed of all that
I had left behind me. which would otherwise have been
their own. ^
The first Thing, however, which I inquired into,
£hat I might begin where I lest off, was of their owa
Part; and I desired he would give me a particular Ac-
count of his Voyage back to his Countrymen with the
Boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He told
me ther.e was little Variety in that Part; for nothing
remarkable happened to them on the Way, they having
very calm Weather, and a smooth Sea; for his Coun-
trymen, it could not be doubted, he said, but that they
were overjoyed to see him: (It seems he was the prin-
cipal Man among them, the Captain of the Vessel they
had been shipwreck'd in,' having been dead some time :)
They were, he said, the more surprised to see him, be-
cause they knew that he was fallen into the Hands of
Savages, who, they were satisfy 7d, would devour him,
as they did all the rest of their Prisoners; that when he
told them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what
Manner he was furninVd for carrying them away, it was
like a Dream to them; and their Astonishment, they said,
was something like that of Joseph's Brethren, when he
told them who he was, and told them the Story of his
Exaltation in Pharaoh* s Court: But when he shewed them
the Arms, the Powder, the Ball, and the Provisions that
he brought them for their Journey or Voyage, they were
restored to themselves, took a just Share of the Joy of
their Deliverance, and immediately prepared to come
away with him.
Their first Business was to get Canoes; and in thi$
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the ho-
nest Part of it, but' to trespass upon their friendly Sa-
vages, and to borrow two large Canoes or Periagua's,
on Pretence of going out a Fishing, or for Pleasure.
In these they came away the next Morning; it seems*
they wanted no Time to get themselves ready, for they
had no Baggage, neither Cloaths, or Provisions, or any
thing in the World, but what they had on them, and a
few Roots to eat, of which they us'd to make their Bread.
They were in all three Weeks absent, and in that"
time, unluckily for them, I had th^e Occasion offered
for my Escape, as I mentioned in my other Part, and
to get off from the Island; leaving three of the most
|mpudent, hardens, ungovensd, disagreeable Villains
behind
.behind me, that any Man could desire to meet with,
to the poor Spaniards great Grief and Disappointment,
you may be sure.
The only just Thing the Rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came to ihore, they gave my Letter to them,
and gave them Provisions, and other Relief, as I had
ordered them to do; also they gave them the long Paper
of Directions, which I had left with them, containing the
particular Methods which I took for managing every Part
of my Life there, the Way how I baked my Bread, bred
up my tame Goats, and planted my Corn, how I cured
my Grapes, made my Pots, and, in a Word, every thing
I did; all this being written down, they gave to the
Spaniards, two of whom understood Englijb well enough j
nor did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with
any thing else, for they agreed very well for some time;
they gave them an equal Admission into the House, or
Cave, and they began to live very sociably; and the
Head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my Me-
thod, and Friday s Father together, managed all their
Affairs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but
ramble about the Island, moot Parrots, and catch Tor-
toises, and when they came home at Night, the Spaniards
provided their Suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
would the other but have let them alone, which, how-
ever, they could not find in their Hearts to do long;
but, like the Dog in the Manger, they would not eat
themselves, and would not let others eat neither: The
Differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and
such as are not worth relating; but at lait it broke out
into open War, and it began with all the Rudeness and
Jnfolence that can be imagined, without Reason, with-
out Provocation, contrary to Nature, and indeed, to
common Sense; and tho' it is true, the first Relation
of it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom I
may call the Accusers, yet when 1 came to examine
the Fellows, they could not deny a Word of it.
But before I come to the Particulars of this Part, I
must supply a Defect in my former Relation; and this
was, that I forgot to set down among the rest, that,
just as we were weighing the Anchor to set sail, there
* hap-
happened a little Quarrel on board our Ship, which I was
afraid once would turn to a second Mutiny; nor was i€
appeased, till the Captain, rousing up his Courage, and
taking us all to his Assistance, parted them by Force,
and making two of the most refractory Fellows Prison-
ers, he laid them in Irons; and as they had been acti/e
in the former Disorders, and let fall some ugly danger-
ous Words the second time, he threatened to carry
them in Irons to England, and have them hang'd there
for Mutiny, and running away with the Ship.
This, it seems, though the Captain did not intend to
do it, frighted some other Men in the Ship; and some
of them had put it in the Heads of the rest, that the Cap-
tain only gave them good Words for the present, till
they should come to some Engl'ijh Port; and that then they
should be all put into a Goal, and try'd for their Lives.
The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with it; upon which it was destrM, that I, who still
passed for a great Man among them, should go down
with the Mate, and satisfy the Men, and tell them, that
they might be assured, if they behaved well the rest of
the Voyage, all they had done for the time past, should
be pardon'd. So I went, and after passing my Houeurs
Word to them, they appeared easy, and the more so,
when I causM the two Men, who were in Irons, to be
released and forgiven.
But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for
that Night, the Wind also failing calm ; next Morning
we found, that our two Men who had been laid in
Irons, had stole each of them a Mufquet, and some
other Weapons; what Powder or Shot they had, we
know not; and had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which,
was not yet haled up, and run away with her to their
Companions in Roguery, on more.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the Long-boat on
shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and away they
went to seek the Rogues; but they could neither imd
them, nor any of the restfor they all fled into the Woods,
when they saw the Boat coming on shore. The Mate
was once refolv'd, in Justice to their Roguery, to have
destroy'd their Plantations, burnt all their Houstiold-ftufF
and Furniture, and left them lo shift without it; but
having
having no Order, he let all alone, lest every thing a*
Mizy found it, and, bringing the Pinnace away, came
on board without them.
These two Men made their Number five, but the
other three Villains were so much wickeder than these,
that aster they had been two or three Days together,
they turn'd their two New-comers out of Doors to
shift for themselves, and would have nothing to do
\vjth them, nor could they, for a good while, be per-
suaded to give them any Food; as for the Spaniards,
they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on shore, the Business
began to go forward; the Spaniards would have per-
suaded the three English Brutes to have taken in their
two Countrymen again, that, as they said, they might
be all one Family; but they would not hear of it: So
the two poor Fellows liv'd by themselves, and, finding
nothing but Industry and Application would make
them live comfortably, they pitch'd their Tents on the
North Shore of the Island, but a little more to the West,
to be out of the Danger of the Savages, who always
landed on the East Parts of the Island.
Here they built two Huts, one to lodge in, and the
"other to lay up their Magazines and Stores in; and
the Spaniards having given them some Corn for Seed;
and especially some of the Peas which I had left thern^
they dug) and planted, and inclos'd, after the Pattern I
had set for them all, and began to live pretty well;
their first Crop of Corn was on the Ground, and though
it was but a little Bit of Land which they had dug up
at first, having had but a little Time, yet it was enough
to relieve them, and find them with Bread, and other
Eatables ; and one of the Fellows, being the Cook's Mate
of the Ship, was very ready at making Soup, Puddings,
and such other Preparations, as the Rice, and the Milk*
and such little Flesh as they got, furnished him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving Posture, when
the three unnatural Rogues, their own Countrymen too,
in mere Humour, and to insult them, came and bully\i
them, and told them the Island was theirs; that the Go-
vernor, meaning me, had given them Possession of it,
and nobody else had any Right to it ; and, damn them,
they
3
they should build no Houses upon their Ground, unless m
they would pay them Rent for them.
The two Men thought they had jested at first; and
afk'd them to come and sit down, and fee what sine
Houses they were, that they had built, and tell them
what Rent they demanded: And one of them merrily
told them; if they were Ground-Landlords, he hop'd,
if they built Tenements upon the Land, and made Im-
provements, they would, according to the Custom of
all Landlords, grant them a long Lease; and bid them
go fetch a Scrivener to draw the Writings. One of the
three, damning and raging, told them, they should fee
they were not in Jest; and going to a little Place at a
Distance, where the honest Men had made a Fire to
dress their Victuals, he takes a Fireband, and claps it
to the Outside of their Hut, and very fairly set it on
Fire; and it would have been all burnt down in a few
Minutes, if one of the two had not run to the Fellow,
thrust him away, and trod the Fire out with his Feet,
and that npt without some Difficulty too.
The Fellow was in such a Rage at the honest Man's
thrusting him away, that he turn'd upon him with a
Pole he had in his Hand; and had not the Man avoided
the Blow very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he had
ended his Days at once. His Comrade, seeing the Dan-
ger they were both in, ran in after him, and immediately
they came both out with their Musquets; and the Man
that was first struck at with the Pole, knock'd the Fel-
low down, who began the Quarrel, with the Stock of
the Musquet, and that before the other two could come
to help him; and then seeing the rest come at them,
they stood together, and presenting the other Ends of
their Pieces to them, bade them stand off.
The other had Fire-arms with them too j but one of
the two honest Men, bolder than his Comrade, and made
desperate by his Danger, told them, if they offered to
move Hand or Foot, they were all dead Men; and boldly-
commanded them to lay down their Arms. They did
not, indeed, lay down their Armsbut seeing him re-
solute, it brought them to a Parley, and they consented
to take their wounded Man with them, and be gone;
and indeed, it seems the Fellow was wounded sufficient-
ly with the Blow; however, they were much in the
Vol. II. F Wrong,
Wrong, since they had the Advantage, that they did not
disarm them effectually, as they might have done, and
have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them
an Account hpw the Rogues had treated them j for the
three Villains study'd nothing but Revenge, and every
Bay gave them some Intimation that they did so.
But nqt to croud this Part with an Account of the
lesser Part of their Rogueries, such as treading down their
Corn, shooting three young Kids, and a She Goat,
which the poor Men had got to breed up tame for their
Store; and, in a word, plaguing them Night and Day in
this Manner; it forced the two Men to such a Despera-
tion, that they resolved to fight them all three the first
time they had a fair Opportunity. In order to this they
resolved to go to the Castle, as they calPd it, that was
xny old Dwelling, where the three Rogues and the
Spaniards all liv'd together, at that time; intending to
have a fair Battle, apd the Spaniards ihould stand by to
fee fair Play. So they goc up in thg. Morning before
Day, and came to the Place, and calTd the Englijbmen
by their Names, telling a Spaniard that answered, that
they wanted to speak with them.
It happened that the Day before, two of the Spaniards,
having been in the Woods, had seen one of the two
Englijbmen, whom, for Distinction, I call the Honest
Men'i and he had made a sad Complaint to the Spani-
ards, of the barbarous Usage th^y had met with from
their three Countrymen, and how they had ruined their
Plantation, and destroyed their Corn, that they had la-
boured so hard to bring forward, and kilPd the Milch-
goat, and their three Kids, which was all they had
provided for their Sustenance; and that if he and his
Friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them
again, they should be starv'd. When the Spaniards
came home at Night, and they were all at Supper, he
tpok the Freedom to reprove the three Englishmen,
though in gentle and mannerly Terms, and afk'd them,
J-ow they could be 10 cruel, they being harmless in-
offensive Fellows, and that they were putting them-
selves in a Way to subsist by their Labour, and that it
had cost them a great deal of Pains to bring Things tq
such a Perfection as they had.
One
One of the Englishmen return'd very briskly, What
had they to do there I That they came on sliore with-
out Leave, and that they should not plant or build upon
the Island j it was none of their Ground. Why, fays the
Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior Inglefe, they must not starve.
The Englijhman reply'd, like a true rough-hewn Tarpau-
lin, they might starve and be dainn'd, they should not
plant, nor build in that Place. But what must they da
then. Seignior? fays the Spaniard. Another of the Brute*
return'd, Do ! D—n them, they should be Servants, and
work for them. But how can you expecl thai of them ? They
are not bought with your Money ; you harve no Right to TftakK
them Servants. The Englishmen anfwer'd, The Island was
theirs, the Governor had given it to them, and no Man
had any thing* to do there but themselves; and with that
swore by his Maker, that they would go and burn all their
new Huts; they should build none upon their Land.
Why, Seignior, fays the Spaniard, by the fame Ruh <w*
must be your Servants too. Ay, fays the bold Dog, and
so you shall too, before we have done with you, mixing,
two or three G—d d—mine's in the proper Intervals of
his Speech. The Spaniard only fmil'd at that, and made
him no Answer. However, this little Discourse had
heated them; and starting up, one fays to the other, I
think it was he they calPd Will. Atkins, Come, Jctckt
let us go and have t'other Brusti with them; we'll de-
molish their Castle, I'll warrant you; they mall plant
ho Colony in our Dominions.
Upon this, they were all trOopirig away, with every
Man a Gun, a Pistol, and a Sword, and muttered some
insolent Things among themselves, of what they would
do to the Spaniards too, when Opportunity ofFer'd }
but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly under-
stand them, as to know all the Particulars; only, that$
in general, they threatened them hard for taking the
two Englijbmens Part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their Time,
that Evening, the Spaniards said, they did not know %
but it seems they wander'd about the Country, Part of
the Night; and then lying down in the Place which I
used to call my Bower, they were weary, and over-
slept themselves. The Case was this-: They had refolv'd
F 2 to
xo stay till Midnight, and so take the poor Men when
*hey were asleep \ and they acknowledged it afterwards,
intending to set Fire to their Huts while they were in
them, and either burn them in them, or murder them as
they came out: And as Malice seldom sleeps very found,
it was very strange they would not have been kept waking.
However, as the two Men had also a Design upon
them, as I have said, tho1 a much fairer one than that
of Burning and Murdering, it happened, and very
luckily for them all, that they were up and gone abroad,
before the bloody-minded Rogues came to their Huts.
When they came thither, and found the Men gone,
Atkins) who it seems was the forwardest Man, called out
to his Comrades, Ha! Jack, here's the Nest; but, d—n
them, the Birds are flown: They mused awhile to
think what should be the Occasion of their being
gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently, that
the Spaniards had given them Notice of it; and with
that they /hook Hands, and swore to one another, that
they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as
they had made this bloody Bargain, they fell to work
with the poor Mens Habitation; they did not set Fire
indeed to any thing, but they pulled down both their
Houses, and pulled them so Limb from Limb, that
they lest not the least Stick standing, or scarce any
Sign on the Ground where they stood; they tore all
their little collected Housliold-stufF in Pieces, and threw
every thing about in such a Manner, that the poor Men
found, afterwards, some of their Things a Mile off from
their Habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the
young Trees which the poor Men had planted; pulled
up the Inclosure they had made to secure their Cattle
and their Corn; and, in a word, sacked and plundered
every thing, as completely as a Hord of Tartars would
have done.
The two Men were at this Juncture gone to find
them out, and had resolved to fight them where-ever
they had been, though they were but two to three:
So that, had they met, there certainly would have
been Bloodshed among them; for they were all very
stout resolute Fellows, to give them their Due,
But
But Providence took more Care to keep them asun-
der, thairthey themselves could do to meet; for, as
they had dogged one another, when the three were
gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards when
the two went back to find them* the three were come
to the old Habitation again; we (hall fee their differing
Conduct presently. When the three came back, like
furious Creatures, flulhed with the Rage which the
Work they had been about put them into, they came
up to the Spaniardsmmd told them what they had done,
by way of Scoff ana Bravado; and one of them stepping
up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple
of Boys at Play, takes hold of his Hat, as it was upon
his Head; and giving it a Twirl about, fleering in his
Face, fays he to him, And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard,
shall have the fame Sauce, if you do not mend your Man-
ners. The Spaniard, who, though quite a civil Man,
was as brave as a Man could be desired to be, and
withal a strong well-made Man, looked steadily at him,
for a good while; and then, having no Weapon in
his Hand, stept gravely up to him, and with one Blow
of his Fist knocked him down, as an Ox is felled with
a Pole-ax; at which one of the Rogues, insolent as the
first, sired his Pistol at the Spaniard immediately; he
missed his. Body indeed, for the Bullets went through
his Hair, but one of them touched the Tip of his Ear,
and he bled pretty much. The Blood made the Spa-
niard believe, he was more hurt than he really was,
and that put him into some Heat, for before he acted
all in a perfect Calm; but, now resolving to go through
with his Work, he stoop'd, and took the Fellow's Muf-
quet whom he had knocked down, and was just going
to moot the Man who had sired at him; when the rest
of the Spaniards, being in the Cave, came out, and,
calling to him not to shoot, they stept in, secured the
other two, and took their Arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their Enemies, as well as their
own Countrymen, they began to cool, and, giving the
Spaniards better Words, would have had their Arms
again; but the Spaniards, considering the Feud that was
between them and the other two Englishmen, and that
it would be the best Method they could take to keep
them
them from one another, told them they would do theiri
no Harm; and if they would live peaceably they would
be very willing to assist and associate with them, as they
did before 5 but that they could not think of giving them
their Arms again, while they appeared so resolv'd to do
Mischief with them to their own Countrymen, and had
even threatned them all to make them their Servants.
The Rogues were now more capable to hear Rea-
son, than to act Reason; but, being refused their Arms*
they went raving away, and r^feg like Madmen*
threatening what they would do, tho' they had no Fire-
arms: But the Spaniards despising their Threatening;
told them they should take care how they offered any
Injury to their Plantation Or Cattle; for if they did*
they would moot them, as they would do ravenous
Beasts, where-ever they found them; and if they fell
into their Hands alive, they would certainly be hang'd.
However, this was far from cooling them; but away
they went raging and swearing like Furies of Hell.
As soon as they were gone, came back the two Meri
in Passion and Rage enough also, though of another
Kind; for having been at their Plantation, and finding
k all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily
be supposed they had Provocation enough; they could
scarce have room to tell their Tale, the Spaniards were
fb eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange enough
to find., that three Men should thus bully Nineteen*
and receive no Punistiment at all. ^_
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially
having thus disarmed them, made light of their Threat-
enings; but the two EngUJhmen resolved to have their
Remedy against them, what Pains soever it cost to find
them out.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them;
that they were already disarmed ; they could not consent,
that they (the two) should pursue them with Fire-arms,
and perhaps kill them: But, said the grave Spaniards
who was their Governor, we will endeavour to make
them do you Justice, if you will leave it to us; for as
there is no d ubc but they will come to us again \vhen
their Passion is over, being not able to subsist without
our Assistance, we promise you to make no Peace with
thcnii
them, without having a full Satisfaction for you; and
upon this Condition we hope you will promise to use
no Violence with them, other than in your Defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very aukwardly,
and with great Reluctance; but the Spaniards protested,
they did it only to keep them from Bloodshed, and to
make all easy at last; for, said they, we are not so
many of us; here is Room enough for as all, and it is
great Pity we mould not be all good Friends. At length
they did consent, and waited for the Issue of the Thing,
living for fpme Days with the Spaniards; for their own
Habitation was destroyed.
In about five Days time the three Vagrants, tired
with Wandering, and almost starv'd with Hunger, hav-
ing chiefly lived on Turtles Eggs all that while, came
back to the Grove j and finding my Spaniard, who, as
I have /aid, was the Governor, and two more with him,
walking by the Side of the Creek; they came up in a
very fuormifive humble Manner, and begged to be re-
ceived again into the Family. The Spaniards used them
civilly, but told them, they had acted so unnaturally by
their Countrymen, and so very grossly-^y them- (the
Spaniards) that'they could not come to any Conclu-
sion without consulting the two Englishmen, and the
rest; but, however, they would go to them, and dis-
course about it, and they should know in half an Hour.
It may be guefs'd, that they were very hard put to it;
for it seems, as they were to wait this Half-hour for an
Answer, they begged he would fend them out some Bread
in the mean time; which he did, and sent them at the
fame time a large Piece of Goaf s Flesh, and a broiFd
Parrot; which they eat very heartily, for they weie<
hungry enough.
After half an Hour's Consultation they were called in,
and a long Debate had about them, their two Country-*
men charging them with the Ruin of all their Labour,
and a Design to murder them; all which they own'd
before, and therefore could not deny now; upon the
Whole, the Spaniards acted the Moderators between
them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not
to hurt th« three, while they were naked and unarmed,
fo they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their
Fellows two Huts, one to be of the fame Dimensions,
and the other larger than they were before; also to
fence their Ground again, where they had pulled up'the
Fences, plant Trees in the room of those pulled up, dig
up the Land again for planting Corn, where they had
spoiled it j and, in a word, to restore every thing in the
same State, as they found it, as near as they could; for
intirely it could not be, the Season for the Corn, and the
Growth of the Trees and Hedges, not being possible to
be recovered.
Well, they all submitted to this; and as they had
Plenty of Provisions given them all the whjle, they
grew very orderly, and the whole Society began to live
pleasantly and agreeably together again only that these
three Fellows could never be persuaded to work; I
mean, not for themselves, except now-and-then a little,
just as they pleased; however, the Spaniards told them
plainly, that if they would but live sociably and friendly
together, and study in the Whole the Good of the Plan-
tation, they would be content to work for them, and let
them walk about and L>e as idle as they pleased; and thus
having liv'd pretty well together for a Month or two,
the Spaniards gave them their Arms again, and gave
them Liberty to go abroad with them as before.
It was not above a Week after they had these Arms,
and went abroad, but the ungrateful Creatures began
to be as insolent and troublesome as before; but how-
ever, an Accident happened presently upon this, which
endangered the Safety of them all; they were obliged
to lay by all private Resentments, and look to the Pre-
servation of their Lives.
It happened one Night, that the Spaniard Governor,
as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard whose Life I
had saved, who was now the Captain, or Leader, or
Governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the
Night, and could by no means get any Sleep: He was
perfectly well in Body, as he told me the Story, only
found his Thoughts tumultuous; his Mind ran upon
Men fighting, and killing one another, but was broad
awake, and could not by any means get any Sleep; in
short, he lay a great while; but, growing more and more
uneasy, he resolved to rise: As they lay, being so many
of them, npon Goat-skins, laid thick upon such Couches
and Pads, as they made for themselves, and not in Ham-
i mocks
mocks and Ship-beds, as I did, who was but one; so
they had little to do, when they were willing to rise, but
to get up upon their Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat,
such as it was, and their Pumps, and they were ready for
going any Way that their Thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out: but, being
dark, he could fee little or nothing; and besides, the
Trees which I had planted, as in my former Account
is described, and which were now grown tall, inter-
cepted his Sight, so that he cpuld only look up, and see
that it was a clear Star-light Night; and, hearing no Noise,
he returned and laid him down again; but it was all oni,
he could not steep, nor could he compose himself to any
thing like Rest, but his Thoughts were to the last Degree'
uneasy, and yet he knew not for what.
Having made some Noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them wak'd,
and, calling, alk'd, who it was that was up? The Go-
vernor told him, how it had been with him: Say you
so ? says the other Spaniard; such Things are not to be
slighted, I assure you; there is certainly some Mischief
working, says he, near us; and presently he aslc'd him,
Where are the Englishmen? They are all in their Huts,
says he, safe enough. It seems, the Spaniards had kept
Possession of the main Apartment, and had made a Place,
where the three Englishmen, since their last Mutiny,
always quartered by themselves, and could not come
at the rest. Well, fays the Spaniard, there is something,
in it, I am persuaded from my own Experience; I am
satisfied our Spirits embodied have a Converse with, and-
receive Intelligence from, the Spirits unembodied, and
inhabiting the invisible World j and this friendly Notice
is given for our Advantage, if we know how to make
use of it. Come,fays he, let us go out, and look abroad;
and if we find nothing at;all in it to justify our Trouble*.
I'll tell you a Story to the-Purpose, that mall convince
you of the Justice of my proposing it.
In a word, they went out to go: to the Top of the
Hill, where I used to go; but they,- being strong, and in
good Company, not alone, as I was, used none of my
Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and then pulling it
up after them, to go up a second Stage to tlie Top, but
Vol'. iL Np. 15, G were
were going round through the Grove unconcerned ami
unweary, when they werS surprised with seeing a Light,,
as of Fire, a very little Way off from them, and hear-
ing the Voices of Men, not of one, or two, but of a.
great Number.
In all the Discoveries I had' made of the Savages land-
ing on the Island, it was my constant Care to prevent-
them making the least Discovery of there being any In-
habitant upon the Place; and when by any Necessity
they came to know it; they felt it so effectually, that
they that got away, were scarce able to give any Ac-
count of it; for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor
did ever any that had seen me, escape to tell any one
else, except it were the three Savages in our last En-
counter, who jumped into, the Boat, of whom I men-
tioned, that I was afraid they mould go Home, and
bring more Help.
"Whether it was the Consequence of the Escape of
those Men, that so great a Number came now toge-
ther; or whether they came ignorantly, and by Acci-
dent, on their usual bloody Errand; the Spaniards could
not it seems understand: But whatever it was, it had
been their Business, either to have conceal'd themselves,
and not have seen them at all; much less to have let the
Savages have seen, that there were any Inhabitants in the
Place; but to have fallen upon them, so effectually, as
that not a Man of them mould have escaped, which-
could only have been by getting in between them and,
their Boats; but this Presence of Mind was. wanting to
them> which was the. Ruin of their Tranquility for a
great while.
We need not doubt, but that the Governor, and the-
Man with him, surprised with this Sight, ran back im-
mediately, and raised their Fellows, giving them-an Ac-
count of the imminent Danger they were all in j and they
again as readily took the Alarm, but it was impossible to •
persuade them to stay close within where they were, but
that they must run all out to see how Things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well enough,,
and they had Opportunity enough for some Hours, to
view them by the Light of three Fires, they had made
at some Distance from one another > what they were
doing.
«doing, they knew not, and what to do themselves, they
knew not; for, first, the Enemy were too many; and,
secondly, they did not keep together, but were divided
into several Parties, and were on shore in several Places.
The Spaniards were in no small Consternation at this
Sight; and as they found, that the Fellows tan strag-
gling all over the Shore, they made no Doubt, but,
first or last, some of them would chop in upon their
^Habitation, or upon some other -Place, where they
would see the Tokens .of Inhabitants; and they were
in great Perplexity also for fear of their Flock of Goats,
which would have been little less than starving them,
if they mould have been destroyed; so the first Thing
.they resolved upon, was to dispatch thcee Men away,
before it was light, <uiz. two Spaniards and one .English-
man % to drive all the Goats away to the great Valley
where the Cave was, and, if Need wjere, to drive
them into the very Cave itself.
Could they have seen the Savages altogether in one
Body, and at any Distance from their Canoes, they re-
solved, if there had been an hundred of them, to have
attacked them; but that could not be obtained, for,
they were some of them two Miles off from the other,
.and, as it -appeared afterwards, were of two -different
Nations.
After having mused a great while on the Course
they should take, and .beaten their Brains in considering
their present Circumstances; they resolved at last, while
it was dark, to fend the old Savage (Friday's Father)
out, as a Spy, to learn, if possible, something concern-
ing them, as what they came for, and what they in-
tended to do, and the like \ the old Man readily zander-
took it, and, stripping himself quite naked, as most
of the Savages were, away he went: After he had been
gone an Hour or two, he .brings Word, that he "had been
among them undiscovered, that he found they were
two Parties, and of two several Nations, who had War
•y/ith one another, and had had a great Battle in their
own Country, and that both Sides having had several
Prisoners taken in the Fight, they were by mere
Chance landed in the fame Island, for ikz devouring
$heir Prisoners, and making merry; .but their coming
so by chance to the same Place, had spoiled all their
Mirth; that they were in a great Rage at one another,
and were so near, that he believed they would fight
again, as soon as Daylight began to appear; but he
did not perceive, that they had any Notion of any
^ody's being on the Island but themselves. He had hard-
ly made an End of telling the Story, when they could
perceive, by the unusual Noise they made, that the
two little Armies were engaged in a bloody Fight.
Friday's Father used all the Arguments he could to
persuade our People to lie close, and not be seen; he
told them, their Safety consisted in it, and that they had
nothing to do but to lie still, and the Savages would
kill one another to their Hands, and the rest would go
away; and it was so to a Tittle. But it was impossible
to prevail, especially upon the Englijhmen \ their Curio -
sity was so importunate upon their Prudentials, that
they must run out and fee the Battle: However, they
used some Caution, m. they did not go openly, just
by their own Dwelling, but went farther into the
Woods, and placed themselves to Advantage, where
they might securely see them manage the Fight, and, as
they thought, not to be seen by them; but, it seems, the
Savages did fee them, as we shall find hereafter.
The Battle was very fierce, and, if I might believe
the Englijhnien^ one of them said, he could perceive,
that some of them were Men of great Bravery, of invin-
cible Spirits, and of great Policy in guiding the Fight.
The Battle, they said, held two Hours, before they
could guess which Party would be beaten; but then
that Party which was nearest our People's Habitation,
began to appear weakest, and after some time more,
some of them began to fly; and this put our Men again
into a great Consternation, lest any of those that fled,
should run into the Grove, before their Dwelling, for
Shelte , and thereby involuntarily discover the Place;
and that by Consequence the Pursuers mould do the
like in Search for them. Upon this they resolved, that
they would stand armed within the Wall, and whoever
came into the Grove, they should sally out over the
Wall, and kill them; so that, if possible, not one mould
return to give an Account of it; they ordered also, that
\l should be done with their Swords, or by knocking
them down with the Stock of the Musquet, not by
shooting them, for sear os raising an Alarm by the Noise.
As they expected, it fell out; three of the routed
Army fled for Life, and, crossing the Creek, ran di-
rectly into the Place, not in the least knowing whither
they went, but running as into a thick Wood for Shel-
ter; the Scout they kept to look abroad, gave Notice of
this within, with this Addition, to our Mens great Sa-
tisfaction, viz. That the Conquerors had not pursued
them, or seen which Way they were gone. Upon this,
the Spaniard Governor, a Man of Humanity, would not
suifer them to kill the three Fugitives; but, sending three
Men out by the Top of the Hill, ordered them to go
round, and come in behind them, surprise and take them
Prisoners, which was done ; the Residue of the conquered
People fled to their Canoes, and got off to Sea; the
Victors retired, and made no Pursuit, or very little; but,
drawing themselves into a Body together, gave two great
screaming Shouts, which they supposed were by way of
Triumph, and so the Fight ended: And the same Day
about three o'Clock in the Afternoon, they also marched
to their Canoes. And thus the Spaniards had their Island
again free to themselves, their Fight was over, and they
saw no Savages in several Years after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their Den; and, viewing the Field of Battle they found
about two-and-thirty dead Men-upon the Spot; some
were killed with great long Arrows, several of which
were found sticking in their Bodies; but most of them
were killed with their great wooden Swords, sixteen or
seventeen of which they found in the Field of Battle,
and as many Bows, with a great many Arrows: These
Swords were great unwieldly Things, and they must be
very strong Men that used them: Most of those Men that
were killed with them, had their Heads masiVd to pieces,
as we may fay, or, as we call it in English, their Brains
knocked out, and several of their Arms and Legs broken;
so that 'tis evident they fight with inexpressible Rage and
Fury; they found not one wounded Man that was not
stone dead; for either they stay by their Enemy till they
ha^e quite killed them, or they carry all the wounded
Men, that are not quite dead, away with them.
This
Tips Deliverance tamed our EngHJfmten for a great
while; The Sight had filled them with Horror, and the
Consequences appeared terrible to the last Degree, espe-
cially upon supposing that some time or other they
should fall into the Hands of those Creatures, who
would not only kill them as Enemies, but kill them ibr
Pood, as we kill our Cattle. And they professed to me,
that the Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef or Mut-
ton, though it was supposed it was not to be till they
were dead, had something in it so horrible, that it nau-
seated their very Stomachs, made them sick when they
thought of it, and silled their Minds with unusual Terror,
that they were not themselves for some Weeks after.
This as I said, tam'd even the three English Brutes 1
have been speaking of; and for a great while after, they
were very tractable, and went about the common Busi-
ness of the whole Society well enough ; planted, fow'd,
reap'd, and began to be all naturalized to the Country •
but some time after this, they fell all into such simple
Measures again as brought them into a great deal of
Trouble.
They had taken three Prisoners, as I had observed g
and these three being lusty stout young Fellows, they
jnade them Servants, and taught them to work for
them; and, as Slaves, they did well enough; but,
they did not take tlieir Measures with them, as I did
by my Man Friday, <viz. to begin with them upon the
Principle of having saved their Lives, and then instruct
them in the rational Principles of Life, much less of
tReligion, civilizing and reducing them by kind Usage^
and affectionate Arguings; but, as they gave them their
JPood every Day, so they gave them their Work too, an<jl
kept them fully employed in Drudgery enough; but,
they failed in this, by it, that they never had them to
assist them and fight for them, as I had my Man Friday,
*^ho was as true to me as the very Flesh upon my Bones.
But to come to the Family Part; being all now good
Sriends (for common Danger, as I laid above, had ef-
fectually reconciled them) they began to consider their
general Circumstances; and the first Thing that came
#inder their Consideration was, whether, seeing the
Ravages particularly haunted that Side of the Island,
i and
and that there were more remote and retired Parts o€
it equally adapted to their way of Living, and mani-
festly to their Advantage, they should not rather remove
their Habitation, and plant in some more proper Place
for their Safety, and especially for the Security of their
Cattle and Com?
Upon this, after long Debate, it was conceived*
that they would not remove their Habitation; because
that some time or other they thought they might hear
from their Governor again, meaning me; and if I
should send any one to seek them, I would be sure to*
direct them on that Side, where, if they mould find
the Place demolished, they would conclude the Savages
had killed us all, and we were gone, and so our Supply
would go away too.
But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to' re-
move them into the Valley where my Cave was, where
the Land was as proper to both, and where indeed there
was Land enough: However, upon second Thoughts,
they altered one Part of that Resolution too, and re-
solved only to remove Part of their Cattle thither, ancE
plant Part of their Corn there; and so, if one Part was
destroyed, the other might be saved: And one Piece of
Prudence they uled, which it was very well they did;
<viz. That they never trusted these three Savages, which
they had taken Prisoners, with knowing any thing of
the Plantation they had made in that Valley, or of any
Cattle they had there; much less of the Cave there*
which they kept in cafe of Necessity, as a safe. Retreat j,
and thither they carried also the two Barrels of Powder,
which I had sent them at my coming away^
But, however, they resolved not to change their Habi-
tation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully co>
ver'd it first with a Wall or Fortification, and then witfe
a Grove of Trees; so, seeing their Safety consisted in*
tirely in their being concealed, of which they were now
fully convinced; they set to work to cover and conceal
the Place yet more effectually than before: To this Pur-
pose, as i had planted Trees (or rather thrust in Stakes*
which in^ time all grew to be Trees) for some good
Distance before the Entrance into my Apartment, they
went on in the same Manner, and filled up the rest of
that
that whole Space os Ground, from the Trees I had set/
quite down to the Side of the Creek, where, as I said, I
landed my Floats, and even into the very Ouze where
the Tide flowed, not so much as leaving any Place to
land, or any Sign that there had been any Landing
thereabout: These Stakes also, being of a Wood very
forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took
care to have generally very much larger and taller than
those which I had planted, and placed them so very thick
and close, that when they had been three or four Years
grown, there was no piercing with the Eye any consider-
able Way into the Plantation: As for that Part which I
had planted; the Trees were grown as thick as a Man's
Thigh; and among them they placed so many other
short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like
a Palisado a Quarter of a Mile thick> and it was next
to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little Army, to
cut it all down; for a little Dog could hardly get be-
tween the Trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the fame by all
the Ground to the Right-hand, and to the Left, and
round even to the Top of the Hill 3 leaving no Way,
not so much as for themselves to come out, but by the
Ladder placed up to the Side of the Hill, and then
lifted up, and placed again from the first Stage up to
the Top j which Ladder, when it was taken down, no-
thing but what had Wings or Witchcraft to assist it, could
come at them.
This was excellently well contrived: Nor was it less
than what they afterwards found Occasion for; which
served to convince me, that as human Prudence has
Authority of Providence to justify it, so it has, doubt-
less, the Direction of Providence to set it to work; and,*
would we listen carefully to the Voice of it, I am fully
persuaded we might prevent many of the Disasters-
which our Lives are now by our own Negligence sub-
jected to. But this by the way.
I return to the Story: They lived two Years after
this in perfect Retirement, and had no more Visits from
the Savages; they had indeed, an Alarm given them
one Morning, which put them in a great Consterna-
tion; for, some of the Spd?iiards being, out eariy one
Morning on the West-fide, or rather End of the Island,
which.
Which, by the way, was that End where I never went*
for fear of being discovered, they were surprised with
seeing above twenty Canoes of Indians, just coming on
ihore.
They made the best of their Way home, in Hurry
enough; and giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they
kept close all that Day and the next, going out only at
Night, to make Observation: But they had the good
Luck to be mistakeh; for where-ever the Savages
went, they did not land at that Time on the Island, but
pursued some other Design.
And now they had another Broil with the three Eng-
HJhmen; one of which, a most turbulent Fellow, being
in a Rage at one of the three Slaves, which I mentioned
they had taken, because the Fellow had not done some-
thing right which he bid him do, and seemed a little
ttntractable in his shewing him, drew a Hatchet out of a
Frog-belt, in which he wore it by his Side, and fell upon
the poor Savage, not to correct hiin, but to kill him.
One of the Spaniards, Who Was by, seeing him give the
Fellow a barbarous Cut with the Hatchet, which he
aimed at his Head, but struck into his Shoulder, so that
he thought he had cut the poor Creature's Arm off, ran
to him, and, intreating him riot to murder the poor Man,
clapt in between him and the Savage, to prevent the
Mischief.
The Fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his Hatchet, and swore he would
serve him as he intended to serve the Savage; which
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the Blow, and with a
Shovel, which he had in his Hand (for they were
working in the Field about their Corn-land,) knocked
the Brute down: Another of the Englishmen, funning at
the fame time to help his Comrade, knocked the Spa*
tiiard down; and then two Spaniards more came to help
their Man, and a third Englishman fell upon them*
They had none of them any Fire-arms, or any other
Weapons but Hatchets and other Tools, except this
third Englishman; he had one of my old rusty Cutlaces;
with which he made at the last Spaniards, and wounded
them both: This Fray set the Whole^raily in an Up-
roar, and more Help coming in, trnsy took the three
Englishmen Prisoners, The next Question Was, What
Vol, IL H mould
mould be done with them? They had been so often
mutinous, and were so furious, so desperate, and so
idle withal, that they knew not what Course to take
with them; for they were mischievous to the highest
Degree, and valued not what Hurt they did any Man;
so that, in short, it was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was Governor, told them in so
many Words, that if they had been his own Country-
men, he would have hanged them all; for all Laws,
and all Governors, were to preserve Society; and those
who were dangerous to the Society, ought to be ex-
pelled out of it; but, as they were Englishmen, and that
it was to the generous Kindness of an Englishman that they
all owed their Preservation and Deliverance, he would
use them with all possible Lenity, and would leave them
to the Judgment of the other two Englishment who were
their Countrymen.
One of the two honest E?iglishmen stood up, and said,
They desired it might not be left to them ,* For, says he,
/ am sure, <we ought to sentence them to the Gallonvs; and
with that gives an Account, how William Atkins, one of
the three, had proposed to have all the five Englijhmen
join together, and murder all the Spaniards, when they
were in their Sleep.
When the Spanish Governor heard this, he calls to
Will. Atkins: How, Seignior Atkins, fays he, Will you
murder us all? What ha<ve you to fay to that? That
hardened Villain was so far from denying it, that he
said, it was true, and G—d d—mn him they would
do it still before they had done with them. Well, but,
Seignior Atkins, said the Spaniard, What have we done
to you, that you will kill us? And what would you
get by killing us? And what must we do to prevent
your killing us ? Must we kill you, or will you kill us?
Why will you put us to the Necessity of this, Seignior
Atkins P Says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a Rage at the Spaniardss
making a Jest of it, that, had he not been held by
three Men, and withal had no Weapons with him, it
was thought he would have attempted to have killed
the Spaniard in the Middle of all the Company.
This hare-brainTd Carriage obliged them to consider
seriously what was to be done. The two Englishmen
&nd the Spaniard, who sav'd the poor Savage, was of
the Opinion, That they Jhould hang one of the three for an
Example to the rest; and that particularly it Jhould he he that
had twice attempted to commit Murder with his Hatchet i
and indeed these was some Reason to believe he had
done it, for the poor Savage was in such a miserable
Condition with the Wound he had received, that it wa«
thought, he could not live.
But the Governor Spaniard still said $ No, it was an
Englishman that had saved all their Lives, and he would
never consent to put an Englishman to Death, thoy he had
murder d half of them: nay, he said, if he had been kilsd
himself by an Englishman, and had Time lest to speaks 4t
should be, that they Jhould pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the Governor
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it: And as mer-
ciful Councils are most apt to prevail, where they are
so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but then
it was to be considered, what should be done to keep
them from the Mischief they designed; for all agreed,
Governor and all, That Means were to be used for pre-
serving the Society from Danger: After a long Debate it was
agreed, First, That they Jhould be disarm d, and not permitted
to have either Gun, or Powder, or Shot, or Sword, or any
Weapon, and should be turned out of the Society, and kfi ta
live where they would, and how they could, by themselves;
but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should
converse with them, speak with them, or have any thing to da
with them; that they Jhould be forbid to come within a certain
Distance of the Place vjhere the rest dwelt; and that if they
offered to commit any Disorder, Jo as to Jpoil, burn, hill, or
destroy any of the Corn, Plantings, Buildings ^Fences, or Cattle
belonging to the Society, that they Jhould die without Mercy,
and they Jhould Jhoot them where-ever they could find them.
The Governor, a Man of great Humanity, muling
upon the Sentence, considered a little upon it; and, turn-
ing to the two honest Engli/hmen, said, Hold -r you must
refleel, that it will be long ere they can raise. Corn and
Cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we must
therefore allow them Provisions, So he caus'd to be add-
ed, That they should have a Proportion of Corn given them
to last them eight Mantbs^ and for 8&d so Jow^ by which
Hz Tim
'lime they might he supposed to raise fime of their own; that
they should have six Milch-goats, four He-goats, and six Kids
given them, as well for present Subsistence, as for a Store;
and that they Jhould have Tools given them for their Work in
the Fields; such as, six Hatchets, an j4x, a Saw, and the
like: But they should have none of these Tools or Provisions
unless they vjould swear solemnly, That they would not hurt
or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their
Fellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissal them the Society, and turnM 'em
put to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and
refractory, as neither contented to go away, or to stay;
but, as there was no Remedy, they went pretending to
go and chuse, a Place where they should settle themselves,
to plant, and live by themselves; and some Provisions
were given them, but no Weapons.
About four or five Days after, they came again for some
Victuals, and gave the Governor an Account where they
had pitch'd their Tents, and marked themselves out an
Habitation or. Plantation; it was a very convenient Place
indeed, on the remotest Part of the Island, N. E, much
about the Place where I providentially landed in my first
Voyage, when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord alone
knows whither, in my foolish Attempt, to surround the
Island.
Here they built themselves two handsome Huts, and
contriv'd them in a Manner like my first Habitation,
being close under the Side of an Hill, having some Trees
growing already on the three Sides of it, so that by plant-
ing others, it would be very easily cover'd from the Sight,
unless narrowly searched for; they desired some dry Goat-
ikins for Beds and Covering, which were given them;
and, upon their giving their Words, that they would not
disturb the rest, or injure any of their Plantations, they
gave them Hatchets, and what other Tools they could
spare; some Peas, Barley, and Rice, for sowing, and,
in a word, any thing they wanted, but Arms and Am-
munition.
They HVd in this separate Condition about six Months,
and had gotten in their first Harvest, tho' the Quantity
was but small, the Parcel of Land they had planted be-
ing but little; for indeed, having all their Plantation to
form, they had a great deal of Work upon their Hands;
and when they came to make Boards, and Pots, and
such
such Things, they were quite out of their Element, and
could make nothing of it; and when the rainy Season
came on, for want of a Cave in the Earth, they could
not keep their Grain dry, and it was in great; Danger
pf spoiling: And this humbled them much; so they
came and begg'd the Spaniards to help them, which,
they very readily did; and in four Days work'd a great
Hole in the Side of the Hill for them, big enough to
secure their Corn, and other Things, from the Rain;
but it was but a poor Place, at best, compared to mine;
and especially as mine was then ; for the Spaniards had
greatly enlarged it, and made several new Apartments
in it.
About three Quarters of a Year after this Separation,
a new frolick took these Rogues, which, together with
the former Villainy they had committed, brought Mis-
chief enough upon them, and had very near been the
Ruin of all the whole Colony: The three new Sociates
began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious Life the/
led, and that without Hope of bettering their Circum-
stances; and a Whim took them, that they would
make a Voyage to the Continent, from whence the
Savages came, and would try if they could not seize
upon some Prisoners among the Natives there, and
bring them home, so as to make them do the laborious
Part of their Work for them.
The Project was not so preposterous, if they had gone
no farther; but they did nothing, and propos'd nothing,,
but had either Mischief in the Design, or Mischief in
the Event: And, if I may give my Opinion, they seem'd
to be under a Blast from Heaven; for if we will not
allow a visible Curse to pursue visible Crimes, how
shall we reconcile the Events of Things with the Divide
Justice? It was certainly an apparent Vengeance on
their Crime of Mutiny and Piracy, that brought 'em
to the State they were in; and as they lhew'd not the
least Remorse for the Crime, but added new Villainies
to it, such as, particularly, that Piece of monstrous
Cruelty of wounding a poor Slave, because he did not,
or perhaps could not understand to do, what he was
directed; and to wound him in such a Manner, as, no
question, made him a Cripple all his Life; and in a Place
Where no Surgeon or Medicine could be had for his
Cure i
Cure j and, what was still worse, the murderocs In-
tent; or, to do Justice to the Crime, the intentional
Murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards
the formed Design they alj laid, to murder the Spani-
ards in cold Blood, and in their Sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the Story: Th*
three Fellows came down to the Spaniards one Morning,
and in very humble Terms, desired to be admitted to
speak with them: The Spaniards very readily heard what
they had to say, which was this; That they were tired
of living in the Manner they did; that they were not
handy enough to make the Necessaries they wanted; and
that, having no Help, they found they should be starv'd;
But if the Spaniards would give them Leave to take one
of the Canoes which they came over in, and give them
Arms and Ammunition, proportioned for their Defence,
they would go over to the Main, and seek their Fortune,
and so deliver them from the Trouble os supplying them
with any other Provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them, but
yet very honestly represented to them the certain De-
struction they were running into; told them, they had
suffered such Hardships epon that very Spot, that they
could, without any Spirit of Prophecy, tell them, that
they would be starv'd, or murder'd ; and bad them con-
sider of it.
The Men reply'd audaciously, they ihould be starv'd,
if they stay'd here 5 for they could not work, and
would not work; and they could but be starv'd abroad;
and if they were murder'd, there was an End of them,
they had no Wives or Children to cry after them; and,
in siSort, insisted importunately upon their Demand,
declaring that they would go, whether they would
give them any Arms or no.
The Spaniards told them, with great Kindness, That
if they were refolv'd to go, they mould not go like naked
Men, and be in no Condition to defend themselves; and
that, tho* they could ill spare their Fire-Arms, having
not enough for themselves, yet they would let them have
two Musquets, a Pistol, and a Cutlace, and each Man
a Hatchet, which they thought was sufficient for them.
In a word, they accepted the Offer; and, having
feak'd then> Bread enough to serve them a Month, and
given
given them as much Goats-flesh, as they could eat while
it was sweet, and a great Basket full os dry'd Grapes*
a Pot full of fresh Water, and a young Kid alive to kill,
they boldly set out in a Canoe for a Voyage over the
Sea, where it was at least 40 Miles broad.
The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have
very well carry'd fifteen or twenty Men; and therefore
was rather too big for them to manage: But as they
had a fair Breeze, and the Flood-tide with them, they
did well enough: They had made a Mast of a long Pole,
and a Sail of four large Goat-skins dry'd, which they
had sew1d or lac'd together; and away they went mer-
rily enough; the Spaniards calTd after them, Bon Veajq:
and no Man ever thought of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and
the two honest Englishmen who remain'd behind, how
quietly and comfortably they liv'd, now those three tur-
bulent fellows were gone; as for their ever coming again,
that was the remotest Thing from their Thoughts that
could be imagined; when behold, after 22 Days Absence,
one of the Englishmen, being abroad upon his Planting-
work, fees three strange Men coming towards him at a
Distance, two of them with Guns upon their Shoulders.
Away runs the Englistjman, as if he was bewitched,
and came frighted and amazed to the Governor Spani-
ard, and tells him they were all undone, for there were
Strangers landed upon the I Hand, he couid not tell who:
The Spaniard, pausing awhile, fays to him, How do you
mean, you cannot tell who P They are Savages to Be jure.
No, no, fays the Englijhnan, they are Men in Cloaths
with Arms: Nay then, fays the Spaniard, nvfjy are you
concerned P If they are not Savages, they must be Friends;
for there is no Christian Nation upon Earth but <wiH do us
Good or rather than Harm*
While they were debating thus, came the three Eng-
lijhmm, and standing without the Wood, which was
new-planted, halloo'd to them; they presently knew
their Voices, and so all the Wonder of that Kind ceas\l.
But now the Admiration was turn'd upon another Que-
stion, viz. What could be the Matter, and what mad$
them come back again.
It was not long before they brought the Men in; and
inquiring where they had been, and what they had
been
been doing? They gave them a full Account os theif
Voyage, in a few Words; <viz. That they reached the
Land in two Days, or something less; but, finding the
People alarmed at their coming, and preparing with
Bows and Arrows to fight them, they durst not go on
shore, but faiPd on to the Northward six or seven
Hours, till they came to a great Opening by which
they perceiv'd, that the Land they saw from our Island
was not the Main, but an Island; that entering that
Opening of the Sea, they saw another Island on the
Right-hand, North, and several more West; and, being
resolv'd to land somewhere, they put over to one of
the Islands which lay West, and went boldly on shore;
that they found the People were courteous and friendly
to them, and they gave them several Roots, and some
dry'd Fish, and appear'd very sociable j and the Women,
as well as the Men, were very forward to supply them
with any thing they could get for them to eat, and
brought it to them a great Way upon their Heads.
They continued here four Days, and inquir'd as well
as they could of them by Signs, what Nations were this
Way, and that Way; and were told of several fierce and
terrible People, that liv'd almost every Way: who, as
they made known by Signs to them, us'd to eat Men;
but as for themselves, they said that they never eat
Men or Women, except only such as they took in the
Wars; and then they own'd, that they made a great
Feast, and eat their Prisoners.
The Englishmen inquired, when they had a Feast of that
Kind; and they told them, two Moons ago, pointing
to the Moon, and then to two Fingers; and that their
great King had 200 Prisoners now, which he had taken
in his War; and they were feeding them to make them
fat for the next Feast. The Englijhmen seem'd mighty
desirous to fee those Prisoners ; but the others mistaking
them, thought they were desirous to have some of
them, to carry away for their own eating. So they
beckon'd to them, pointing to the Setting of the Sun,
and then to the Rising; which was to signify, that the
next Morning, at Sun-rising, they would bring some
for them; and accordingly, the next Morning, they
brought down five Women, and eleven Men; and gave
them to the Englishmen to carry with them on their
Voyage,
Voyage, just as we would bring so many Cows and
Oxen down to a Sea-port Town, to victual a Ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these Fellows were *t
home, their Stomachs turn'd at this Sight, and they did
not know what to do; to refuse the Prisoners, would
have been the highest Affront to the Savage Gentry that
offered them; and what to do with them, they knew not; 0
however, upon some Debate, they refolv'd to accept of
them; and in Return they gave the Savages that brought
them, one of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and
fix or seven of their Bullets, which, tho1 they did not
understand, they feem'd extremely pleas'd with: And
then, tying the poor Creatures Hands behind them, they,
(the People) dragged the Prisoners into the Boat for our
Men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon
as they had them, or else they that gave them this no-
ble Present, would certainly have expected, that they
mould have gone to work with them, have kilTd two or
three of them the next Morning, and perhaps^ have in-
vited the Donors to Dinner.
But, having taken their Leave with all,the Respects
and Thanks that couid well pass between People, where
on ejther Side they understood not one Word they could
fay, they put off with their Boat, and came back to-
wards the first Island, where, when they arrived, they
set eight of their Prisoners at Liberty, there being too
many of them for their Occasion.
In their Voyage they endeavour'd to have some Com-
munication with their Prisoners, but it was impossible
to make them understand any thing; nothing they could
fay to them, or give them, ©r do for -them, but was
lookM upon as going about to murder diem: They first
of all unbound them, but the poor Creatures scream'd
-at that, especially the Women, as if they had just felt
the Knife at their Throats; for they immediately con-
cluded they were unbound on purpose to -be kilFd.
If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the fame
thing; then they concluded, it was for fear they
should fink in Flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill: If
they look'd at one of them more particularly, the
Party presently concluded, it was to fee whether 'We
or-she was fattest and fittest to kill first; nay, after they
Vol. II. I hai
had brought them quite over, and began to use them
kindly, and treat them well, still they expected every
Day to make a Dinner or Supper for their new Masters.
When the three Wanderers had given this unaccount-
able History or Journal of their Voyage, the Spaniard
alk'd them, where their new Family was ? And, being
^ told that they had brought them on shore, and put them
into one of their Huts, and vyere come to beg some
Victuals for them; they (the Spaniards) and the other
two Englijhmen> that is to fay, the whole Colony, re-
solv'd to go all down to the Place, and see them, and
did so, and Friday's Father with them.
When they came into the Hut, there they sat all
bound 5 for when they had brought them on more, they
bound their Hands, that they might not take the Boat,
and make their Escape; there, 1 say, they sat, all of
them stark-naked: First, There were three Men, lusty
comely Fellows, well-fhap'd, strait and fair Limbs,
about 30 to 35 Years of Age, and five Women, where-
of two might be from 30 to 40, two more not above
24 or 25, and the fifth, a tall comely Maiden, about 16
or 17; The Women were well-favour d agreeable Per-
sons, both in Shape and Features, only tawny ; and two
of them, had they been perfect white, would have pas-
sed for handsome Women, even in London itself; having
very pleasant agreeable Countenances, and of a very
modest Behayiour, especially when they came after-
wards to be cloath'd, and dress'd, as they calPd it, tho'
that Dress was very indifferent, it must be confess'd; of
which hereafter.
The Sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth
to our Spaniards* who were (to give them a just Cha-
racter) Men of the best Behaviour, of the most calm
sedate Tempers, and perfect Good-humour that ever I
met with; and in particular, of the most Modesty, as
will presently appear: I say, the Sight was very un-
couth, to fee two naked Men and five naked Women,
all together bound, and in the most miserable Circum-
stances that human Nature could be supposed to be, <viz,
to be expecting every Moment to be dragged out, and
)iave their Brains knock'd out, and then to be eaten up
like a Calf that is Jull'd sor a Dainty. ^
The first Thing they did was to cause the old Indian*
Friday's Father, to go in, and fee first if he knew any of
them; and then, if he understood any of their Speech:
As soon as the old Man came in, he looked seriously at
them, but knew none of them; neither could any of
them understand a Word he said, or a Sign he could
make except one of the Women.
However this was enough to answer the End, which
was to satisfy them,- that the Men into whose Hands
they were fallen were Christians; that they abhorr'd
eating of Men or Women, and that they might be sure
they would not be killed : As soon as they were assured
of this, they discovered such a Joy, and by such aukward
and several ways, as is hard to describe; for it seems
they were of several Nations.
The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid,
in the next Place, to ask them if they were willing to
be Servants, and to work for the Men who had brought
them away, to save their Lives? At which they all fell
a dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this, and
another that, any thing that lay next, to carry on their
Shoulders, to intimate, that they were willing to work*
The Governor, who found, that the having Women
among them, would presently be attended with some
Inconveniency, and might occasion some Strife, and
perhaps Blood, asked the three Men, What they in-
tended to do with these Women, and how they in*
tended to use them; whether as Servants, or as Women t
One of the Englishmen answered very boldly and rea-
dily, that they would use them as both. To which the
Governor said, I am not going to restrain you from it;
you are your own Masters as to that: But this I think
is but just, for avoiding Disorders and Quarrels among
you; and I'desire it of you, for that Reason only, sw*.
That you will all engage, that if any of you take any
of these Women, as a Woman, or Wife, "he shall take
but one; and that, having taken one, none else sliould
touch her: for though we cannot marry any of you,
yet it is but reasonable, that while you stay here, the
Woman any of you takes, mould be maintained by the
Man that takes her, and mould be his Wife; I mean,
fays he> while he continues here; and that none else
ihould have any thing to do with her, All this appeared
I 2 so
so just, that every one agreed to it without any Diffi-
culty.
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, If they, de-
signed to take any of them? But every one answered,
ISf O: Some of them said, they had Wives in Spaing
and the others did not like Women that were not
Christians; and altogether declared, that they would
not touch one of them; which was an Instance of such
Virtue, as I have not met with in all my Travels: On
the other hand, to be short, the five Englishmen took
them every one a Wise, that is to fay,, a temporary
Wife; and so they set up a. new Form of Living; for
the Spaniards and Friday's Father, liv'd in; my old
Habitation, which they had enlarged exceedingly with-
in; the three Servants, which they had taken in the
late Battle of the Savages, lived with them; and these
carried on the main Part of the Colony, supplying all
the rest with Food, and assisting them in any thing as
they could, or as they found Necessity required.
But the Wonder of this Story was, how five such re-
fractory ill-matched Fellows should agree about these
Women, and that two os them Ihould not pitch upoa
the same Woman,, especially seeing two or three of them
were, without Comparison, more agreeable than the
others: But they took a good Way enough to prevent
quarreling among, themselves; for they set the five
Women by themselves in one of their Huts,, and they
went all into the other Hut, and drew Lots among
them, who should chuse first.
He that drew to chuse first, went away by himself to
the Hut where the poor naked Creatures were, and
fetched out her he chose; and it was worth observing,
that he that chose first, took her that was reckoned the.
homeliest, and the oldest of the five, which made Mirth
enough among the rest; and even the Spaniards laugh'd
«t it: But the Fellow considers better than any of them,,
that it was Application and Business that they were to
expect Assistance in, as much as any thing else; and
Ihe proved the best Wife in the Parcel.
When the poor Women saw themselves set in- a Row
thus, and fetched out one by one^ the Terrors of their
Condition returned upon them again, and they firmly
believed, that they were now going to be devoured -
Accord-
Accordingly, when the English Sailor came in, and
fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most lament-
able Cry, and hung abont her, and took their Leave of
her with such Agonies, and such Affection, as would
have grieved the hardest Heart in the World; nor was
it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them, that they
were not to be immediately murdered, till they fetch'd
the old Man, Fridays Father, who instantly let them
know, that the five Men, who had fetched them out
one by one, had chosen them for their Wives.
When they had done this, and the Fright the Wo-
men were in, was a little over, the Men went to work,
and the Spaniards came and helped them; and in a few-
Hours they had built them every one a new Hut or
Tent for their Lodging apart; Tor those they had al-
ready were crouded with their Tools, HouihokLstufF,
and Provisions: The three wicked ones had pitched
farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both
on the North-shore of the Island, so that they continued
separate as before: And thus my Island was peopled
in three Places, and, as I might fay, three Towns were
begun to be planted.
And here 'tis very well worth observing, that as it
often happens in the World (what the wife Ends of
God's Providence are in such a Disposition of Things,
I cannot fay) the two honest Fellows had the two
worst Wives; and the three Reprobates, that were
scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, aral
neither seem'd born to do themselves Good, or any one
eWe, had three clever, diligent, careful, and ingenions
Wives; not that the two first were ill Wives, as to
their Temper or Humour; for all the five were most
willing, quiet, passive, and subjected Creatures, rather
like Slaves than Wives; but my Meaning is, they
vvere not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious^ or
alike cleanly and neat.
Another Observation I must make, to the Honour
of a diligent Application on one hand, and to the Dis-
grace of a slothful, negligent, idle Temper, on the
other j that when I came to the Place, and viewed the
several Improvements, Planting, and Management of
the several little Colonies; the two Men had so far
outgone the three, that there was no Comparison;
they
they had indeed both os them as much Ground laid out
for Corn as they wanted 5 and the Reason was, because,
according to any Rule, Nature dictated, that it was to
no Purpose to sow more Corn than they wanted; but
the Difference ps the Cultivation, of the Planting, of
the Fences, and indeed every thing else, was easy to
be seen at first View.
The two Men had innumerable young Trees planted
about their Huts, that when you came to the Place,
nothing was to be seen but a Wood; and though they
had twice their Plantation demolished, once by their
own Countrymen, and once by the Enemy; as shall be
shewn in its Place; yet they had restored all again, and
every thing was flourishing and thriving about them;
they had Grapes planted in Order, and managed like a
Vineyard, though they had themselves never seen any
thing of that Kind; and by their good ordering their
Vines, their Grapes were as good again as any of the
others. They had also found themselves a Retreat in
the thickest Part of the Woods, where, though there
was not a natural Cave, as I had found, yet they made
one with incessant Labour of their Hands, and where,
when the Mischief which followed happened, they se-
cured their Wives and Children, so as they could never
be found; they having, by sticking innumerable Stakes
and Poles of the Wood, which, as I said, grew so easily,
made a Grove impassable, except in one Place, where
they climbed up to get over the outside Part; and then
went in by Ways of their own leaving.
As to the three Reprobates, as I justly call them, tho'
they were much civiliz'd by their new Settlement,
compared to what they were before, and were not so
quarrel so me, having not the same Opportunity; yet
one of the certain Companions of a profligate Mind
never left them, and that was their Idleness: It is true,
they planted Corn, and made Fences; but Solomon's
Words were never better verified than in them: I went
by the Vineyard of the Slothful, and it was ell overgrown
ivith Thorns; for when the Spaniards came to view
their Crop, thay could not fee it in some Places for
Weeds; the Hedge had several Gaps in it, where the
wild Goats had gotten in^ and eaten up the Corn; per-
haps, here-and-there a dead Buih was crammed in, to
flop them out for the present, but it was only sliuttiag
the Stable-door after the Steed was stollen: Whereas,
when they looked on the Colony of the other two,
there was the very Face of Industry and Success upon
all they did; there was not a Weed to be seen in all
their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges: And
they, on the other hand, verified Sahmons Words in ano-
ther Place : That the diligent Band tfiakes rich. For every
thing grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty Within and
without; they had more tame Cattle than the other,
more Utensils and Necessaries within Doors, and yet
more Pleasure and Diversion too.
It is true, the Wives of the three "Were very haridy
and cleanly within Doors; and, having learn'd the Eng-
lish Ways of dressing and cooking from one of the
other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a Cook's Mate
on board the Ship, they dressed their Husband's Victuals
very nicely and well; whereas the other <xmld not be
brought to understand it; but then the Husband, who,
as I laid, had been Cook's Mate, did it himself; but as
for the Husbands of the three Wives, they loitered
about, fetch'd Turtles eggs, and caught Fiih and Birds;
in a word, any thing but Labour; and they fared ac-
cordingly. The Diligent lived well and comfortably
and the Slothful lived hard and beggarly; and so I be-
lieve, generally speaking, it is all Over the World.
But now I come to a Scene, different from all that
had happened before, either to them or to' me 5 and
the Original of the Story was this.
. Early one Morning there came on shore five or fix
Canoes of Indians, or Savages, call them which you,
please; and there is no room to doubt, that they came
upon.the old Errand of feeding upon their Slaves: But
that Part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, iind <o
our Men too, that they did not concern themselves
about it, as I did; but, having been made sensible by
their Experiences, that their only Business was to lie
concealed, and that, if they were not seen by any of
the Savages, they would go off again quietly, when
their Business was done, having as yet not the least
Notion of there being any Inhabitants in the Island;
I fay, having been made sensible of this, they had no-
thing to do but to give Notice to ajtl the three Planta-
3 "tions
tions to keep .within Doors, and not to skew themselves;
only placing a Scout in a proper Place, to give Notice
when the Boats went off to Sea again.
This was without Doubt very right; but a Disaster
spoiled all these Measures, and made it known among
tlie Savages, that there were Inhabitants there; which
was, in the End, the Desolation os almost the whole
Colony: After the Canoes with the Savages were gone
off, the Spaniards peep1d abroad again, and some of
them had the Curiosity to go to the Place where they
had been, to see what they had been doing: Here, to
their great Surprise, they found three Savages left be-
hind, and lyiri^Rst asleep upon the Ground; it was
supposed they had either been so gorg'd with their in-
human Feast, that, like Beasts, they were asleep, and
would not stir when the others went, or they were
wandered into the Woods, and did not come back in
time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this Sight,
and perfectly at a Loss what to do: The Spaniard Go-
\rernor, as it happened, was with them, and his Advice
was asked; but he professed he knew not what to do;
as for Slaves, they had enough already; and as to killing
them, they were none of them inclined to that: The
Spaniard Governor told me they could not think of
shedding innocent Blood; for, as to them, the poor
Creatures had done no Wrong, invaded none of their
Property; and they thought they had no just Quarrel
against them, to take away their Lives.
And here I must, in Justice to these Spaniards, ob-
serve, that let all the Accounts of Spanish Cruelty in
Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met with
seventeen Men of any Nation whatsoever, in any foreign
Country, who were so universally modest, temperate*
virtuous, so very good-humour'd, and so courteous, as
these Spaniards; and, as to Cruelty, they had nothing
of it in their very Nature, no Inhumanity, no Barba-
rity, no outrageous Panions, and yet all of them Men
of great Courage and Spirit.
Their Temper and Calmness had appeared, in their
bearing the unsufferable Usage of the three Englishmen;
and their Justice and Humanity appeared now in the
Case of the Savages, as above: After some Consultation,
. . . they
they resolved upon this, that they would lie still awhile
longer, till, if possible, these three Men might be gone;
but then the Governor Spaniard recollected, that the three
Savages had no Boat; and that, if they were left to
rove about the Island, they would certainly discover,
that there were Inhabitants in it; and so they should be
undone that way.
Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the
Fellows fast: asleep still: So they resolved to awaken
them, and take them Prisoners, and they did so; the
poor Fellows were strangely frighted when they were
feiz'd upon and bound, and afraid, like the Women,
that they should be murdered and eaten; for, it seems,
those People think all the World do as they do, eating
Mens Flelh; but they were soon made easy as to that*
and away they carried them.
It was very happy to them, that they did not carry
them home to their Castle; I mean, to my Palace un-
der the Hill; but they carried them first to the Bower,
where was the chief of their Country-work; such as
the keeping the Goats, the planting the Corn, &c. and
afterwards they carried them to the Habitation of the
two Englijhmen.
Here they were set to work, tho' it was not much
they had for them to do: And, whether it was by Neg-
ligence in guarding them, or that they thought the
Fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, but
one of them ran away; and, taking into the Woods,
they could never hear of him more.
They had good Reason to believe he got home again
soon after, in some other Boats or Canoes of Savages,,
who came on shore three or four Weeks afterwards,
and who, carrying on their Revels as usual, went off
again in two Days time: This Thought terrified them
exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without
good Cause indeed, that if this Fellow got safe home
among his Comrades, he would certainly give them an
Account that there were People in the Island, as also how
weak and few they were; for this Savage, as I observ'd
before* had never been told, as it was very happy he
had not, how many they were, or where they liv'd;
nor had he ever seen or heard the Fire of any of their
Guns, much less had they shewn him any of their other
Vol. II. N<\ 16,' K retired
retired Places, such as the Cave in the Valley, or ther
new Retreat, which the two Englishmen had made,
and the like.
The first Testimony they had, that this Fellow had
given Intelligence of them, was, that about two Months-
after this, fix Canoes of Savages, with about seven or
eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, came rawing along the
North-fide of the Island, where they never used to
come before, and landed about an Hour after Sun-rise,
at a convenient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation
of the two Englijhmeny where this escaped Man had
been kept: As the Spaniard Governor said, Had they
been all there, the Damage would not have been so
much, for not a Man of them would have escaped: But
the £ase differed now very much; for two Men to
iisty were too much Odds: The two Men had the
Happiness to discover them about a League off, so that
it was above an Hour before they landed; and, as they
landed about a Mile from their Huts, it was some time
before they could come at them. Now having great
Reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first
Thing they did, was, to bind the Slaves which were left,
and cause two of the three Men, whom they brought
with the Women, who, it seems, proved very faithful to-
them, to lead them with their two Wives, and whatever
they could carry away with them, to their retired Place
in the Woods, which I have spoken of above, and there lo
bind the two Fellows Hand and Foot till they heard farther.
In the next place, seeing $e Savages were all come
on shore, and that they bent their Course directly that
Way, they open'd the Fences, where their Milch-goats
were kept, and drove them all out, leaving their Goats
to straggle into the Wood, whither they pleased, that the
Savages might think they were all bred wild; but the
Rogue who came with them was too cunning for that,
and gave them an Account of it ail; for they went di-
rectly to the Place.
When the two poor frighted Men had secured their
Wives and Goods, they lent the other Slave they had
of thg, threQ, who came with the Women, and who-
was at their Place by Accident, away to the Spaniards,
with all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and desire speedy
Help; and in the mean time they took their Arms*
and what Ammunition they had, and retreated towards
the Place in the Wood, where their Wives were sent,^
keeping at a Distance; yet so that they might see, if
possible, which Way the Savages took.
They had not gone far, but that, from a rising
Ground, they could fee the little Army of their Enemies
come on directly to their Habitation, and in a Moment
more could fee all their Huts and Houstiold-stufF flam-
ing up together, to their great Grief and Mortification;
for they had a very great Loss, and to them irretriev-
able, at kast for some time. They kept their Station
for awhile, till they found the Savages, like wild JBeasts,
spread themselves all over the Place, rumaging every
Way, and £very Place, they could think of, in search
for Prey; and, in particular, for the People, of whom it
now plainly appearM they had Intelligence.
The two E?igljjhmen, seeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, because, as it was likely
some of the wild People might come that Way, so they
might come too many -together, thought it proper to
make another Retreat about half a Mile farther, be-
lieving, as it afterwards happened, that the farther they
strolled, the fewer would be together.
The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very thick-
grown Part of the Woods, and where an old Trunk of
a Tree stood, whkh was hollow, and vastly large;
and in this Tree they both took their Standing, resolv-
ing to see there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of ,tjie Sa-
vages appear'd running directly that Way, as if they
had already Notice where they stood, and were
coming up to attack them; and a little Way farther, they
elpy'd three more coming after them, and five more be-
yond them, all coming the fame Way; besides which,
they saw seven or eight more at a Distance, running
another Way; for, in a word, they ran every Way,
dike Sportsmen beating for their Game.
The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whe-
ther they mould stand, and keep their Posture, or fly:
But after a very snort Debate with themselves, they
considered, that if the Savages ranged the Country thus,
before Help came, they might, perhaps, find out their
Retreat in the Woods, and then all would be lost; so
K 2 they
they resolved to stand them there; and if there were
too many to deal with, then they would get to the Top
of the Tree, from whence they doubted not to defend
themselves, Fire excepted^ as long as their Ammunition
lasted, though all the Savages that were landed, which
were near fifty, were to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered whe-
ther they should fire at the first two, or wait for the three,
and so take the middle Party; by which the two and the
five that followed would be separated; at length they
resolved to let the two first pass by, unless they mould
'spy them in the Tree, and come to attack them. The
two first Savages also confirmed them in this Resolution,
by turning a little from them towards another Part of the
Wood; but the three, and the five after them, came for-
wards directly to the Tree, as if they had known the
Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so strait towards them, they re-
solved to take them in a Line as they came; and as
they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first
Shot might hit them all three; to which Purpose, the
Man who was to fire, put three or four Bullets into his
Piece; and, having a fair Loop-hole, as it were, from a
broken Hole in the Tree, he took a sure Aim, without
being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty
Yards oif the Tree, so that he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the Savages came
on, they plainly saw, that one of the three was the
run-away Savage that had escaped from them, and they
both knew him distinctly, and resolved, that, if possible,
he should not escape, tho1 they mould both fire; so the
other stood ready with his Piece, that if he did not drop
at the first Shot, he should be sure to have a second.
• But the first was too good a Marksman to miss his
Aim; for, as the Savages kept near one another, a little
behind in a Line, in a word, he sired, and hit two of
them directly: The foremost was killed outright, being
shot in the Head; the second, which was the run-away
Indian, was shot thro' the Body, and fell, but was not
quite dead; and the third had a little Scratch in the
Shoulder, perhaps, by the fame Ball that went through
the Body of the second; and, being dreadfully frighted,
though not much hurt, sat down upon the Ground,
screaming and yelling in a hideous Manner. The
The five that were behind, more frighted with the
Noise, than sensible of their Danger, stood still at first;
for the Woods made the Sound a thousaad times bigger
than it realiy was; the Echoes rattling from one Side to
another, and the Fowls rising from all Parts, screaming
and making, every Sort, a several Kind of Noise, ac-
cording to their Kind, just as it was when I fired the
first Gun that, perhaps, was ever shot off in that Place,
since it was an Island.
However, all being silent again, and they not know-
ing what the Matter was, came on unconcerned, till
they came to that Place where their Companions lay,
in a Condition miserable enough: And here the poor
ignorant Creatures, not sensible that they were within
Reach of the same Mischief, stood all of a Huddle over
the wounded Man, talking, and, as may be supposed,
inquiring of him how he came to be hurt; and who *tis
very rational to believe, told them that a Flash of Fire
first, and immediately after that, Thunder from their
Gods, had killed those two, and wounded him: This, I
fay, is rational; for nothing is more certain than that, as
they saw no Man near them, so they had never heard a
Gun in all their Lives, or so much as heard of a Gun;
neither knew they any thing of killing or wounding at a
Distance, with Fire and Bullets; if they had, one might
reasonably believe, they would not have stood so un-
concerned, in viewing the Fate of their Fellows, with-
out some Apprehension of their own.
Our two Men, though, as they confessed to me, it
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor Crea-
tures, who at the fame time had no Notion of their
Danger; yet, having them ail thus in their Power, and
the first having loaded his Piece again, resolved to let
fly both together among them; and, singling out, by
Agreement, which to aim at, they mot together, and
killed or very much wounded four of them; the fifth,
frighted even to Death, though not hurt, fell with the
rest; so that our Men, seeing them all fall together,
thought they had killed them all.
The Belief that the Savages were all killed, made
pur two Men come boldly out from the Tree before
jthey had charged their Guns again, which was a wrong
Step; and t]iey were under some Surprise, when they
came
I
came to the Place, and found no less than four of the
Men alive, and of them, two very little hurt, and one"
not at all: This obliged them to fall upon them with
the Stocks of their Musquets; and first they made sure
of the run-away Savage, that had been the Cause of all
the Mischief,- and of another that was hurt in his Knee,
and put them out of their Pain; then the Man that was
not hurt at all came and kneeled down to them, with
his two Hands held up, and made piteous Moan to
them by Gestures and Signs, for his Life; but could not
fay one Word to them that they could understand.
However, they fign'd to him to sit down at the
Foot of a Tree thereby; and one of the Etiglijhmen,
with a Piece of Rope-twine, which he had by great
Chance, in his Pocket, ty'd his Feet fast together, and
his Hands behind him, and there they left him; and,
with what Speed they could, made after the other two,
which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of
them, should find the Way to their covered Place in the
Woods, where their Wives, and the few Goods they
had left lay: They came once in Sight of the two Men,
but it was at a great Distance; however, they had the
Satisfaction to fee them cross over a Valley, towards
the Sea, the quite contrary Way from that which led to
their Retreat, which they were afraid of; and, being
satisfied with that, they went back to the Tree, where
they left their Prisoner, who, as they supposed, was
delivered by his Comrades j for he was gone and the
two Pieces of Rope-yarn, with which they had bound
him, lay just at the Foot of the Tree.
They were now in as great a Concern, as before,
fiot knowing what Course to take, or how near the
Enemy might be, or in what Numbers; so they re-
solved to go away to the Place where their Wives were,
to fee if all was well there, and to make them easy,
who were in Frigh* enough to be sure; for though the
Savages were their own Country-folk, yet they were
?nost terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more,
for the Knowledge they had of them.
When they came thither, they found the Savages had
been in the Wood, and very near the Place; but had
not found it; for indeed, it was inaccessible, by the
Trees standing so thick, as before, unless the Persons
seeking
seeking it fiSIJIbeen directed by those that kræw it,
which these were not; they found, therefore, every
thing very safe, only the Women in a terrible Fright:
While they were here, they had the Comfort of seven
of the Spaniards coming to their Assistance; the other
ten, with their Servants, and old Friday, I mean Fri-
days Father, were gone in a Body to defend their Bower,
and the Corn and Cattle that were kept there, in cafe
the Savages should have roved over to that Side of
the Country; but they did not spread so far: With the
seven Spaniards came one of the Savages, who, as I
said, were their Prisoners formerly and with them
also came the Savage, whom X&^MgliJhmen had left
bound Hand and Foot at the Tree; for it seems they
came that Way, saw the Slaughter of the seven Men,
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them; where, however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as they had done the two others, who were
left when the third ran away.
The Prisoners began now to be a Burden to them;
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
thought they were under an absolute Necessity to kill
them for their own Preservation: However, the Spa-
niard Governor would not consent to it; but ordered,
that they should be sent out of the Way, to my old
Cave in the Valley, and be kept there with two Spa-
niards to guard them, and give them Food: Which
was done; and they were bound there Hand and Foot
for that Night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englijhmen were
so encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to
stay any longer there; but taking five of the Spaniards,
and themselves, with four Mufquets and a Pistol among
them, and two stout Quarter-staves, away they went in
Quest of the Savages: And first, they came to the Tre«
where the Men lay that had been killed; but it was
easy to see, that some more of the Savages had been
there; for they attempted to carry their dead Men
away, and had dragged two of them a good Way, but
had given it over: From thence they advanced to the
first rising Ground, where they had stood, and seen their
Camp destroyed, and where they had the Mortification
still to see some of the Smoke; but neither could they
here
hsre see any of the Savages: They then resolved,, thoug\
with all possible Caution, to go forward towards their
ruined Plantation; But a little before they came thi-
ther, coming in Sight of the Sea-more, they saw plainly
the Savages all embarking again in their Canoes, in
order to be gone.
They seemed {orry at first, that there was no way
to come at them, to give them a parting Blow: But,
opon the Whole, were very well satisfied to be rid of
them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruin'd, and
all their Improvements destroyed, the rest ail agreed to
come and help tStm to rebuild, and to assist them with
needful Supplies. Their three Countrymen, who were
not yet noted for having the least Inclination to do any
Good, yet, as soon as they heard of it (for they, living
remote Eastward, knew nothing of the Matter till all
was over) came and offered their Help and Assistance,
and did very friendly work for several Day?, to restore
their Habitations, and make Necessaries for them; and
thus in a little time, they were set upon their Legs
again.
About two Days after this, they had the farther Sa-
tisfaction of seeing three of the Savages Canoes come
driving on shore, and, at some Distance from them,
with two drowned Men; by which they had Reason
to believe, that they had met with a Storm ac Sea,
and had overset some of them for it had blown very
hard the Night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the other
hand, enough of them escaped to inform the rest, a5
well os what they had done, as of what happened to
them; and to whet them on to another Enterprise of
the same Nature, which they, it seems, resolved to at-
tempt, with sufficient Force to carry all before them;
for, except what the first Man had told them of Inha-
bitants, they could fay little to it of their own Know-
ledge; for they never saw one Man, and the Fellow be-
ing killed that had affirm'd it, they had no other Wit-
ness to confirm it to them.
It was five or fix Months after this, before they heard
any more of the Savages ,• in which time our Men
were in Hopes they had not forgot their former bad,
2 Luck,
Luck, or had given over the Hopes of better; when, on
a sudden, they were invaded with a most formidable
Fleet, of no less than zS Canoes full of Savages armed
with Bows and Arrows, great Clubs, wooden Swords,
and such like Engines of War; and they brought such
Numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our Peo-
ple into the utmost Consternation.
As they came on shore in the Evening, and at the
Eastermost-side of the island, our Men had that Night
to consult and consider what to do; and, in the first
place, knowing that their being intirely concealed, was
their only Safety before, and would much more be so
now, while the Number of their Enemies was so great,
they therefore resolved, first of all, to take down the
Huts which were built for the two Englijh?neny and drive
away their Goats to the old Cave; because they sup-
posed the Savages would go directly thither, as soon as
it was Day, to play the old Game over again, tho' they
did not now land within two Leagues of it.
In the next place, they drove away all the Flock of
Goats they had at the old Bower, as I called it, which
belonged to the Spaniards; and, in stiort, left as little
Appearance of Inhabitants any where as possible; and A
the next Morning early they posted themselves with all
their Force, at the Plantation of the two Men, wait-
ing for their coming. As they guessed, so it happened;
these new Invaders, leaving their Canoes at the East-end
of the Island, came ranging along the Shore directly
towards the Place, to the Number of 250, as near as
our Men could judge. Our Army was but small in-
deed; but, that which was worse, they had not Arms
for all their Number neither: The whole Account, it
seems, stood thus: First, as to Men;
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old Friday, or Fridafs Father.
3 Slaves, taken with the Women, who proved
very faithful.
% Other Slaves who lived with the Spaniards.
Vol. It
L
To
To arm these they had
I1 Musquets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling-pieces.
5 Musquets, or Fowling-pieces, which were taken
by me from the mutinous Seamen whom 1
reduced,
z Swords.
3 Old Halberts.
To their Slaves they did not give either Mtrfquet or
Fusil, but they had every one an Ha.lberty or a long
Staff, like a Quarter-staff, with a great Spike of Iron
fastened into eacli End of it, and by his Side a Hatchet ^
also every one of oar Men had Hatchets. Two of the
Women could not be prevailed upon, but they would
come into the Fight; and they had Bows and Arrows,
which the Spaniards had taken from the Savages, when
the first Action happened, which 1 have spoken of,
where the Indinm fought with one another, and the
Women had Hatchets too.
The Spaniard Governor, whom I have described so
often, commanded the whole; and William Atkivsr
who, though a dreadful Fellow for Wickedness, was a
most daring bold Fellow, commanded under him. The
Savages came forwards like Lions, and our Men, which
was the worst of their Fate, had no Advantage in their
Situation; only that Will. Atkins, who now proved a
most useful Fellow, with fix Men, was planted just be-
hind a small Thicket of Buihes, as an advanced Guard,
with Orders to let the first of them pass by, and then
fire into the Middle of them j and, as soon as he had
fired, to make his Retreat, as nimbly as he could,
round a Par! of the Wood, and so come in behind the
Spaniards where they stood, having a Thicket of Trees
all before them.
When the Savages came on, they ran straggling
about every Way in Heaps, out of all manner of Order;
and Will. Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him;
then, feeing the rest come in a very thick Throng, lie
orders three of his Men to hre, having loaded their Mus-
quets
qoets with 6 or 7 Bullets apiece, about as big as large
Pistol-bullets. How many they killed or wounded,
they knew not; but the Consternation and Surprise
was inexpressible among the Savages, who were frighted
to the last Degree, to hear such a dreadful Noise, and
see their Men killed, and others hurt, but fee nobody
that did it; when, in the Middle of their Fright,
William Atkins, and his other three, let fly again among
the thickest of them; and in less than a Minute, the
first three, being loaded again, gave them a third Volley.
Had William Atkins and his Men retir'd immediately,
æs soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do;
or had the rest of the Body been at hand, to have pour'd
in their Shot continually, the Savages had been effectually
routed; for the Terror that was among them came
principally from this, <vi%. That they were killed by the
Gods nvith Thunder and Lightning, and oould fee nobody
that hurt them; but William Atkins, staying to load
again, discovered the Cheat: Some of the Savages, who
were at a Distance, spying them, came upon them be-
hind; and tho' Atkins and his Men fired at them also,
two or three times, and killed above twenty, retiring
as fast as they could, yet they wounded Atkins himself,
and killed one of his Fellow Englishmen with their Ar-
rows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of
the Indian Slaves who came with the Women; this
Slave was a most gallant Fellow, and fought most des-
perately, killing five of them with his own Hand,
having no Weapon but one of the armed Staves, and,
as Hatchet.
Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded
and two other Men killed, retreated to a rising Ground
in the Wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three Vol-
lies upon them, retreated also; for their Number was
so great, and they were so desperate, that tho1 above 50
os them were killed, and more than so many wounded,
yet they came on in the Teeth of our Men, fearless of
Danger, and shot their Arrows like a Cloud; and it was
observed, that their wounded Men, who were not quite
disabled, were made outrageous by their Wounds, and
fought like Madmen.
When our Men retreated, they left the Spaniard and
the Englishman that were killed, behind them; and the
L 3 Sayages
Savages, when they came up to them, kill'd them over
again in a wretched Manner, breaking their Arms,
Legs and Heads, with their Clubs, and wooden Swords,
like true Savages: But, finding our Men were gone,
they did not seem to pursue them, but drew themselves
up in a kind of a Ring, which is, it seems, their
Custom; and shouted twice, in Token of their Victory:
After which, they had the Mortification to fee several
of their wounded Men fall, dying with the mere Loss
of Blood.
The Spaniard Governor having drawn his little Body
up together upon a rising Ground, Atkins, though he
was wounded, would have had him march'd, and charg'd
them again all together at once: But the Spaniard- re-
ply'd, Seignior Atkins, You fee how their wounded
Men right; let them alone till Morning; all these
wounded Men will be stiff and sore with their Wounds,
and faint with the Loss of Blood; and so we shall have
the fewer to engage.
The Advice was good ; But Will, Atkins reply'd mer-
rily, That's true, Seignior, and so shall I too; and that's
the Reason I would go on, while I am warm. Well,
Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard, you have behaved
gallantly, and done your Part; we will fight for you,
if you cannot come on; but I think it best to stay till
Morning; so they waited.
But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they
found tjie Savages in great Disorder about their dead and
wounded Men, and a great Hurry and Noise among them
where they lay, they afterwards resolv'd to fall* upon
them in the Night, especially if they could come to gfve
'em but one Volley before they were discovered. Thjs
they had a fair Opportunity to do; for one of the two
Englishmen, in whose Quarter it was where the Fight
began, led 'em round, between the Woods and the Sea-
side, Westward, and turning short South, they came so
near where the thickest of'em lay, that before they were
seen or heard, eight of 'em fir'd in among 'em, and did
dreadful Execution upon 'em; in half a Minute more,
eight others fir'd after them, pouring in their small Shot
in such a Quantity, that abundance were killed and
wounded; and all this while they were not able to fee
who hurt 'em, or which Way to fly.
The Spaniards charg'd again with the utmost Expedi-
tion, and then divided themselves into three Bodies, and
resolved to fall in among 'em all together: They had in
.each Body eight Persons, that is to fay 24, whereof
were 22 Men, and the two Women, who by the way,
fought desperately.
They divided the Fire-arms equally in each Party,
and so of the Halberts and Staves. They would have
had the Women keep back; but they said, they were
resolved to die with their Husbands. Having thus form'd
their little Army, they march'd out from among the
Trees, and came up to the Teeth of the Enemy, lhout-
}ng and hallooing as loud as they could; the Savages
flood all together, but were in the utmost Confusion,
hearing the Noise of our Men shouting from three
Quarters together; they would have fought, if they
had seen us: And as soon as we came near enough to
be seen, some Arrows were shot, and poor old Friday
was wounded, tho1 not dangerously. But our Men gave
them no Time; but, running up to 'em, hYd among
'em three Ways; and then fell in with the But-ends of
their Mufquets, their Swords, arm'd Staves, and Hat-
chets; and laid about them so well, that, in a word,
they set up a dismal Screaming and Howling, flying to
save their Lives which Way soever they could.
Our Men were tir'd with the Execution; and kill'd,
or mortally wounded, in the two Fights, about 180 of
them; the rest, being frighted out of their Wits, scour'd
thro' the Woods, and over the Hills, with all the Speed
and Fear that nimble Feet could help them to do; and
as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them,
they got all together to the Sea-fide, where they landed,
and where their Canoes lay. But their Disaster was not
at an End yet; for it blew a terrible Storm of Wind
that Evening from the Sea-ward; so that it was impos-
sible for them to put off; nay, the Storm continuing "all
Night, when the Tide came up, their Canoes were
most of them driven by the Surge of the Sea so high
upon the Shore, that it requir'd infinite Toil to get them
off; and some of them were even dasiYd to pieces against
the Beach, or against one another.
Our Men, tho' glad of their Victory, yet got little Rest
jhat Night; but having refresiYd themselves as well as
thev
they could, they resolv'd to march to that Part of the
Island where the Savages were fled, and fee what
Posture they were in. This necessarily led them over
the Place where the Fight had been, and where they
found several of the poor Creatures not quite dead, and
yet past recovering Life; a Sight disagreeable enough
to generous Minds; for a truly great Man, tho* oblig'd
by the Law of Battle to destroy his Enemy, takes no
Delight in his Misery.
However, there was no need to give any Order in this
Cafe; for their own Savages, who were their Servants,
dispatched those poor Creatures with their Hatchets.
At length they came in View of the Place where the
more miserable Remains of the Savages Army lay,
where there appeared about 100 still; their Posture was
generally fitting upon the Ground, with their Knees up
towards their Mouth, and the Head put between the
Hands, leaning down upon the Knees.
When our Men came within two Mufquet-fhot of
them, the Spaniard Governor ordered two Mufquets to
be firM without Ball, to alarm them; this he did, that
by their Countenance he might know what to expect,
Whether they were still in Heart to light, or were
ib heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and discouraged,
and so he might manage accordingly.
This Stratagem took for, as soon as the Savages
heard the first Gun, and saw the Flash os the second,
they started up upon their Feet in the greatest Conster-
nation imaginable; and as our Men advanced swiftly
towards them, they all ran screaming and yawling away,
with a kind of an howling Noise, which our Men did
not understand, and had never heard before; and thus
they ran up the Hills into the Country.
At first, our Men had much rather the Weather had
been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea: But
they did not then consider, that this might probably have
been the Occasion of their coming again in such Multi-
tudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many
and so often, as would quite desolate the Island, and
starve them: Will: Atkins therefore, who, notwithstand-
ing his Wound, kept always with them, proved the lA
Counsellor in this Cafe: His Advice was, to take^
Advantage that offered, and clap in between them J
their Boats, and so deprive them of the Capacity of
ever returning any more to plague the Island.
They consulted long about this, and some were against
it, for fear of making the Wretches sly to the Woods,
and live there desperate; and so they should have them
to hunt like wild Beasts, be afraid to stir about their
Business, and have their Plantation continually rifled,
all their tame Goats destroyed, and, in short be reduced
to a Life of continual Distress.
Will. Atkins told them, They had better have to do-
with 100 Men, than with a 100 Nations: That as they
must destroy their Boats, so they must destroy the Men,
or be all of them destroyed themselves. In a word,
he sliew1d them the Necessity of it so plainly, that they
all came into it; so they went to work immediately
with the Boats, and, getting some dry Wood together
from a dead Tree, they try'd to set some of them on
Fire; but they were so wet, that they would not burn.
However, the Fire so burn'd the upper Part, that it
foon made them unfit for swimming in the Sea as Boats-
When the Indians saw what they were about, some of
them came running out of the Woods: and, coming as
near as they could to our Men, kneel'd down and cry'd,
Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and some other Words of their
Language, which none of the others* understood any
thing of; but as they made pitiful Gestures, and strange
Noises, it was easy to understand, they begged to have
their Boats spar'd, and that they would be gone, and
never come thither again.
But our Men were now satisfied, that they had no
way to preserve themselves, or to save their Colony, but
effectually to prevent any of these People from ever
going home again; depending upon this, that if ever
so much as one of them got back into their Country
to tell the Story, the Colony was undone: So that, let-
ting them know, that they should not have any Mercy,
they fell to work with their Canoes, and destroyed them
every one, that the Storm had not destroyed before; at
the Sight of which the Savages rais'd a hideous Cry in
the Woods, which our People heard plain enough;
after which they ran about the Island like distracted
Men ; so that, in a word, our Men did not really know
at first what to do with them.
* 3 Nor
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their Prudence, con-
sider, that while they made those People thus desperate,
they ought to have kept good Guard at the same time
upon their Plantations; for tho' it is true, they had
driven away their Cattle, and the Indians did not find
their main Retreat, I mean my old Castle at the Hill,
nor the Cave in the Valley; yet they found out my
Plantation at the Bower, and pull'd it all to pieces, and
all the Fences and Planting about it? trod all the Corn
under Foot; tore up the Vines and Grapes, being just
then almost ripe; and did our Men an inestimable
Damage, tho* to themselves not ons Farthing's worth
of Service.
Tho1 our Men were able to fight them upon all Oc-
casions, yet they were in no Condition to pursue them>
or hunt them up and down; for as they were too nimble
of Foot for our Men, v/hen they found them single*
so our Men durst not go about single, for fear of being
surrounded with their Numbers: The best was, they
had no Weapons; for tho' they had Bows, they had na
Arrows left, nor any Materials to make any, nor had
they any edg'd Tool or Weapon among them.
The Extremity and Distress they were reduced to was
great, and indeed deplorable, but at the fame time our
Men were also brought to very hard Circumstances by
them; for tho1 their Retreats were preserved, yet their
Provision was destroyed, and their Harvest spoiled; and
what to do, or which Way to turn themselves, they
knew not: The only Refuge they had now, was the
Stock of Cattle they had in the Valley by the Cave, and
some little Corn which grew there. The three English-
men r William Atkins, and his Comrades, were now re-
due'd to two, one of them being killed by an Arrow
which struck him on the Side of his Head, just under
the Temples, so that he never spoke more; and it was
ver;'- remarkable, that this was the fame barbarous Fellow
who cut the poor Savage Slave with his Hatchet, and who
afterwards intended to have murder'd the Spaniards,
I look'd upon their Cafe to have been worse at this
time, than mine was at any time, after I first discover'd
the Grains of Barley and Rice, and got into the Method
of planting and railing rny Corn, and my tame Cattle j
for now they had, as I may fay, a hundred Wolves upon
the
the Island, which would devour every thing they could
come at, yet could be very hardly come at themselves.
The first thing they concluded, when they saw what
their Circumstances were, was, that they would, if pos-
sible, drive them up to the farther Part of the Island,
South-east, that if any more Savages came on shore,
they might not find one another; then, that they would
daily hunt and harrass them, and kill as many of them
as they could come at, till they had reduced their Num-
ber; and if they could at last tame them, and bring
them to any thing, they would give them Corn, and
teach them how to plant and live upon their daily La-
bour.
In order to this, they so followed them, and so ter-
rified them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if any
of them fired a Gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him,
yet he would fall down for Fear; and so dreadfully
frighted they were, that they kept out of Sight farther
and farther, till at last our Men following them, and
every Day almost killing and wounding some of them,
they kept up in the Woods and hollow Places so much,
that it reduced them to the utmost Misery for want of
Food; and many were afterwards found dead in the
Woods, without any Hurt, but merely starved to Death,
When our Men found this, it made their Hearts re-
lent, and Pity moved them; especially the Spaniard Go-
vernor, who was the most Gentleman-like, generous-
minded Man that ever I met with in my Life: And he
roposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and
ring him to understand what they meant, so far as to •
be able to act as Interpreter, and to go among them,
and fee if they might be brought to some Conditions,
that might be depended upon to lave their Lives, and
to do us no Spoil.
It was some time before any of them could be taken;
but being weak and half-starv'd, one of them was at last
surprised, and made a Prisoner; he was sullen at first, and
would neither eat nor drink; but finding himself kindly
used, and Victuals given him, and no Violence offered
him, he at last grew tractable, and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the others would be
to them all; that they would not only save their Lives,
Vol. II, M but
but would give them a Part of the Island to live in,
provided they would give Satisfaction; that they should
keep in their own Bounds, and not come beyond them,
to injure or prejudice others; and that they mould have
Corn given them, to plant and make it grow for their
Bread, and some Bread given them for their present
Subsistence; and old Friday bade the Fellow go and talk
with the rest of his Countrymen, and fee what they
said to it; assuring them, that is they did not agree im-
mediately they mould all be destroyed.
The poor Wretches thoroughly humbled, and reduced
in Number to about thirty-seven, closed with the Pro-
posal at the first Offer, and begged to have some Food
given them; upon which -12 Spaniards, and 2 Englijb-
meny well arm'd, and 3 Indian Slaves, and old Friday,
marched to the Place where they were; the 3 Indian
Slaves carry'd them a large Quantity of Bread, and some
Rice boiled up to Cakes, and dry'd in the Sun, and 3
live Goats; and they were order'd to go to the Side of
an Hill, where they fat down, eat the Provisions very
thankfully, and were the most faithful Fellows to their
Words that could be thought of; for, except when
they came to beg Victuals and Directions, they never
came out of their Bounds; and there they Kved when
I came to the Island, and I went to fee them.
They had taught them both to plant Corn, make
Bread, breed tame Goats, and milk them; they wanted
nothing but Wives, and they soon would have been a
Nation: They were confined to a Neck of Land, sur-
rounded with high Rocks behind them, and lying plain
towards the Sea before them, on the South-east Corner
of the Island: They had Land enough, and it was very
good and fruitful; for they had a Piece of Land about
a Mile and half broad, 3 or 4 Miles in Length.
Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, such
as I made for myself; and gave among them 12
Hatchets, and 3 ox 4 Knives; and there they liv'd the
most subjected innocent Creatures, that ever were heard
of.
After this, the Colony enjoyed a perfect Tranquillity,
with respect to the Savages, till I came to re-visit them,
which was in about two Years; Not but that now-and-
thm feme Canoes of Savages came on shore for their
triumphal
triumphal unnatural Feasts; but as they were of several
Nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those that
came before, or the Reason of it, they did not make
any Search or Inquiry after their Countrymen; and if
they had, it would have been very hard for them to
have found them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of all that
happened to them, to my Return, at least, that was
worth Notice. The Indians) or Savages, were wonder-
fully civilized by them, and they frequently went
among them; but forbid, on Pain of Death, any of the
Indians coming to them, because they would not have
their Settlement betrayed again.
One Thing was very remarkable, <viz. that they
taught the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Baskets;
but they soon out-did their Masters ; for they made abun-
dance of most ingenious Things in Wicker-work; par-
ticularly, all Sorts of Baskets, Sieves, Bird-cages, Cup-
boards, &c. as also Chairs to fit on, Stools, Beds,
Couches, and abundance of other Things, being very
ingenious at such Work, when they were once put in
the Way of it.
My coming was a particular Relief to these People,
because we furriiirTd them with Knives, Scissars, Spades,
Shovels, Pick-axes, and all things of that Kind which
they could want*
With the Help of these Tools they were so very
handy, that they came, at last, to build up their Huts,
or Houses, very handsomely; raddling, or working it
up like Basket-work all the Way round, which was a
very extraordinary Piece of Ingenuity, and looked very
odd; but was an exceeding good Fence, as well against
Heat, as against all Sorts of Vermin; and our Men were
so taken with it, that they got the wild Savages to come
and do the like for them; so that when I came to see
the two Englijbmens Colonies, they looked, at a Distance,
as if they lived all like Bees in an Hive; and as for With
Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, ne-
cessary, and sober Fellow, he had made himself such
a Tent of Basket-work, as I believe was never seen; it
was 120 Paces round in the Outside, as I measured by
my Steps; the Walls were as close-work'd as a Basket,
in Pannels or Squares, 32 in Number, and very strong,
M 2 standing
standing about 7 Foot high: in the Middle was another
not above 22 Paces round, but built stronger, being
eight-square in its Form, and in the 8 Corners stood 8
very strong Posts, round the Top of which he laid strong
Pieces, joined together with wooden Pins, from which
he raisM a Pyramid before, the Roof of 8 Rafters, very
handsome, J assure you, and joined together very well,
though he had no Nails, and only a few iron Spikes,
which he had made himself too, out of the old Iron
that I had left there; and, indeed, this Fellow ihew'd
abundance of Ingenuity in several things which he had
no Knowledge of; he made himself a Forge, with a
Pair of wooden Bellows to blow the Fire; he made
himself Charcoal for his Work, and he formed out of
one of the Iron Crows a middling good Anvil to ham-
mer upon; in this Manner he made many Things,
but especially Hooks, Staples and Spikes, Bolts and
Hinges. But to return to the House; after he had
pitch'd the Roof of his innermost Tent, he work'd it
up between the Rafters with Basket-work, so firm,
and thatch'd that over again so ingeniously with Rice-
straw, and over that a large Leaf of a Tree, which
covered the Top, that his House was as dry as if it had
been til'd or slated. Indeed, he own'd, that the Sa-
vages made the Balket-work for him.
The outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean-to, all
round this inner Apartment, and long Rafters lay from
the 32 Angles to the Top Posts of the inner House be-
ing about 20 Foot distant; so that there was a Space
like a Walk, within the outer Wicker-wall, and with-
out the inner, near 20 Feet wide.
The inner Place he partitions off with the fame
Wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided it into 6
Apartments, for that he had 6 Rooms on a Floor, and
out of every one of these there was a Door j first, into
the Entry or Coming into the main Tent, and another
Door into the Space or Walk that was round it; so that
this Walk was also divided into six equal Parts, which
serv'd not only for Retreat, but to store up any Necessa-
ries which the Family had Occasion for. These six Spaces
not taking up the whole Circumference, what other
Apartments the outer Circle had, were thus order'd:
As soon as you were in at the Door of the outer Circle,
-you
you had a short Passage strait before you to the Door of
the inner House; but on either Side was a wicker Par-
tition, and a Door in it, by which you went, first, into
a large Room or Store-house, 20 Feet wide, and about
30 Feet long, and thro' that into another not quite so
long : So that in the outer Circle were 10 handsome
Rooms, 6 of which were only to be come at thro7 the
Apartments of the inner Tent, and served as Closets or
retir'd Rooms to the respective Chambers of the inner
Circle; and 4 large Warehouses or Barns, or what you
please to call them, which went in thro1 one another,
two on, either hand of the Passage* that led thro' the
outer Door to the inner Tent-
Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe, was never
seen in the World; nor an House or Tent, so neatly
contrived, much lese, so built : In this great Bee-hive
liv'd the 3 Families, that is to fay, Will Atkins, and his
Companion; the third was khTd, but his Wife remained
with 3 Children; for she was, it seems, big with Child
when he dy'd; and the other two were not at all back-
ward to give die Widow her full Share of every thing,
I mean, as to their Corn, Milk, Grapes, 13 c. and when
they kilPd a Kid, or found a Turtle on the Shore ^ so
that they all lived well enough, tho' it was true, they
were not so industrious as the other two, as has been
observed already.
One Thing, however, cannot be omitted; <viz. That,
as for Religion, I don't know that there was any thing
of that kind among them; they pretty often, indeed,
put one another in mind, that there was a God, by the
very common Method of Seamen, swearing by
his Name: Nor were their poor ignorant Savage Wives
much the better for having been marry'd to Christians,
as we must call'them; for as they knew very little of
God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of en-
tering into any Discourse with their Wives about a God,
or to talk any thing to them concerning Religion.
The otmoil of all the Improvement which I can fay
the Wives had made for them, was, that they had taught
them to speak English pretty well; and all the Children
they had, which were near 20 in all, were taught to
speak English too, from their first learning to speak,
tho' they at first spoke it in a very broken Manner, like
their
their Mothers. There were none of those Children
above six Years old when I came thither; for it was
not much above seven Years that they had fetch'd these
five Savage Ladies over, but they had all been pretty
fruitful, for they had all Children, more or less: I think
the Cook's Mate's Wife was big of her sixth Child ; and
the Mothers were all a good Sort of well-govern'd,
quiet, laborious Women, modest: and decent, helpful
to one another, mighty observant and subject to their
Masters, I cannot call them Husbands \ and wanted
nothing but to be well instructed in the Christian Re-
ligion, and to be legally marry'd; both which were
happily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, at
least:, by the Consequence of my coming among them.
Having thus giving an Account of the Colony in ge-
neral, and pretty much of my five runagate Englishmen,
I must fay something of the Spaniards, who were the
main Body of the Family; and in whose Story there
are some Incidents also remarkable enough.
I had a great many Discourses with them about their
Circumstances, when they were among the Savages:
They told me readily, that they had no Instances to give
of their Application or Ingenuity in that Country; that
they were a poor miserable dejected handful of People;
that if Means had been put into their Hands, they had
yet so abandons themselves to Despair, and so sunk
under the Weight os their Misfortunes, that they thought
of nothing but starving: One of them, a grave and
very sensible Man, told me, he was convinced they
were in the wrong; that it was not the Part of wife
Men, to give up themselves to their Misery, but always
to take hold of the Helps which Reason offered, as
well for present Support, as for future Deliverance:
He told me, that Grief was the most senseless insignifi-
cant Passion in the World; for that it regarded only
Things past:, which were generally impossible to be re-
call'd, or to be remedy'd, but had no View to Things to
come, and had no Share in any thing that looked like
Deliverance, but rather added to the Affliction, than
proposed a Remedy: And, upon this, he repeated a
Spanish Proverb; which though I cannot repeat in just
the fame Words that he spoke it, yet I remember I
made it into an English Proverb of my own thus:
In
In Trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your 'Trouble doubled.
He ran on then, in Remarks upon all the little Im-
provements I had made, in my Solitude; my unwearied
Application, as he called it, and how I had made a
Condition, which, in its Circumstances, was, at first,
much worse than theirs, a thousand times more happy
than theirs was, even now, when they were all toge-
ther: He told me, it was remarkable, that Englishmen
had a greater Presence os Mind, in their Distress, than
any People that ever he met with; that their unhappy-
Nation, and the Portuguese, were the worst Men in the
World to struggle with Misfortunes; for that their
first Step in Dangers, after common Efforts are over,
was always to despair, lie down under it, and die, with-
out rousing their Thoughts up to proper Remedies for
Escape.
I told him, their Case and mine differed exceedingly;
that they were cast upon the Shore without Necessaries,
without Supply of Food, or of present Sustenance, till
they could provide it: That it is true, I had this Dis-
advantage and Discomfort, that I was alone; but then
the Supplies I had providentially thrown into my Hands,
by the unexpected driving of the Ship on shore, was
such a Help as would have encouraged any Creature in
the World to have applied himself as I have done:
Seignior} fays the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards
been in your Cafe, we should never have gotten half
those Things out of the Ship as you did : Nay, fays he,
we should never have found means to have gotten a
Raft to carry them, or to have gotten a Raft on shore
without Boat or Sail; and, how much less should we
have done, said he, if any of us had been alone f Well,
I desired him to abate his Compliment, and go on with
the History of their coming on shore, where they
landed: He told me, they unhappily landed at a Place
where there were People without Provisions; whereas,
had they had the common Sense to have put off to Sea
again, and gone to another Island a little farther, they
had found Provisions, though without People; there
being an Island that Way, as they had been told, where
there
there were Provisions, though no People; that is to fay,
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there,
and filled the Island with Goats and Hogs at several
times; where they have bred in such Multitude, and
where Turtle and Sea-fowls were in such Plenty, that
they could have been in no want of Flesh, though they
had found no Bread; whereas here they were only
fustain'd with a few Roots and Herbs, which they un-
derstood not, and which had no Substance in them,
and which the Inhabitants gave them sparingly enough,
and who could treat them no better, unless they would
turn Canibals, and eat Mens Flelh, which was the great
Dainty of their Country.
They gave me an Account how many ways they
strove to civilize the Savages they were with, and to
teach them rational Customs in the ordinary Way of
Living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon
them, as unjust, that they who came thither for Assist-
ance and Support, should attempt to set up for Instructs
ors of those that gave them Bread ; intimating, it seems,
that none mould set up for the Instructors of others,
but those who could live without them.
They gave me dismal Accounts of the Extremities
they were driven to; how sometimes they were many
Days without any Food at all; the Island they were
upon being inhabited by a fort of Savages, that lived
more indolent, and, for that Reason, were less supplied
with the Necessaries of Life, than they had reason to
believe others were in the fame Part of the World; and
yet they found, that these Savages were less ravenous
and voracious, than those who had better Supplies of
Food.
Also they added, That they could not but see with
what Demonstrations of Wisdom and Goodness the go-
verning Providence of God directs the Event of Things
in the World: which, they said, appeared in their
Circumstances^; for if, pressed by the Hardships they were
«mder, and the Barrenness of the Country where they
were, they had searched after a better Place to live in,
they had then been out of the Way of the Relief that
happened to them by my means.
Then they gave me an Account, how the Savages,
whom they lived among, expected them to go out with
4 them
them into their Wars: And it was true, that, as they
iiad Fire-arms with them, had they not had the Disaster
to lose their Ammunition, they should not have been
serviceable only to their Friends, but have made them-
selves terrible both to Friends and Enemies; but be-
ing without Powder and Shot, and yet in a Condition,
that they could not in Reason deny to go out with
their Landlords to their Wars; when they came into
the Field of Battle, they were in a worse Condition
than the Savages themselves; for they neither had Bows
nor Arrows, nor could they use those the Savages gave
them ; so that they could do nothing but stand still, and
be wounded with Arrows, till they came up to the
Teeth of their Enemy; and then, indeed, the three
Halberts they had, were of Use to them; and they
would often drive a whole little Army before them,
with those Halberts and sharpened Sticks put into the
Muzzles of their Musquets: But that for all this they -
were sometimes surrounded with Multitudes, and in
great Danger from their Arrows; till at last they'found
the way to make themselves large Targets of Wood,
which they covered with Skins of wild Beasts, whose
Names they knew not; and these covered them from
the Arrows of the Savages; that, notwithstanding these,
they were sometimes in great Danger, and were once
five of them knocked down together, with the Clubs of
the Savages, which was the Time when one of them
was taken Prisoner; that is to fay, the Spaniards whom
I had relieved: That at first they thought he had been
killed, but when afterwards they heard he was taken
Prisoner, they were under the greatest Grief imagina-
ble, and would willingly have all ventured their Lives to
have rescued him,
They told me, That when they were so knocked
down, the rest of their Company rescued them, and
stood over them, fighting till they were come to them-
selves, all but he who they thought had been dead; and,
then they made their Way with their Halberts and Pieces,
standing close together in a Line, through a Body of
above a thousand Savages, beating down all that came
in their Way, got the Victory over their Enemies, but
to their great Sorrow, because it was with the Loss of
their Friend; whom, the other Party finding him alive,
Vol, IL W, 17, N carried
carried off with some others, as I gave an Account in
my former.
They described most affectionately, how they were
surprised with Joy at the Return of their Friend and
Companion in Misery, who they thought had been de-
voured by wild Beasts of the worst kind, viz. by wild
Men; and, yet how more and more they were sur-
prised with the Account he gave them of his Errand,
and that there was a Christian in any Place near, much
more one that was able, and had Humanity enough,
to contribute to their Deliverance.
They described how they were astonished at the
Sight os the Relief I sent them, and at the Appearance
of Loaves of Bread, Things they had not seen since their
coming to that miserable Place; how often they crossed
it, and blessed it as Bread sent from Heaven; and what
a reviving Cordial it was to their Spirits to taste it; as,
also, of the other Things I had sent for their Supply.
And, after all, they would have told me something of
the Joy they were in, at the Sight of a Boat and Pilots
to carry 'em away to the Person and Place, from whence
all these new Comforts came; but they told me, it was
impossible to express it by Words; for their. excessive
Joy naturally driving them to unbecoming Extrava-
gancies, they had no way to describe them, but by tel-
ling me, that they bordered upon Lunacy, having no
way to give Vent to their Passion, suitable to the Sense
that was upon them; that, in some it worked one
Way, and in some another; and that some of them,
through a Surprise of Joy, would burst out into Tears;
others be half-mad, and others immediately faint.
This Disc©urse extremely affected me, and called to my
Mind Fridays Ecstasy, when he met his Father, and the
poor Peoples Ecstasy, when I took them up at Sea,
after their Ship was on lire; the Mate of the Ship's
Joy, when he found himself delivered in the Place,
where he expected to perish; and my own Joy, when,
after 28 Years Captivity, I found a good Ship ready to
carry me to my own Country: All these things made
me more sensible of the Relation of these poor Men,
and more affected with it.
Having thus given a View of the State of Things,
as I found them, I must relate the Heads of what I did
for
for these People; and the Condition in which I left
'em. It was their Opinion, and mine too, that they
would be troubled no more with the Savages; or that,
if they were, they would be able to cut them off, if
they were twice as many as before; so that they had
no Concern about that. Then I enter'd into a serious
Discourse with the Spaniard whom I cali'd Governor,
about their Stay in the Island; for, as I was not come
to carry any of them off, so it would not be just to
carry off some, and leave others, who perhaps, would
be unwilling to stay, if their Strength was diminished.
On the other hand, I told them, I came to establish
- 'em there, not to remove 'em; and then I let 'em know,
that I had brought with me Relief of sundry Kinds for
them : that I had been at a great Charge to supply them
with all things necessary; as well for their Conveni-
ence, as their Defence; and that I had such and such
particular Persons with me, as well to increase and re-
cruit their Number, as by the particular necessary Em-
ployments which they were bred to, being Artificers,
to assist them in those things, in which, at present,
they were to seek.
They were all together, when I talk'd thus to them;
and before I deliver'd to 'em the Stores I had brought, I
asked them, one by one, if they had intirely forgot and
buried the first Animosities that had been among them,
and could shake Hands with one another, and engage in
a strict Friendship, and Union of Interest, so that there
might be no more Misunderstandings or Jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of Frankness and
Good-humour, said, They had met with Afflictions
enough to make them all sober, and Enemies enough
to make them all Friends: that, for his Part, he would
live and die with them; and was so far from designing
any thing against the Spaniards, that, he owned, they
had done nothing to him but what his own mad Hu-
mour made necessary, and what he would have done,
and, perhaps, much worse, in their Case; and that he
would ask them Pardon, if I desired it, for the foolisli
and brutisti Things he had done to them; and was
very willing and desirous of living in Terms of in tire
Friendship and Union with them; and would do any
thing that lay in his Power to convince them of it;
N? And
And as* for going to England^ ht cared not if he dkl?
not go thither these twenty Years.
The, Spaniards said, They had, indeed, at first, dis-
armed and excluded William Atkinsy and his two Coun-
trymen, for their ill Conduct, as they had let me know:
And they appealed to me, for the Necessity they were
under to do so ; but that William Atkins had behaved
himself so bravely in the great Fight they had with)
the Savages, and on severaL Occasions since, and had
shewed himself so faithful to, and concerned for the
general Interest of them all, that they had forgotten all*
that was past; and thought he merited as much to be
trusted with Arms, and supplied with Necessaries, as
any of them; and that they had testified their Satis-
faction in him, by committing the Command to hinv
next to the Governor himself: And as they had an in-
tire Confidence in him, and all his Countrymen, so they
acknowledged, they had merited that Confidence, by
all the Methods that honest Men could merit to be va-
kred and trusted: And they most heartily embraced the
Occasion of giving me this Assurance, that they would
never have any Interest separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open Declarations of Friend-
ship, we appointed, the next Day, to dine all together;
and indeed, we made a splendid Feast: I caused the
Ship's Cook, and his Mate to come on lhore, and dress
our Dinner; and the old Cook's Mate we had on shore,
assisted. We brought on more six Pieces of good Beef
and four Pieces of Pork, out of the Ship's Provision,
with our Punch-Bowl, and Materials- to fill it; and, in
particular, I gave them ten Bottles of French Claret,
and ten Bottles of English Beer; Things that neither the
Spaniards^ or the EngHJhmen, had tasted for many Years ;.
and which, it may be supposed, they were exceeding
glad os.
The Spaniards added to our Feast five whole Kids,
which the Cooks roasted; and three of them were sent
covered up close on board our Ship, to the Seamen,
that they might feast on fresh Meat from on more, aa
we did with their salt Meat from on board.
After this Feast, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought- out my Cargo of Goods, wherein,
that there might be- no Dispute about dividing, I Ihewed-
them
them there was sufficient for them all; and desir'd,*
that they might all take an equal Quantity of the Good*
that were for wearing; that is to fay, equal when made
up: As first, I distributed Linen sufficient to make every
one of them four Shirts; and, at the Spaniards Request;,
afterwards made them up fix; these were exceeding,
comfortable to them, having been what, as I may fay,
they had long since forgot the Use of, or what it was to-
wear them.
I allotted the thin Englijb Stuffs, which I mentioned
before, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frockr
which I judged fittest for the Heat of the Season, cool,
and loose 5 and ordered, that whenever they decayed^
they should make more, as they thought sit: The like
for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings, and Hats, &c.
I cannot express what Pleasure, what Satisfaction*,
fat upon the Countenances of all these poor Men, when-
they saw the Care I had taken of them, and how well
I had furnished them : They told me, I was a Father
to them; and that, having such a Correspondent as I
was, in so remote a Part of the World, it would make
them forget, that they were left in a desolate Place:
And they ail voluntarily engaged to me, not to leave
the Place without my Consent.
Then I presented to them the People J had brought
with me; particularly the Taylor, the Smith, and the
two Carpenters, all of them most necessary People; but,
above all, my general Artificer, than whom they could
not name any thing that was more needful to them; and
the Taylor, to shew his Concern for them, went to work
immediately, and, with my Leave, made them every
one a Shirt the first thing he did; and, which was still
more, he taught the Women not only how to few md
stitch, and use the Needle, but made them assist to make
the Shirts for their Husbands, and for all the rest.
As to the Carpenters, I scarce need mention how-
useful they were; for they took in pieces all my clumsy
unhandy Things, and made them clever convenient Ta-
bles, Stools, Bedsteads, Cupboards, Lockers, Shelves*
and every thing they wanted of that kind.
But, to let them fee how Nature made Artificers at.
first,. I carried the Carpenters to fee William dtkim-s
Baiket house, as I called it; and they both owned, they
never
never saw an Instance of such natural Ingenuity before)
nor any thing so regular, and so handily built, at least
of its kind: And one of them, when he saw it, after
musing a good while, turning about to me, I am sure,
says he, that Man has no need of us; you need do
nothing but give him Tools.
Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools, and
gave every Man a digging-Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake,
for we had no Harrows, or Ploughs; and, to every
separate Place, a Pickax, a Crow, a broad Ax, and a
Saw; always appointing, that as often as any were
broken, or worn out, they should be supplied, without
grudging, out of the general Stores that I left behind.
Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Chissels, Knives,
Scissors, and all Sorts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had
without Tale, as they required; for no Man would care
to take more than they wanted; and he must be a Fool
that would waste or spoil them, on any Account what-
ever: And, for the Use of the Smith, I left two Ton
of unwrought Iron for a Supply.
My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought
them, was such, even to Profusion, that they could not
but rejoice at them; for now they could march as I
used to do, with a Musquet upon each Shoulder, if
there was Occasion; and were able to light iooo Sa-
vages, if they had but some little Advantages of Situa-
tion; which also they could not miss of, if they had
Occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young Man, whose
Mother was starved to Death, and the Maid also; me
was a sober, well educated, religious young Woman,
and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave her
spgood Word: She had, indeed, an unhappy Tife with
us, there being no Woman in the Ship but herself; but
me bore it with Patience. Aster a while, seeing things
so well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving, upon
my Island ; and considering, that they had neither Bu-
siness or Acquaintance in the East'-Indies, or Reason
for taking so long a Voyage; I say, considering all
this, both of them came to me, and desir'd I would
give them Leave to remain on the Island, and be en-
tered among my Family, as they called it.
J agreed to it readily ; and they had a little Plot of
Ground
Ground allotted to them, where they had three Tents,
or Houses set up, surrounded with a Basquet-work,
palisado'd like Ækinis> and adjoining to his Plantation:
Their Tents were contrived so, that they had each of
them a Room apart to lodge in, and a Middle Tent,
like a great Storehouse, to lay all their Goods in, and to
eat and drink in: And now the other two Englishmen
removed their Habitation to the fame Place; and ib the
Island was divided into three Colonies, and no more;
viz. the Spaniards with old Fridayt and the first Servants,
at my old Habitation under the Hill; which was, in a
Word, the capital City; and where they had so en-
larged and extended their Works, as well under, as on
the Outside of the Hill, that they lived, tho' perfectly
concealed, yet full at large. Never was there such a
little City in a Wood, and so hid, I believe, in any Part
of the World: For, I verily believe, i ooo Men might
have ranged the Island a Month, and, if they had not
known there was such a thing, and looked on Purpose
for it, they would not have sound it; for the Trees
stood so thick, and so close, and grew so fast matted
into one another, that nothing but cutting them down
first, could discover the Place; except the two narrow
Entrances, where they went in and out, could be found;
which was not very easy One of them was just down
at the Water's Edge, on the Side of the Creek; and it
was afterwards above 200 Yards to the Place; and the
other was up the Ladder at twice, as I have already
formerly described it; and they had a large Wood, thick
planted, also, on the Top of the Hill, which contained
above an Acre, which grew apace, and covered the
Place from all Discovery there, with only one narrow
Place between two Trees, not easy to be discovered, to
enter on that Side.
The other Colony was that of Will. Atkins's, where
there were four Families of Englishmen^ I mean those I
had left there, with their Wives and Children; three
Savages, that were Slaves; the Widow and Children of
the Englijhman that was killed: the young Man and
the Maid, and, by the way, we made a Wife of her
also, before we went away: There were also the two
Carpenters and the Taylor, who I brought with me,
for ^hem; also the Smith, who was a very necessary
Man
•Man to them, especially as a Gunsmith, to take care of
their Arms; and my other Man Whom I called Jack of
trades; who was, himseif^as good, almost, as 2p
"Men; for he was not only a very ingenious Fellow, but a
very merry Fellow; and, before I went away, we
married him to the honest Maid that came with the
Youth in the Ship ; whom I mentioned before.
And now I speak of Marrying, it brings me naturally
to fay something of the French Ecclesiastic, that I had
•brought with me out of the Ship's Crew, whom I took
at Sea, It is true, this Man was a Roman, and, per-
haps it may give Offence to some hereafter, if I leave
•any thing extraordinary upon Record, of a Man, whom,
before I begin, I must (to set him out in just Colours)
represent in Terms very much to his Disadvantage, in
the Account of Protestants; as first, that he was a Pa-
fist; secondly, a Popijh Priest; and thirdly, a French
Popijh Priest.
But Justice demands of me to give him a due Cha-
racter; and I must fay, He was a grave, sober, pious,
and most religious Person; exact in his Life, extensive
in his Charity, and exemplary in almost every thing he
did: What, then, can any one fay, against my being very
sensible of the Value of such a Man, notwithstanding
his Profession? Though it may be my Opinion, per-
haps, as well as the Opinion of others, who shall read
this, that he was mistaken.
The first Hour that I began to converse with him,
after he had agreed to go with me to the East-Indies9
I found Reason to delight exceedingly in his Conversa-
tion: And he first began with me, about Religion, in
the most obliging .manner imaginable.
Sir, says he, You have not only, under God (and, at
.that, he cross'd his Breast} saved my Life, but you have
.-admitted me to go this Voyage in your Ship, and, by
your obliging Civility, have taken me into your family,
firing me an Opportunity of free Conversation: Now,
tSir, fays he, you fee by my Habit, what my Profession
is; and I guess by your Nation, what yours is: I may
ithink it is my Duty, and, doubtless it is so, to use my
utmost Endeavours, on all Occasions, to bring all the
-Souls that I can to the Knowledge of the Truth, and,to
embrace the Catholic Doctrine; but, as I am here on-
5 der
der your Permission, and in vour Family, I am bounds,
in Justice to your Kindness, as well as in Decency ancl!
good Manners, to be under your Government j and*
therefore, I shall not, without your Leave, eriter into
any Debates on the Points of Religion, in which we*
may not agree, farther than you shall give me Leave.
I told him, his Carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were
such People as they called Heretics; but that he was
not the first Catholic that I had conversed with, with-
out falling into any Inconveniences, or carrying the
Questions to any Height in Debate; that he should not
find himself the worse used for being of a different Opi-
nion from us; and if we did not converse without any
Dislike on either Side, upon that Score, it would be
his Fault, not ours.
He replied, That he thought our Conversation might
be easily separated from Disputes ,• that it was not his
Business to cap Principles with every Man he discoursed
with j and that he rather desired me to converse with
him as a Gentleman, than as a Rcligieux; that if I would
give him leave, at any time, to discourse upon reli-
gious Subjects, he would readily comply with it; and
that then he did not doubt but I would allow him
also to defend his own Opinions, as well as he could:
But that, without my Leave, he would not break in
upon me with any such-thing.
He told me farther, That he would not cease to do all
that became him in his Office, as a Priest, as well as a.
private Christian* to procure the Goods of the Ship, and
the Safety of all that was in her: And though, per-
haps, we would not join with fchn, and he could not
pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which
he would do upon all Occasions. In this manner we
conversed; and, as he was of a most obliging gentle-
man-like Behaviour, so he was, if I may be allowed to
fay so, a Man of good Sense, and, as I believe, of
great Learning,
He gave me a most diverting Account of his Life,
and of the many extraordinary Events of it; of many
Adventures which :had befallen him in the few Years
that he had been Abroad in the World, and particu-
larly .this was very remarkable; That during the
Vo-l, II. O Voyage
Voyage he was now engaged in, he had the Misfortune to
be five times ihip'd and unsliip'd, and never to go to the
Place whither any of the Ships he was in, were at first
designed: That his first Intent was, to have gone to
Martinico; aud that he went on board a Ship bound
thither, at Malo; but being forced into Lisbon by
bad Weather, the Ship received some Damage, by run-
ning aground in the Mouth of the River Tagus, and
was obliged to unload her Cargo there: That finding
a Portuguese Ship there bound to the Madeiras, and
ready to fail, and supposing he mould easily meet with
a Vessel there bound to Martinico, he went on board, in
order to sail to the Madeiras; but the Master of the
Portuguese Ship, being but an indifferent Mariner, had
been out in his Reckoning, and they drove to Fial;
where, however, he happened to find a very good Mar-
ket for his Cargo, which was Corn; and therefore re-
solved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load Salt at
the IJle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland: He
had no Remedy in this Exigence, but to go with the
Ship; and had a pretty good Voyage as far as the Banks,
so they call the Place where they catch the Fish, where
meeting with a French Ship, bound from France to
Quebeck, in the River of Canada, and from thence to
Martinico, to carry Provisions, he thought he should have
an Opportunity to complete his first Design: But when
he came to Quebeck, the Master of the Ship died, and
the Ship proceeded no farther: So the next Voyage
he shipp'd himself for France, in the Ship that was
burnt, when we took them up at Sea, and then fhipp'd
them with us for the East-Indies, as I have already
.said. Thus he had been disappointed in five Voyages,
all, as I may call it, in one Voyage, besides what I shall
have Occasion to mention farther of the fame- Person.
But I mall not make Digressions into other Mens
Stories, which have no Relation to my own. I return
to what concerns our Affair in the Island : He came to
me one Morning, for he lodged among us all the while
we were upon the Island and it happened to be just
when I was going to visit the Englishmen* Colony, at the
farthest Part of the Island; I fay, he came to me, and
toJd me, with a very grave Countenance, That he had,
for two or three Days, desired an Opportunity of som*
5 Discourse
Discourse with me, which, he hoped, would not be dis*
pleasing to me, because he thought it might, in some
measure, correspond with my general Design; which
was the Prosperity of my new Colony; and, perhaps
might put it, at least, more than he yet thought it was,
in the way of God's Blessing.
I look'd a little furpriz'd at the last Part of his Dis-
course; and turning a little Ihort, How, Sir, said I, can
it be said, that we are not in the way of God's Blessing,
after such visible Assistances, and wonderful Deliver-
ances, as we have seen here, and of which I have given
you a large Account?
If you had pleas'd, Sir, said he (with a world of
Modesty, and yet with great Readiness) to have heard
me, you would have found no room to have been dis-
pleased, much less to think so hard of me, that I should
suggest, that you have not had wonderful Assistances and
Deliverances: And, I hope, on your Behalf, that you
are in the way of God's Blessing, and your Design is ex-
ceeding good, and will prosper. But, Sir, said he, tho'
it were more so, than is even possible to you, yet there
may be some among you, that are not equally right in
their Actions , And you know, that in the Story of
Israel\ one Achan, in the Camp, removed God's Bles-
sing from them, and turned his Hand so against them,
that 36 of them, though not concerned in the Crime,
were the Objects of Divine Vengeance, and bore the
Weight of that Punishment.
I was sensibly touch'd with this Discourse, and told
him, His Inference was so just, and the whole Design
seemed so sincere, and was really so religious in its own
Nature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted him;
and begg'd him to go on: And, in the mean time,
because it seem'd, that what we had both to say, might
take up some Time, I told him, I was going to the
Englishmen* Plantations; and afk'd him to go with me,
and we might discourse of it by the Way : He told me, He
would more willingly wait on me thither, because there,
partly, the Thing was acted, which he desir'd to speak
to me about: So we walk'd on; and I press'd him to
be free and plain with me, in what he had to fay.
Why then, Sir, fays he, be pleased to give me Leave?
to lay down a sew Propositions, as the Foundation of
O 2 what
what I have to say, that we may not differ in the ,gar
neral Principles, tho' we may be of some differing Opi-
nions in the Practice of Particulars. First, Sir, tho' we
differ in some of the doctrinal Articles of Religion, and
it is very unhappy, that it is so, especially in the Case
before us, as I shall shew afterwards; yet, there are some
general Principles in which we both agree; *-jiz. First;
that there is a God ; and that this God having given us
some stated general Rules for our Service and Obedience,
we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him, ei-
ther by neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by
doing what he has exprefly forbidden: And let our dif-
ferent Religions be what they will, this general Princi*
pie is readily owned by us all; That the Blessing of
God does not ordinarily follow a presumptuous Sinning
against his Command; and every good Christian will be
affectionately concerned to prevent any that are under
his Care, living in a total Neglect of God and his Com-
mands. It is not your Men being Protestants, what-
ever my Opinion may be of such, that discharges me
from being concerned for their Souls, and from endea-
vouring, if it lies before me, that they should live in as
little Distance from, and Enmity with, their Maker as
possible; especially, if you give me Leave to meddle
so far in your Circuit.
I could not yet imagine what he aim'd at, and told
him, I granted all he had said; and thank'd him, that
he would so far concern himself for us; and begged he
would explain the Particulars, of what he had observ'd,
that, like Jojhva (to take his own Parable). I might put
away the accursed Thing from us.
Why, then, Sir, fays he, I will take the Liberty you
o-ive me; and there are three Things, which, if I am
nght, must stand in the way of God's Blessing upon
your Endeavours here, and which I should rejoice, for
vour Sake, and their own, to fee remov'd. And, Sir,
fays he, i promise myself, that you- will fully agree with
me in them-all, as soon as I name them; especially, be-
cause I (hall convince you, that every one of them
may, with great Ease, and very much to your Satis-
.faction, be remedied.
He cave me no Leave to put in any more Civilities,
but went on. First, Sir, fays he, you have here four
Englishmen •>
Englishmen, who have fetch'd Women from among the
Savages, and have taken them as their Wives, and have
had many Children by them all, and yet are not mar-
ried to them after any stated legal Manner, as the Laws
of God and Man require; and therefore are yet, in the
Sense of both, no less than Adulterers, and living in
Adultery. To this, Sir, fays he, I know you will ob-
ject, that there was no Clergymen, or Prieit of any
Kind, or of any Profession, to perform the Ceremony;
nor any Pen and Ink, or Paper, to write down a Con-
tract of Marriage, and have signed it between them.
And I know also, Sir, what the Spaniard Governor has
told you; I mean, of the Agreement that he obliged
them to make, when they took these Women, w^.
That they should chuse them out by Consent, and keep
separately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of
a Marriage, no Agreement with the Women as Wives,
but only an Agreement among themselves, to keep
'em from quarrelling.
But, Sir, the Essence of the Sacrament of Matrimony
(so he calPd it, being a Reman) consists not only in the
mutual Consent os the Parties to take one another, as
Man and Wife, but in the formal and legal Obligation*
that there is in the Contract, to compel the Man and
Woman, at all times, to own and acknowledge each
other 5 obliging the Man to abstain from all other Wo-
men, to engage in no other Contract while these sub-
fist; and orrall (^f^asions, as Ability allows, to provide
honestly for thein,,* and their Children; and to oblige
the Women "to.the"Jsame, or like Conditions, mutatis
?nulamiis, on their Sid*.,
Now, Sir, fays he,, 'these Men may, when they please*
or when Occasion presents, abandon these Women, dip
Own their Children, leave them to perish, and take
other Women, and marry them whilst these are living.
And'here he added, with some Warmth, How, Sir, is
God honoured in this unlawful Liberty? And how shall
a Blessing succeed your Endeavours in this Place, how-
ever good in them!elves, and however sincere in your
Design, while these Men, who, at presen^ .are your
Subjects, under your absolute Government and Domi-
nion, are allowed by you to live in oponrAdultery -?
. I cen-
I confess, I was struck at the Thing itself, but much
more with the convincing Arguments he supported it
with; for it was certainly true, that though they had
no Clergyman on the Spot, yet a formal Contract on
both Sides, made before Witnesses, and confirmed by
any Token, which they had all agreed to be bound by,
though it had been but the breaking a Stick between
them, engaging the Men to own these Women for
their Wives upon all Occasions, and never to abandon
them, or their Children, and the Women to the fame
with their Husbands, had been an effectual lawful Mar-
riage in the Sight of God; and it was a great Neglect,
that it was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off* with my young
Priest, by telling him, That all that Part was done when
I was not here; and they had lived so many Years with
them now, that, if it was an Adultery, it was past
Remedy; they could do nothing in it now.
Sir, fays he, asking your Pardon for such Freedom%
you are right in this. That it being done in your Ab-
fence, you could not be charged with that Part of the
Crime. But I beseech you, flatter not yourself, that
you are not therefore under an Obligation to do your
uttermost now to put an End to it: How can you
think, but that, let the Time past lie on whom it will,
all the Guilt, for the future, will lie intirely upon you:
because it is certainly in your Power now to put an End
to it; and in nobody's ?ower but yours.
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right;
but I imagined, that, by putting an End to it, he
meant, that I mould part them, and not suffer them
tp live together any longer: And I said to him, I could
not do that by any means, for that it would put the
whole Island in Confusion. He seemed surprised, that
I should so far mistake him. No, Sir, says he, I do
not mean, that you should separate them, but legally
and effectually marry them now: And, Sir, as my
way of marrying them may not be so easy to reconcile
them to, though it will be as effectual, even by your
own Laws * so your way may be as well before God,
and as valid among Men; I mean, by a written Con^
tract, signed by both Man and Woman, and by all the
Witnesses present; which all the Laws of Europe would
decree to be valid. I was
I was amazed to fee so much true Piety, and so much
Sincerity of Zeal, besides the unusual Impartiality in
his Discourse, as to his own Party or Church; and such
a true Warmth for the preserving People that he had no
Knowledge of, or Relation to; I say, for preserving
them from trangresling the Laws of God; the like of
which, I had, indeed, not met with any-where. But re-
collecting what he had said, of marrying them by a
written Contract, which I knew would stand too; I re-
turned it back upon him, and told him, I granted all that
he had said to be just, and, on his Part, very kind, that
I would discourse with the Men upon the Point now,
when I came to them. And I knew no Reason why they
should scruple to let him marry them all ; which I knew
well enough would be granted to be as authentic and
valid in England> as if they were married by one of
our own Clergymen. What was afterwards done in
this Matter, I shall speak of by itself.
I then press M him to tell me, what was the second
Complaint which he had to make ; acknowledging, that
I was very much his Debtor for the first; and thanked
him heartily for it. He told me, He would use^the
fame Freedom and Plainness in the Second, and hoped
I would take it as well: And this was, That, notwith-
standing these EngUJb Subjects of mine, as he called
them, had lived with these Women for almost seven
Years, and had taught them to speak English, and even
to read it; and that they were, as he perceived, Women
of tolerable Understanding, and capable of Instruction;
yet they had not to this Hour taught them any thing of
the Christian Religion; no, not so much as to know,
that there was a God, or a Worship, or in what Manner
God was to be served; or that their own Idolatry, and
worshipping they knew not who, was false and absurd.
This, he said, was ah unaccountable Neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to an account for;
and, perhaps, at last take the Work out of their Hands.
He (poke this very affectionately and warmly. I am
persuaded, says he, had those Men lived in the Savage
Country, whence their Wives came, the Savages would
have taken more Pains to have brought them to be
Idolaters, and to worship the Devil, than any of these
Men, so far as I can fee, has taken with them,
to
to teach them the.Know]edge of the True God. Now,
Sir, said he, tho' I do not acknowledge your Religion,
or you mine, yet we should be all glad to see the De-
vil's Servants, and the Subjects of his Kingdom, taught
to know the general Principles of the Christian Reli-
gion; that they might, at least, hear of God, and of a
.Redeemer, and of the Resurrection, and of a future
State, Things which we all believe ; they had* at least,
been so much nearer coming into the Bosom of the
true Church, than they are now in the public Profession
of Idolatry, and Devil-worship.
. I could hold no longer; I took him in my Arms, and
embraced him with an Excess of Passion: How far, said
I to him, have I been from understanding the most es-
sential Part os a Christian; viz. to love the Interest of
the Christian Church, and the Good of other Mens
Souls? I (carce have known what belongs to being a
Christian. O, Sir, do not fay ib, replied he; this Thing
is not your Fault. No! said I; but why did I never
lay it to Heart as well as you? 'Tis not too late yet,
said he, be not too forward to condemn yourself. But,
what can be done now? said I; you see I am going
away. Will you give me leave, said he, to talk with
these poor Men about it? Yes, with all my Heart, said
I; and will oblige them to give heed to what you say
too. As to that, said he, we must leave them to the
Mercy of Christ; but 'tis our Business to assist them, en-
courage them, and instruct them; and, if you will give
me leave, and God his Blessing, 1 do not doubt but
the poor ignorant Souls mall be brought home into the
great Circle of Christianity, if not into the particular
Faith that we all embrace; and that even while you
stay here. Upon this, I said, I shall not only give you
leave, but give you a thousand Thanks for it. What
followed on this Account I shall mention also again in
its Place. >
I now press'd him for the third Article in which we
were to blame: Why, really, fays he, it is of the fame
Nature, and I will proceed (a/Icing your Leave) with the
fame Plainness as before: It is about your poor Savages
yonder, who are (as I may fay) your conquer'd Subjects.
Jt is a Maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be received
among all Christians, of what Church, or pretended
Church
Church soever; visb. That Christian Knowledge ought
to be propagated, by all possible Means, and on all pos-
sible Occasions. 'Tis on this Principle that our ChurcK
fends Missionaries into Persia, India, and China; and
that our Clergy, even of the superior Sort, willingly
engage in the most hazardous Voyages, and the most
dangerous Residence among Murderers and Barbarians,
to teach them the Knowledge of the True God, and to
bring them over to embrace the Christian Faith. Now,
Sir, you have such an Opportunity here, to have fix or
seven-and-thirty poor Savages brought over from Ido-
latry to the Knowledge of God, their Maker and Re-
deemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an Oc-
casion of doing good; which is really worth the Ex-
pence of a Man's whole Life. ?*
I was now strudc dumb indeed, and had not one:
Word to fay: I had here a Spirit of true Christian
Zeal for God and Religion before me, let his particular
Principles be of what kind soever: As for me, I had
not so much as entertained a Thought of this in my
Heart before; and, I believe, should not have thought
of it; for I looked upon these Savages as Slaves, and
People, whom, had we any Work for them to do, we
would have used as such, or would have been glad to
have transported them to any other Part of the World;
for our Business was to get rid of them ; and we would
all have been satisfied, if they had been sent to any Coun-
try, so they had never seen their own. But to the Case,
I say, I was confounded at his Discourse, and knew not
what Answer to make him. He looked earnestly at me,
seeing me in some Disorder: Sir, said he, I shall be very^
sorry, if what I have said gives you any Offence: No,
no, said I; I am offended with nobody but myself; but
I am perfectly confounded, not only to think, that I
ihould never take any Notice of this before, but with re-
flecting, what Notice I am able to take of it now. You*
know Sir, said I, what Circumstances I am in; I am
bound to the East-bidia, in a Ship freighted by Mer-
chants, and to whom it would be an insufferable Piece
of Injustice to detain their Ship here, the Men lying
all this while at Victuals and Wages1 upon the Owners
Account: It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve Days
here; and if J stay more, I must pay 37. Sterling ptr
Vol. II, P diem
diem Demorage: Nor can I stay upon Demorage above*
eight Days more; and I have been here thirteen Days
already; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this
Work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind
here again; in which Case, if this single Ship should mis-
carry in any Part of her Voyage, I should be just in the
same Condition that I was left in here at first; and from
which I have been so wonderfully delivered.
He owned the Case was very hard upon me as to my
Voyage; but laid it home upon my Conscience, whe-
ther the Blessing of saving seven-and-thirty Souls was
not worth my venturing all I had in the World for?
I was not so sensible of that as he was; -and I returnM
upon him thus: Why, Sir, it is a valuable Thing in-
deed, to be arf instrument, in God's Hand, to convert
seven-and-thirty Heathens to the Knowledge of Christ:
But as you are an Ecclesiastic, and are given over to
that Work, so that it seems naturally to fall into the
way of your Profession; how is it then, that you do
not rather offer yourself to undertake it, than press me
to it?
Upon this he facM about, just before me, as he walk'4
along, and putting me to a full Stop, made me a very
low Bow; 1 most heartily thank God, and you, Sir, fays
he, for giving me so evident a Call to so bjessed a Work;
and if you think yourself discharged from it, and de-
sire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and
think it a happy Reward for all the Hazards and Dif-
Eculties of such a broken, disappointed Voyage as I
have met with, that I have dropt at last in. to so glorious
a Work.
I discovered a kind of Rapture in his Face, while he
spoke this to me; his Eyes sparkled like Fire, his Face
glow'd, and his Colour came and went, as if he had
been falling into Fits: In a word, he was sired with
the Joy of being eiribark'd in such a Work. J paused
a considerable while, before I could tell what to say to
him ; for I was really surprised to find a Man of such
Sincerity and Zeal, and carried out in his £eal, beyond
the ordinary Rate of Men, not of his Profession only,
bat even of any Profession whatsoever: But, after I
Jiad considered it a while, I aiked him seriously, if he
jv^s in earnest, and that he would venture on the single
i Con-
Consideration of an Attempt on those poor people, to
fee lock'd up in an unplanted Island for, perhaps, his
Life; and at last might not know whether he should
be able to do them any good, or not?
He turn'd short upon me, and afk'd me> what I calPd
a Venture: Pray, Sir, said he, what do you think I
consented to go in your Ship to the East-Indies for r
Nay, said I, that I know not, unless it was to preach
to the Indians. Doubtless it was, said he; and do you
think, if I can convert these seven-and-thirty Men to
the Faith of Christ, it is not worth my Time, though
I should never be fetched off the Island again? Nay,
is it not infinitely of more Worth to save so many Souls,
than my Life, is, or the Life of twenty more of the
fame Profession? Yes, Sir, fays he, 1 would give Christ
and the blessed Virgin Thanks all my Days, if I could
be made the least happy Instrument of saving the Souls,
of these poor Men, tho' I was never to set my Foot off
this Island, or fee my native Country any more: But*
since you will honour me, fays he, with putting me
into this Work (for which I will pray for you all the
jDays of niy Life) I have one humble Petition to you,
said he, besides. What is that? said I. Why, says he,
it is, that you will leave your Man Friday with me, to
be my Interpreter to them, and to assist me; for with-
out some Help I cannot speak to them, or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, be-
cause I could not think of parting with him, and that
for many Reasons; he had been the Companion of my
Travels; he was not Only faithful to me, but sincerely
affectionate to the last Degree i and I had resolved to
do something considerable for him, if he outlived me,
as it was probable he would: Then I knew, that as 1
had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite
confound him to bring him to embrace another Profes-
sion; and he would never, while his Eyes were open,
believe that his old Master was an Heretic, and would
be damn'd; and this might in the End ruin the poor - .
Fellow's Principles, and so turn him back again to ids
first Idolatry.
However, a sudden Thought relieved me in this
Streight, and it was this; I told him I could not fay,
that I was willing to part with Friday on any Account
P 2 whau
whatever; though a Work, that to him was of more
Value than his Ljfe, ought to be to me of much
more Value than the keeping or parting with a Ser-
vant. But, on the other hand, I was persuaded, that
Friday would by no Means consent to part with me;
and then to force him to it, without his Consent, would
be manifest Injustice; because I had promised I would
never put him away; and he had promised and engaged
to me, that he would never leave me, unless I put him
away.
He seem'd very much concerned at it; for he had noj
rational Access to these poor people, seeing he did not
understand one Word of their Language, nor they one
Word of his. To remove this Difficulty, I told him,
Friday's Father had learned Spanijh, which I found he
also understood; and he mould serve him for an Inter-
preter; so he was much better satisfied, and nothing
could persuade him but he would stay to endeavour to
convert them; but Providence gave another and very-
happy Turn to all this.
I come back now to the first Part of his Objections.
When we came to the Etiglifomen, I sent for them all
together; and after some Accounts given them of what
I had done for them; viz, What necessary Things I had
provided for them, and how they were distributed;
which they were sensible of, and very thankful for; L
began to talk to them of the scandalous Life they ledr
and gave them a full Account of the Notice the Clergy-
man had already taken of it; and, arguing how unchri-
stian and irreligious a Life it was, I first asked them, if
they were married Men, or Batchelors. They soon ex-
plained their Condition to me, and shewed me that two
of them were Widowers, and the other three were
single Men, or Batchelors: I asked them, With what
Conscience they could take these Women, and lie with
them, as they had done, call them their Wives, and
have so many Children by them, and not be married^
lawfully to them?
They all gave me the Answer that I expected; *v?Ss.
That there was nobody to marry them that they
agreed before the Governor to keep them as their Wives
and to keep them, and own them, as their Wives; and
they thought, as Things stood with them, they were as
legall}*
legally married as if they had been married by a Parson,*
and with ail the Formalities in the World.
I told them, That no doubt they were married im
the Sight of God, and were bound in Conscience to
keep them as their Wives; but that the Laws of Mea-
being otherwise, they might pretend they were not mar-
ried, and so desert the poor Women and Children here-
after; and that their Wives, being poor desolate Wt>-
men, friendless and moneyless, would have no way t©
help themselves: I therefore told them, That unless I
was assured of their honest Intent, I could do nothing,
for them; but would take care, that what I did &'©ul4 *
be for the Women, and Children, without them; an4
that unless they would give some Assurances, that they
would many the Women, I could not think it was-
convenient they should continue together as Man, and
Wife; for that it was both scandalous to Men and of-
fensive to God, who they could not think would felefe
them, if they went on thus.
All this passed as I expected; and they told me
especially Will- Atkins^ who seemed now to speak for
the rest, That they loved their Wives as well as if fcbejp
had been born in their own native Country, and wtml&
not leave them upon any Account whatever; and they
did verily believe their Wives were as virtuous, and .as-
modest, and did to the utmost of their Skill, as maarck
for them, and for their Children, as any Women couM
possibly do; and they would not part with them *©is.
any Account: And William d-tkim, for his own Parti-
cular, added, If any Man would take him away, and*
offer to carry him home to Englavd, and make him
Captain of the best Man of War in the Navy, he wonki
not go with him, if he might not carry his Wise and
Children with him; and if there was a Clergyman in
the Ship, he would be married to her now, with al!
his Heart
This was just as I would have it 9 the Priest was
not with me at that Moment, but was not iar of:
So, to try him farther, I told him, I had a Clergymsn
with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next Morning; and bade him consider of
k, and talk with the rest; He said, As for himfelf, he
need not consider of it at all; for he was very ready to
do
do it, and was glad I had a Minister with me; arid
he believed they would be all willing also. J then told
him, That my Friend, the Minister, was a Frenchman ±
and could not speak Englijb; but that I would act the
Clerk between them. He never so much as a&ed me
whether he was a Papist or Protestant; which was,
indeed, what I was afraid of. But, J fay, they never
inquired about it. So we parted: I went back to my
Clergyman; and Will. Atkins Went in to talk with his
Companions. I desired the French Gentleman not to
say any thing to them, till the Business was thorough
ripe j and I told him what Answer the Men had given
me.
Before I went from their Quarter, they all came td
me, and told me, they had been considering what I had
said; that they were very glad to hear I had a Clergy-
man in my Company; and they were very willing to
give me the Satisfaction I desired, and to be formally
married as soon as I pleased; for they were far from
desiring to part from their Wives; and that they meant
nothing but what was very honest, when they chose
them. So I appointed them to meet me the next Morn-
ing; and that, in the mean Time, they mould let their
Wives know the Meaning of the Marriage-Law ,• and
that it was not only to prevent any Scandal, but also
to oblige them, that they ihould not forsake them*
whatever might happen.
The Women were easily made sensible of the Mean-
ing of the Thing, and were very well satisfied with it,
as, indeed, they had Reason to be; so they failed not
to attend all together, at my Apartment, the next
Morning, where I brought out my Clergyman: And
though he had not on a Ministers Gown, after the:
manner of Engla?id, or the Habit of a Priest, aster the
manner of France; yet having a black Vest, something
like a Cassock, with a Saih round it, he did not look
very unlike a Minister j and as for his Language, I was
Interpreter.
But the Seriousness of his Behaviour to them, and
the Scruples he made of marrying the Women, be-
cause they were not baptized, and professed Christians,
gave them an exceeding Reverence for his Person ,• and
these
there was no need after that to inquire whether he
was a Clergyman or no.
Indeed I was afraid his Scruple would have been car-
ried so far, as that he would not have married them at
all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to fay to him,
he resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily; and
at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he hai
first talked with the Men, and the Women too: And
though, at first, I was a little backward to it, yet at
last, I agreed to it with a good Will, perceiving the
Sincerity of his Design.
When he came to them, he let them know, that I had
acquainted him with their Circumstances, and with,
the present Design: That he was very willing to per-
form that Part of his Function, and marry them, as I
had desired; but that, before he could do it, he must
take the Liberty to talk with them : He told them,
That in the Sight of all different Men, and in the
Sense of the Laws of Society, they had lived all this
while in an open Adultery; and that it was true, that
nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectually se-
parating them from one another now, could put an End
to it; but there was a Difficulty in it too, with re-
spect to the Laws of Christian Matrimony, which he
was not fully satisfied about; <viz. That of marrying
one that is a profesied Christian, to a Savage, an Idola-
ter, and a Heathen, one that is not baptized; and yet
that he did not fee, that there was Time left for it, to
endeavour to persuade the Women to be baptized, or
to profess the Name of Christ, whom they had, he
doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they
could not be baptized.
He told me, He doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had but little Know-
ledge of God, or his Ways ; and therefore he could not
expect, that they had said much to their Wives on that
Head yet; but that unless they would promise him to
use their Endeavours with their Wires, to persuade
them to become Christians, and would as well as they
could instruct them in the Knowledge and Belief of
God that made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that
redeemed them, he could not marry them; for he
would have no Hand in joining Christians with Sa-
rages;
rages; nor was it consistent with the Principles of tTie
Christian Religion j and was, indeed, expresly fofcbid-
«!en M God's Law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered
it very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as near his
own Words as I could, only sometimes adding some-
thing of my own, to convince them how just it was,
and how I was of his Mind: And I always very faith-
fully distinguished between what I said from myself^
and what were the Clergyman's Words. They told
me, it was- very true what the Gentleman had said,
That they were but very indifferent Christians them-
selves,, and that they had .never talked to their Wives
ab-otst Religion : Lord, Sir, fays WilL Atkins, how mould
we teach them Religion? Why, we know nothing our-
selves: And besides, Sir, said he, should we go to talk
to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and Heaven, and HeU%
twould be to make them laugh at us ; and ask us, What
we belie\re ourselves t And if we mould tell them, we
believe all the Things that we speak of to them; such
as of good People going to Heaven, and wicked Peo-
ple to the Devil; they would ask us, Where we intended
to go ourselves, who believe all this, and yet are such
wicked Fellows, as we indeed are; Why, Sir, said Mil/.
\h enough to give them a Surfeit of Religion at first
Hearing: Folks must have some Religion themselves^
before they pretend to teach other People. Will. At-
kins, said I to him, tho' I am afraid what you fay
Isas too much Truth in it, yet can you not tell your
Wife, that she is in the Wrong r That there is a God*
and a Religion better than her own; that her Gods are
Idols -T that they can neither hear nor speak; that there
is a great Being that made all things, and that can de-
stroy all that he had made -r that he rewards the Good,
and punishes the Bad; that we are to be judged by him,
at last, for all we do here : You are not so ignorant, but
even Nature itself will teach you, that all this is true;
.and I am satisfy'd you know it all to be true, and be-
lieve it yourself.
That's true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what Face
can I say any thing to my Wife of all this, when she
will tell me immediately, it cannot be true I
Nqt
Not true, said I, What do you mean by that? Why»
Sir, said her She will tell me it cannot be true, that this
God (I (hall tell her of) can be just, or can punisti, or
reward, since I am not punished, and sent to the Devil,
that have been such a wicked CreatuTe as she knows I
have been, even to her, and to every body else; and
that I should be suffer'd to live, that have been always
acting & contrary to what I must tell her is good, and
to what I ought to have done.
Why truly, Atkim, said I, I am afraid thou speakest
too much Truth; and with that 1 let the Clergyman
know what Atkiu$ had said; for he was impatient to
know: O! said the Priest, Tell him there is one Thing
will make him the best Minister in the World to his
Wife 5 and that is Repentance; for none teach Repent-
ance like true Penitents: He wants nothing, but to
repent; and then he will be so much the better quali-
fied to instruct his Wife; he will be then able to tell her,
that there is not only a God, and that he is the just Re-
warder of Good and Evil; but that he is a merciful
Being, and, with infinite Goodness and Long-suffering,
forbears to punish those that offend; waiting to be gra-
cious > and willing not the Death of a Sinner, but rather
that he should return and Uve; that he often suffers
wicked Men to go on a long Time, and even reserves
Damnation to the general Day of Retribution: that it
is a dear Evidence of God, and of a future State, that
righteous Men receive not their Reward, or wicked
Men their Punishment, till they come into another
World; and this will lead him to teach his Wife the
Doctrine of the Resurrection, and of the dast judgment:
Let him but repent for himself, he will be an excellent
Preacher of Repentance to his Wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins who looked very seri-
ous all the while, and who, we could easdy perceive,
was more than ordinarily affected with it: When be-
ing eagisr, and hardly suffering me to make an End, I
knew all this, Master, fays Jie, and a great deai more;
but I han't the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife;
when God, and my own Conscience knows, . and my
Wife will he ah undeniable Evidence against ms, that I
have lived as if I had never heard of a God, or a future
State, or any thing about it: And to talk of my repent-
Y*L U. Wtt9. Q ing,
ing, alas (and with that he fetch'd a deep Sigh; and L
could fee that Tears stood in his Eyes) 'tis past all that
with me. Past it! Atkins, said I, What dost thou mean
by that? I know well enough what I mean, Sir, says
he; I .mean 'tis too late » and that is too true*
I told my Clergyman, word for word, what he said;
the poor zealous Priest (I must call him so; for be his
Opinion what it will, he had certainly a most singular
Affection for the Good of other Mens Souls; and it
would be hard to think he had not the like for his-
own ^ I fay, this zealous- affectionate Man) could not
refrain Tears also: But, recovering himself, he said to
me, Ask him but one Question, Is he easy, that it is too-
late, or is he troubled, and wishes it were* not so? I put
the Question fairly to Atkins; and he answered with a
great deal of Passion, How could any Man be easy in
a Condition that certainly must end in eternal Destruc-
tion? That he was far from being easy; but that, on
the contrary, he believed it would, one time or other
ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said II. Why, he said,
he believed he should, one time or- another, cut his own-
Throat to put an End to the Terror of it.
The Clergyman shook his Head, with a great Con*-
cem in his Face, when I told him all this ,* but, turning
quick to me upon it, said, If that be his Cafe, you may
assure him, it is not too- late; Christ will give him Re-
pentance: But pray, fays he, explain this to him,,That
as no Man is saved but by Christ,, and the Merit of his
Passion, procuring divine Mercy for him, how can it
be too late for any Man to receive Mercy.? Does he
think he is able to fin beyond the : Power or Reach of
Divine Mercy? Pray tell him, There may be a Time
when provoked Mercy will no longer strive, and when
God may refuse to hear; but that 'tis never too late* for
Men to ask Mercy; and we that are Christ's Servants
are commanded to preach Mercy at all Times, in; the-
Name of Jesus Christ, to all those, that sincerely repents
so that 'tis never too late to repent. I - :-
I told Atkins- all this, and he* heard met with> great
^Earnestness; but it seemed as if he turn'd off the Dis-
course to the rest; for he said to me, he would go and
hare some Talk with hi& Wife * So he went out awhile,
and
.and we talked to the rest. I perceived .they were all
stupidly ignorant, as to Matters of Religion; much as
J was when I went rambling away from my Father ,;
and yet that.there were none of them backward to hear
what had been said; and all of them seriously promised*
.that they would talk with their Wives about it, and to
-do their Endeavours to persuade.them to turn Chri-
stians.
The Clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported
what Answer they gave, but said nothing a good while;
.-but, at last, making his Head, We that are Christ's Ser-
vants, fays he, can go no further than to exhort and in-
ilruct; and when Men comply, submit to the Reproofj
<and promise what we ask, 't'is all we can do; we are
bound to accept their good Words: But, believe jne,
Sir, said he, whatever you may have known of the Life
of that Man you call William Atkins, I believe he is the
only sincere Convert among them j I take that Man to
, be a true Penitent; I won't despair of the rest; but that
Man is perfectly struck with the Sense of his past Life;
and I doubt not, but when he comes to talk Religion tp
his Wife, he will talk himself eiFectually into it; for
attempting to teach others, is sometimes the best way-
of teaching ourselves* I knew a Man, added he, who,
having nothing, but a summary Notion of Religion him-
sef, and being wicked and profligate, to the, last degree,
in his Life, made a thorough Reformation in himself,
by labouring to convert a J&w: And. if that poor At-
kins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to
his Wife, my Life for it, he talks himself into a thorough
Convert, makes himself a-Penitent: And who knows
what may follow?
Upon this Discourse however, and their promising,
as above, to endeavour to perfaade their Wives to em-
brace Christianity, he married the other three Couple;
but WilL Atkins and his Wife were not yet come in:
After this my Clergyman, , waiting awhile, was curious
>to know where Atkins was gone; and, turning to me,
fays , he, I intreat you, Sir, let us walk out of yonr
Labyrinth here, and look; I dare fay, we shall sind this
poor Man, somewhere or other, talking seriously witih
his Wife, and teaching her already something of Rdi-
^ion. I began to he; of the .fame Mind: Sq sve went
'* out
out together; and I carried him a Way which none
knew but myself, and where the Trees were so thick
set, as that it was not easy to see through the Thicket of
Leaves, and far harder to fee in, than to fee out; When
coming to the Edge of the Wood, I saw Jttiw, and
his tawny Savage Wife, sitting under the Shade of a
Bush, very eager in Discourse; I stopp'd short, till ray
Clergyman came up to me; and then, having (hewed
him where they were, we stood and looked very steadily
at them a good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
op to the Sun, and to every Quarter of the Heavens;
then down to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then to
himself, then to her, to die Woods, to the Trees. Now,
fays my Clergyman, you fee my Words are made good;
the Man preaches to her; mark him, now he is tell-
5ng her, that our God has made him, and her, and the
Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, the Woods, the Trees, 6fr.
I believe he is, said I: immediately we perceived With
Jtkins start up upon his Feet, fall down upon his
Knees, and lift op both his Hands: We suppose he said
something, but we could not hear him; it was too far
for that: He did not continue kneeling half a Minute,
but comes and sits down again by his Wife, and talk*
to her again. We perceived then the Woman very at-
tentive, but whether she said any thing or no, we
could not tell. While the poor Fellow was upon his
Knees, I could fee the Tears ran plentifully down my
CIergyman*s Cheeks; and I could hardly forbear my-
self: but it was a great Affliction to us both, that we
'were not near enough to hear any thing that passed be-
tween them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear
of disturbing them: So we resolved to see an End of
this Piece of still Conversation; and it spoke loud enough
to us, without the Help of Voice: He sat down again,
as I have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly to
her; and two or three times we could tee him embrace
her passionately j another time we saw him take out his
Handkerchief, and wipe her Eyes, and then kiss her
again, with a kind of Transport very unusual : And af-
ter several of these Things, we saw him on a sudden
lump up again, and lend her his Hand to help her upf
~~"" * when
when immediately leading her, by the Hand, a Step or
two, they both kneel'd down together, and continued
so about two Minutes.
My Friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, St. Paul, St. Paul! behold be prayetb: I was afraid
Jtkins would hear him; therefore I intreated him to
with-hold himself awhile, that we might see an End
of the Scene, which to me, I must confess, was the
most affecting, and yet the most agreeable, that ever I
saw in my Life. Well, he strove with himself and con-
tained himself for a while, but was in such Raptures of
Joy, to think that the poor Heathen Woman was be-
come a Christian, that he was not able to contain him-
self; he wept several Times; then throwing up his
Hands, and crossing his Breast, said over several things
ejaculatory, and by way of giving God Thanks for 10
miraculous a Testimony of the Success of our Endea-
vours; some he spoke softly, and I could not well
hear; others audibly, some in latin, some in French;
then two or three Times the Tears of Joy would in-
terrupt him, that he could not speak at all. But I
begg'd, that he would compose himself, and let us
more narrowly and fully observe what was before us,
which he did for a time, and the Scene was not ended
there yet: for, after the poor Man and his Wife were
risen again from their Knees, we observed he stood
talking still eagerly to her; and we observed by her Mo-
tion, that she Was greatly affected with what he said, by
her frequent lifting up her Hands, laying her Hand to
her Breast, and such other Postures, as usually exprese
the greatest Seriousness and Attention: This continued
about half a Quarter of an Hour, and then they walked
away too; so that we could sec no more of them in
that Situation.
I took this Interval to talk with my Clergyman; ind
first, I told him, I was glad to fee the Particulars we
had both been Witnesses to; that though I was hard
enough of Belief in such Cases* yet that I began to
think it was all very sincere here, both in the Man and
his Wife, however ignorant they might both be; and
I hoped such a Beginning would have yet a more happy
End; and who knows, said I, but these two may in
Time, by Instruction and Example, work upon some
4
of the others? Some of them, said he, turning quick
upon nie3 Ay, upon all of them; depend upon it, if
those two Savages (for he has been but little better, as
you relate it) should embrace Jesus Christ, they will
never leave till they work upon all -the rest; for true
Religion is naturally communicative; and he that is
once*made a Christian, will never leave a Pagan behind
hum, if he can help it. I own'd, it was a most Chri-
stian Principle to think so, and a Testimony of a true
Zeal, as well as a generous Heart in him. But, my
Friend, said I, will you give me Liberty to start one
Difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object the least
thing against that affectionate Concern, which you shew
for the turning the poor People from their Paganism to
the Christian Religion. But how does this comfort you,
ivhile these People are, in your Account, out of the
Pale of the Catholic Church; without which you be-
lieve there is no Salvation; so that you esteem these but
Heretics still; and for other Reasons, as effectually lost
as the Pagans themselves >
To this he answered with abundance of Candour,
•and Christian Chanty, thus; Sir, I am a Catholic of
the Roman Church, and a Priest of the Order of St. Be-
mdiily and I embrace all the Principles of the Roman
Faith: But yet, if you will believe me, and this I do
not speak in Compliment to you, or in respect to my
Circumstances, and your Civilities; I foy, nevertheless
I do not look upon you, who call yourselves Reformed,
without some Charity: I dare not say, though 1 know
it is our Opinion in general ; yet, I dare not fay, that
you cannot be saved; will by no means limit the Mercy
of Christ, so far as to think, that he cannot receive you
into the Bosom of his Church, in a manner, to us, im-
;perceivable, and which it is impossible for us so know;
and I hope you have the fame Charity for us: I pray
$aily for your being all restored to Christ's Church, by
whatsoever Methods, he, who is All-wife, is pleased to
-direct. In the mean Time, sure, you will allow it to
•consist with me, as a Roman, to .distinguish far between
-Si Protestant and a Pagan; between one that calls on
Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not think is
according to the true Faith; and a Savage, a Barbarian,
that knows no God, no Christ; no Redeemer at all;
and if you are not within the Pale of the Catholic
Church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it,
than those that know nothing at all of God, or his
Church: I rejoice therefore, when I fee this poor
Man, who, you fay, has been a Profligate, and almost
& Murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as
we suppose he did, though not fully enlightened; be*
lieving that God, from whom every such Work proi
ceeds,. will sensibly touch his Heart, and bring him to
the further Knowledge of the Truth in his own Time *
and if God shall influence this poor Man to convert
and instruct; the ignorant Savage his Wife, I can never
believe, that he shall be! cast away himself: And have I
not Reason then to rejoice, the nearer any are brought
so the Knowledge .of Christ,. though they may not be
brought quite home into, the Bosom of the Catholic
Church, just at the Time when. I may desire it; leav-
ing it to the Goodness of Christ to perfect his Work Ib
his own Time, and his own Way? Certainly I would
rejoice, if all the Savages in America were brought,
like this poor Woman, to pray to-God; tho' they were
to be all Protestants at first, rather than they should
continue Pagans and Heathens; iirrhly believing that
he who had bestowed that first Light upon 'em, would
further illuminate .them with a Beam of his. heavenly
Grace, and bring them into the Pale of his Church,
when he should fee good.
I was astonished at the Sincerity and Temper of this
ttuly pious Papist, as much as I Was oppressed by' the
Power of his Reasoning: And: it presently occurred
to my Thoughts, , thatirf such a'.Temper was janiver-
sal, we might be all Catholic- Christians*I whatever
Church, or particular Profession, we joined to, or
joined -in; that aT Spirit of Chanty would soon* work
us all up into right Principles; and, in a word, as he,
thought, diat the J^ke Charity would make us- all Ca-
tholics, so I told him, 1 believed, had all the Members
of his Church the like Moderation, they would soon be
•all Protestants*: 'And there we left that Part; for we
i»ev,er. disputed at all.;
However, I talked to him another way, and, taking
him! by the Hand, My Friend, said I, I wisli all the
.Clergy of the Raman Church were blessed with such
Mode.
Moderation, and an equal Share of your Charity $ I
an intirely of your Opinion; but I must tell you, that
if you should preach such Doctrine in Spain, or Italy,
they would put you into the Inquisition.
It may be so, said he, I know not what they might
do in Spain and Italy; but I will not say, they would
be the better Christians for that Severity; for I am sure
there is no Heresy in too much Charity.
Well, as Will, Atkins and his Wire were gone, our
Business there was over: So we Went back our own
Way ; and when we came back, we found them waiting
to be called in. Observing this, I asked my Clergy-
roan, if we should discover to him, that we had seen
him under the Bush, or no; and it was his Opinion we
should not; but that we should talk to him first, and
hear what he would iky to us: So we called him in
alone, nobody being in the Place but ourselves; and I
began with him thus:
Will. Atkins, said I, prithee what Education had you?
What was your Father?
W. A. A better Man than ever I shall be. Sir, my
Father was a Clergyman.
R. C. What Education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I
despised all Education, Instruction, or Correction, like
a Beast as I was.
R. C. It's true, Solomon fays, He that despises Reproof is
bruti/b.
W. A, Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed; I murder'd
my Father; for God's fake, Sir, talk no more about
that, Sir; I murder'd my .poor Father.
Trust* Ha! a Murderer *!
• Here the Priest started (for I interpreted every
Word as he spoke it) and looked pale: it seems
he believed that Will, had really kilPd his own
Father.
R. C, No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so:
Will. Atkins, explain yourself; you did not kill your
Father, did you, with your own Hands?
W. A. No, Sir; I did not cut his Throat; but I cut
the Thread of all his Comforts, and sliorten'd his Days;
I broke
I broke his Heart by the most ungrateful unnatural Re-
turn for the most tender affectionate Treatment that ever
Father gave, or Child could receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your Father, to
extort this Confession; I pray God give you Repentance
for it, and forgive you that, and all your other Sins %
but I asked you, because I fee, that though you have
not much Learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some
are, in Things that are good; that you have known
more of Religion a great deal than you practised.
W, A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the Confes-
sion that I make about my Father, Conscience does;
and whenever we come to look back upon our Lives,
the Sins against our indulgent Parents are certainly the
first that touch us; the Wounds they make, lie deepest;
and the Weight they leave, will lie heaviest upon the
Mind, of all the Sins we can commit
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me
Atkins; I cannot bear it.
W. A. You bear it, Master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every Shore, every Hill, nay, I
may fay, every Tree in this Istand is Witness to the
Anguim of my Soul, for my Ingratitude, and base
Usage of a good tender Father; a Father much like
yours, by your Description; and I murdered my Fa-
ther as well as you, Will. Atkins ; but think, for alt
that, my Repentance is short of yours too * by a great
deal.
* / would have said more, if I could have restrain d.
my Pajfiom; but I thought this poor Mans Re-
pentance <wat so much Jincerer than mitte, that I
<was going to leave off the Discourse, and retire;
for I uuas surprised ivith what he said; and thought
that instead os my going about to teach and in**
strucl him, the Man was made a Teacher and In*
siruBor to me, in a most surprising and unexpected
Manner.
I laid all this before the young Clergyman, whq'was
greatly affected with it, and said to me, Did I not,fey.
Sir, that when this Man was converted, he" would
Vol, II. R preach
preach to us all? I tell you, Sir, if this one Man he
made a true Penitent; here will be no need of me; he
will make Christians of all in the Island; But, hating
k little composed myself, I renewed my Discourse' with
Will. Atkins.
Bat, Will, said I, How comes the Sense of this Mat-
ter to touch you just now?
W. A, Sir, you have set me about a Work that has
struck a Dart through my very Soul ; I have been talk-
ing about God and Religion to my Wise, in order, as"
you directed me, to make a Christian of her j and she
has preached such a^Sermon to me, as I shall never for-
get while I live.
R. C. No, no; it is not your Wife has preached to
you; but when you were moving religious Arguments
to her, Conscience has slung them back upon you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a Force as is not to be
resisted.
R. C. Pray,^ Will, let us know what passed between-
ybu and your' Wife; for I know something of it al-
ready.
W~ A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a-full Ac-
count of it; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no
Tongue to express it; but let her have said what she
Will, and though 1 cannot give you an Account of it,
this" I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amend and
reform my Life
R. C. But tell us- some of it; How did you begin,
Will? For this has been an extraordinary Cafe, that is
certain ^ she has preached a Sermon, indeed, if she has
Wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why; . I first told her the Nature of our Laws
about Marriage,' and what the Reasons were, that Men
and Women were obliged to enter into such Compacts,,
as it was neither in the Power of one or other to break;
that otherwise Order and Justice could not be'maintain-
ed, and Men would run front their Wives, and aban-
don their Children, max confusedly with one another,
and neither Families be kept intire, or Inheritances be-
settled by a legal Descent. r , ,. ,
R. C You talk like a Civilian, Will Could yOu
make her understand what you • meant by Inheritance-'
families? They know no such thing among the
Savages,
Savages, hut inarry any-how, without any Regard to
Relation, Consanguinity, or Family; Brother and Sis-
ter; nay, as I have been tpld, even the Father .and
Daughter, and the Son and the Mother.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed; and my
Wife assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor
it; perhaps, for any farther ^Relations, they may not
be so fixact as we are; but she tells me;they never touch
one another in the near Relations you IpeaK of.
R. C. Well, what did ihe fay to what you told her r
W. A. She said, she liked it very well, and it was
much better than in her Country.
JR. C. But, did you tell her what Marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began ,all our Dialogue. I afk\d
her, If me would be married to me our way? Ske
asked me, W&at way rthat was? I >told Jier, Marriage
was appointed of God; and here we had a strange Talk
together, indeed, as ever Man and Wife had, I believe,
N. B. This Dialogue betwetn W. Atkins and his
Wife, as I took it down in Wr//i#g, just after be
told it me, was as follow:
Wife. Appointed by your God I Why^ have you 2
God in your Country?
W. A. Yes, my Dear; God is in every Country.
Wife. No your God in my Country; my Cpuntry
have the great old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unfit to shew you whp Go4
is; God is in Heaven, and made the Heaven and the
Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is.
Wife. No makee de Earth; no you God makee de
Earth; no make my Country.
* W. A. laughed a little &t her Expression of God
not making her Country.
Wife. No laugh: Why laugh me? This no Ting to
laugh f.
f He was justly reproved by his Wife 5 for she was
more serious than he, at ftst.
W. A. That's true indeed; I will not laugh any
more, my Dear.
Wife. Why you fay, you God make all?
R z W. Ar
W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole World,
and you, and me, and all Things; for he is the only
true God; there is no God but he; he lives for ever in
Heaven.
Wise. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true indeed; but I have been a wicked
Wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee
with any thing before, but have lived without God in
the World myself.
Wife. What have you de great God in you Country,
you no know him? No fay O to him ? No do good
Ting for him? That no impossible!
W. A. It is too true though, for all that: We live as
if there was no God in Heaven, or that he had no Power
on Earth.
Wise, But why God let you do so? Why he no makee
you good live?
W. A. It is all our own Fault.
Wife. But you fay me, he is great, much great, have
much great Power; can make kill when he will; why
he no makee kill when you no serve him? No fay O
to him? No be good Mans?
W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead, and I
ought to expect it; for I have been a wicked Wretch,
that is true; but God is merciful, and does not deal
with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for that
too?
W. A. No; indeed: I have not thank'd God for his
Mercy, any more than I have feared God for his
Power.
Wise. Then you God no God; me no think, believe,
he be such one, great much Power, strong; no makee
Jcill you, tho' you makee him much angry.
W. A. What! will my wicked Life hinder you from
believing in God! What a dreadful Creature am 11 And
what a sad Truth is it, that the horrid Lives of Chri-
stians hinder the Conversions of Heathens.
Wife. How me tink you have great much God * up
there, and yet no do well, no do good Ting? Cap \\$
{ell? Sure he no tell what you do,
* She pints us to Heayen*
W* A* Yes, yes, he knows and fees all Things \ he
hears us speak, sees wha* we do, knows what we
think, though we do not speak.
Wise. What I he no hear you swear, curse, speak the
great Damn?
W. A. Yes, yes? he hears it all.
Wise. Where be then the xnuchee great Power
strong?
W, A. He is merciful; that is all we can fay for it;
and this proves him to be the true God ; he is God,
and not Man; and therefore we are not consumed *
* Here Will. Atkins told us, He ivas flrueh with
Horror, to think honv he could tell bis Wife fi
clearly, that God fees, and hears, and knows the
secret Thoughts of the Heart, and all that *we do;
and yet that he had dared to do all the <vik
Things he had done.
Wife. Merciful! What you call dat?
W. A. He is our Father and Maker; and he pitie*
and spares us.
Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry
when you do wicked j then he no good himself, or no
great able,
W. A. Yes, yes, my Dear; he is infinitely good,
and infinitely great, and able to punish too; and some-
times, to shew his Justice and Vengeance, he lets fly
his Anger to destroy Sinners, and make Examples;
many are cut off in their Sins.
Wife. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you,
may be, that he no make you kill, so you make de Bar-
gain with him, you do bad Ting, he no be angry at
you, when he be angry at other Mans?
IV. A. No, indeed, my Sins are all Presumptions
upon his Goodness; and he would be infinitely just, if
he destroyed me, as he has done other Men.
Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead!
What you fay to him for that? You no tell him Yankee
for all that too!
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, that i&
true-,
Wist*
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better?
Isou say he makee you.
A* He made me as he made all the World; 'tis
I have deformed myself, and abused his Goodness, and
Jbave made myself an abominable Wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no makee
him angry $ I no do bad wicked Ting.
Here Will. Atkins said his Heart funk within him,
, to hear a poor untaught Creature dejire to he
taught to know God; and he such a wicked
Wretch, that he could not say one Word to her
about God, hut what the Reproach of his own
Carriage would make most irrational to her to
believe; nay, that already she could not belief
in Gody because he that was so wicked was not
destroyed.
W. A. My Dear, you mean, you wish I could teach
you to know God, not God to know you; for he
knows you already, and every Thought in your Heart..
Wife. Why then he know what I fay to you now;
he know me wish to know him: How mail me know
who makee me?
W. A. Poor Creature, he must teach thee; I can-
not teach thee: Y\\ pray to him to teach thee to
Jcnow him; and to forgive me, that I am unworthy to
teach thee.
The poor Fellow was in such an Agony at her de^
siring him to make her brow God, and her wish-
ing to know him, that, he said, he fell down on
his Knees before her, and prayed to God to en-
lighten her Mind with the saving Knowledge of
Jesus Christ, and to pardon his Sins, and accept
of his being the unworthy Instrument of instrucl*
ing her in the Principles of Religion; after which
he fat down by hir again and their Dialogue
went on.
}J. B. This was the Time when we saw him
kneel, down, and list up his Hands,
Wife,
Wise. What you put down the Knee for? What yoa
bold up the Hand for? What you fay? Who you fpeaic
to? What is that?
W. A. My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of my
Submission to him that made me: I said, O to him^
as you call it, and as you fay, your old Men do to
their Idol Ben amuck e; that is, I prayed to him.
Wife. What you fay O to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to open your Eyes, and your
Understanding* that you may know him, and be ac-
cepted by him.
Wife. Can he do that too?
W* A. Yes, he- can; he can do all Things.
Wise. But no he hear what you fay?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him; and pro-
mised to hear us.
Wise. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid
you? What f You hear him speak?
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak but he hit
revealed himself many Ways to us.
Here he was at a great Loss to make her understand*
that God had revealed himself to us by his Word %
and what his Word was: But, at last he told it her
thus.
W. A. God has spoken to fonre good Men in former
Days, even from Heaven, by plain Words; and God
has inspired good Men, by his Spirit; and they have
written all his Laws down in a Book.
Wife. Me no understand that: Where is Book?
W. A. Alas! my poor Creature, I have not this Book?
but, I hope, I mail, one time other, get it for you
to read it.
Here he embraced her with great Assertion; but wit&
inexpressible Grief that he had not a Bible.
Wise. But how you makee me know, that God teachee"
them to write that Book?
W. A. By the fame Rule that we know him to be
God.
Wife* What Rule, what Way you know I
3 IF. A,
W, A. Because he teaches and commands nothing
but what is good, righteous, and holy; and tends to
make us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy;
and because he forbids,' and commands us to avoid ail
this is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its Con*
sequences.
Wife. That me would understand, that me fain fee;
if he reward all good Thing, punish all wicked Thing,
he teachce all good Thing, forbid all wicked Thing,,
lie make all Thing, he give all Thing; he hear me
When I say O to him, as you go do just now; he
makee me good, if I wish be good; he spare me, no
makee kill me, when I no be good; all this you fay
he do; yes, he be great God; me take, think, believe,
him be great God; me fay O to him too, with you,
my Dear.
Here the poor Man said he could forbear no longer;
but, raising her up, made her kneel by him; and he
prayed to God aloud, to instruct her in the Knowledge
of himself, by his Spirit; and that by some good Pro-
vidence, if possible, she might some time or other come
to have a Bible, that she might read the Word of God,
and be taught by it to know him.
This was the Time that «ive faiv him lift her up by
ihe Handy and fan) him kneel du~wn by her, as
above.
They had several other Discourses, it seems, aster
this, too long to set down here; and particularly she
made him promise, That since he confessed his own
Life had been a wicked abominable Course os Provo-
cation against God, that he would reform it, and not
make God angry any more, lest he should make him
dead, as she called it, and then ihe should be left alone,
and never £>e taught to know this God better; and lest
he should be miserable, as he had told her wicked
Men mould be after Death.
This was a strange Account, and very affecting to us
both, but particularly to the young Clergyman j he was
indeed wonderfully surprised with it; but under the
greatest Affliction imaginable, that he could not talk to
her; that he could not speak Englijh to make her un-
derstand him; and as she spoke but very broken Eng-
lift he could not understand her. However he turn'd
himself to me, and told me, that he believed there mud
be more to do with this Woman than to marry her;
I did not understand him at first, but at length he ex-
plained himself; <viz. That Ihe ought to be baptiz'd.
I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was for
going about it presently: No, no; hold Sir, said he,
though I would have her baptiz'd by all Means, yet I
must observe, That Will. Atkins, her Husband, has, in-
deed, brought her in a wonderful manner to be willing
to embrace a religious Life; and has given her just Ideas
of the Being of a God, of his Power, Justice, and Mercy;
yet I desire to know of him, if he has said any thing
to her of Jesus Christ, and of the Salvation of Sinners j
of the Nature of Faith in him, and the Redemption by
him; of the Holy Spirit, the Resurrection, the last
Judgment, and a future State.
I called Will. Atkins again, and asked him; but the
poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears, and told us,
He had said something to her of all those Things, but
that he was himself so wicked a Creature, and his own
Conscience so reproached him with his horrid ungodly
Life, that he trembled at the Apprehensions, that her
Knowledge of him mould lessen the Attention she should
give to those Things, and make her rather contemn
Religion, than receive it: But he was assured, he said,
that her Mind was so disposed to receive due Impres-
sions of all those Things, that if I would but discourse
with her, she would make it appear to my Satisfaction^
that my Labour would not be lost upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and, placing myself as
Interpreter between my religious Priest and the Woman,
I intreated him to begin witk her; but sure such a
Sermon was never preached by a Popish Priest in these
latter Ages of the World; and, as I told him, I thought
he had all the Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sinceriti-
es a Christian, without the Errors of a Roman Catholic;
and that I took him to be such a Clergyman, as the
Roman Bishops were, before the Church of Rome as-
sumed spiritual Sovereignty over the Consciences of
Men.
In a word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace
the Knowledge of Christ, and of Redemption by him,
Vol, IL S not
not with Wonder and Astonishment only, as she did the-
first Notions of a God, but with Joy and Faith, with*
an Affection, and a surprising Degree of Understand-
ing, scarce to be imagined, much less to be expressed;
and, at her own Request, me was baptiz'd.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I intreated
Kim, that he would perform that Office with some-
Caution, that the Man might not perceive he was of
the Roman Church, if possible; because of other ill
Consequences which* might attend a Difference among
us in that very Religion* which- we were instructing^
the other in. He told me, That as he had no conse-
crated Chapel, nor proper Things for the Office, I should
fee he would do it in a manner, that I should not know
by it, that he was a Roman Catholic, myself, if J had
not known it before : And so he did; for, saying only
some Words over to himself in Lati?t> which I could
not understand, he pour'd a whole Dim full of Water
upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing, in French very
lo lid MART; which was the Name her Husband de-
sired me to give her, for I was> her Godfather, / has"
ti%e thee in the- Name of the. Father, ami of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost; so that' none could know any thing
by it, what Religion he was of: He gave the Bene-
diction afterwards in Latin; but either Will. Atkins did
not know but it was in French, or else did not take no-
tice of it at that Time.
As^soon as this was over, he married them; and af-
ter the Marriage was over, he turned himself to Will*
Atkins^ and in a. very affectionate manner exhorted
him, not only to* persevere in that good Disposition*
he was in, but to support the Convictions that were
upon him, by a Resolution to reform his Life; told
him, it was in vain to fay he repented, if he did not
forsake his Crimes y. represented to him, how God had
honoured him with being the Instrument of bringing
his Wife to the Knowledge of the. Christian Religion;
and that he should be careful he did not dishonour the-
Grace of God; and that, if he did, he would fee the
Heathen a better Christian than, himself; the Savage
converted, and the Instrument cast away.
He said a great many good things to them both, and:
then recommended them, in a few Words, to God's
Good-
<$3oodness, gave them the Benediction again, I repeating
vevery thing to them in English: And thus ended jhe
Ceremony. Xthink rit was the most pleasant agreeable
.Day to me that ever I passed in my whole Life.
But my Clergyman had not done yet; his Thoughts
hung continually upon the Conversion of the 37 Sa-
vages; and fain he would have stayed upon the Island,
to have undertaken it ; but I convinced him, First, that
his Undertaking was impracticable in itself; and zdly9
*that, perhaps, I would put it into a Way of being done,
in his Absence, to-his Satisfaction; of which, by-aid-
i>y.
Having thus brought die Astair of the Island to a
narrow Compass, 1 was preparing to go on board the
Ship, when the young Man, whom <I had taken out
of the famished Ship's Company, came to me, and told
me, He understood I had a Clergyman with me; and
that I had caused the Englijbmen to be married to the
Savages, whom they called Wives; that he had a
Match too, which he desired might be finished befote
>I went, between two Christians j >which, he hoped*
Avould not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young Woman who was
.his Mother's Servant; for there was no other Christian
Woman on the Island; so I began to persuade him not
to do any thinjg of that kind rashly, or because 2\e
found himself in this solitary Circumstance; ll repre-
sented, that he had some considerable Sabstagce in the
World, and good Friends, as I understood by himselfj
.and by his Maid also; that the Maid was not only poor,
and a Servant, but was unequal to him, she being z6
or 27 Years old, ,and he not above ,17 or j8 ; ethat he
might, very .probably, with my Assistance, make a Re-
move from this Wilderness, and come into his own
.Country again ; . and that then it wou&Lhe a thousand to
one but he would repent his Choice; and the Dislike
of that Circumstance might %bc .disadvantageous to
both. I was going to fay more, but he interrupted
.me, smiling; ami rtojd me, with a great deal of Mo-
desty, that I mistook in;my Guesses; that he had no*
thing of that kind in his Thoughts, his present Cir-
cumstances being melancholy and disconsolate enough 5
and he was very glad to hear, that I had Thoughts of
S 2 putting
putting them in a Way to see their own Country
again 5 and that nothing should have set him upon
staying there, but that the Voyage I was going was so
exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him
quite out of the Reach of all his Friends; that he had
nothing to desire of me, but that I would settle him in
some little Property in the Island where he was; give
him a Servant or two, and some sew Necessaries, and
he would settle himself here like a Planter, waiting the
good time when, if ever I returned to England^ I would
redeem him, and hoped 1 would not be unmindful
of him when I came to England; that he would give
me some Letters to his Friends in London, to let them
know how good I had been to him, and what Part
of the World, and what Circumstances, I had left him
in: And he promised me, that whenever I redeemed
him, the Plantation, and all the Improvements he had
made upon it, let the Value be what it would, should
be wholly mine.
His Discourse was very prettily delivered, consider-
ing his Youth; and was the more agreeable to me, be-
cause he' told me positively the Match was not for
himself. I gave him all possible Assurances, that, if I
lived to come safe to England, I would deliver his
Letters, and do his Business effectually; and that he
might depend I would never forget the Circumstances I
left him in; but still I was impatient to know who
was the Person to be married: Upon which he told me,
it was my Jack of all Trades, and his Maid Susan.
I was most agreeable surprised, when he named the
Match; for, indeed, I had thought it very suitable.
The Character of that Man I have given already; and
as for the Maid, stie was a very honest, modest, sober,
and religious young Woman; had a very good Share of
Sense; was agreeable enough in her Person; spoke very
handsomely, and to the Purpose; always with Decency
and good Manners, and not backward to speak when
any thing required it, or impertinently forward to
speak when it was not her Business 5 very handy
and housewifely in any thing that was before her; an
excellent Manager, and fit, indeed, to have been Go-
verness to the whole Island j she knew very wejl how
to
to behave herself to all kind of Folks me had about
her, and to better, if she had found any there.
The Match being proposed in this Manner, we mar-
ried them the fame Day; and as I was Father at the
Altar, as I may fay, and gave her away, so I gave her
a Portion ; • for I appointed her and her Hu/band a
handsome large Space of Ground for their Plantation;
and, indeed this Match, and the Proposal the young
Gentleman made to me, to give him a small Property
in the Island, put me upon parcelling it out among
them, that they might not quarrel afterwards about
their Situation.
This sharing out the Land to them I left to Will.
Jtkinsy who, indeed, was now grown a most sober,
grave, managing Fellow j perfectly reformed, exceed-
ing pious and religious; and, as far as I may be al-
lowed to speak positively in such a Case, I verily be-
lieve, was a true, sincere Penitent.
He divided Things so justly, and so much to every
one's Satisfaction, that they only desired one general
Writing under my Hand for the Whole; which I
caused to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them,
setting out the Bounds and Situation of every Man's
Plantation, and testifying, that I gave them thereby,
severally, a Right to the whole Possession and Inheri-
tance of the respective Plantations or Farms, with their
Improvements, to them and their Heirs; reserving all
the rest of the Istand as my own Property, and a cer-
tain Rent for every particular Plantation, after eleven
Years, if I, or any one from me, or in my Name,
came to demand it, producing an attested Copy of the
fame Writing.
As to the Government and Laws among them, I told
them, I was not capable of giving them better Rules
than they were able to give themselves; only made
them promise me to live in Love and good Neigh-
bourhood with one another: And so I prepared to
leave them.
One Thing I must not omit; and this is, that being
now settled in a kind of Commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much Business in Hand, it was but
odd to have seven-arid-thirty Indium live in a Nook of
the Island, independent, and, indeed, unemployed; for,
except-
excepting the providing themselves Food, which they
&ad Difficulty enough in too, sometimes, they had no
manner of Business or Property to manage: I propos'd
•therefore to the Governor Spaniard, that he should go
to them with Friday s Father, and propose to them to
remove, and either plant for themselves, or take them
into their several Families as Servants, to be maintained
€or their Labour, but without being absolute Slaves;
for I would not admit them to make them Slaves by
Porce, by any means, .because they had their Liberty
given by Capitulation, and, as it were, Articles of Sur-
render, which they ought not to break.
They most: willingly embraced the Proposal, and
came all very chearful along with him ; so we allotted
them Land, and Plantations, which three or four ac-
cepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed as Ser-
vants in the several Families we had settled; and thus
my Colony was in a manner settled, as follows: The
Spaniards possessed my original Habitation, which was
•the capital City, and extended their Plantation all along
the Side of the Brook, which made the Creek that I
3iave so often described, as far as my JBower; and as
they increased their Culture, it went always Eastward;
the English lived in the North-East Part, where Will.
Atkins and his Comrades began, and come on South-
ward, and South-West, towards the back Part of the
Spaniards ; and every Plantation had a great Addition
of Land to take in, if they found ^Occasion; so that
they need not jostle one another for want of Room.
All the West-End of the Island was left uninhabited,
-that if any of the Savages should come on more there,
&nly for their usual customary Barbarities, they might
rfeom'fe and go ; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would
disturb them; and no doubt but they were often "ashore,
asd went away again; for I never heard, that the
^Planters were ever attacked and disturbed any more.
It now came into my Thought*, that I had hinted
to my Friend the Clergyman, that the Work of con-
certing the Savages might, ,perhaps, be set on foot in
Itis Absence, to his Satisfaction: And I told him, that
now I thought it was put in a fair Way 5 for the Sa-
rages being thus divided among the Christians, if. they
-.would but every one of them do their .Part with those
2 whidi
which came under their Hands, I hoped it might have
a very good Effect,
He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do
their Part; but how, says he, shall we obtain that of
them? I told him, we could call them all together,
and leave it in Charge with them, or go to them one.
by one, which he thought best; so we divided it; he -
to speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists j and I
to the English, who were all Protestants; and we recom-
mended it earnestly to them, and made them promise,
that they would never make any Distinction os Papist
or Protestant, in their exhorting the Savages to turn
Christians ; but teach them of the general Knowledge of
the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and
they likewise promised us, that they would never have
any Differences or Disputes, one with another, about
Religion.
When I came to WUL Atkins's House (I may call it sa,
for such a House, or such a Piece of Basket-work, I
believe, was not standing in the World again! I fay,,
when I came thither) I found the young Woman I
have mentioned above*, and William Atkins's Wife*,
were become Intimates; and this prudent religious
young Woman, had perfected the Work WUL Atkins had
begun; and thought it was not above four Days after
what I have related, yet the new-baptized Savage Wo-
man was made such a Christian as I have seldom heard
os any like her, in all my Observation, or Conversation
in the World
It came next into my Mind, in the Morning* before
I went to them, that among all the needful Things
I had to leave with, them, I had not left a Bible; in,
which I shewed myself less considering for them, than
my good Friend the Widow was for me, when she
sent me the Cargo of1 100 /. from Listen, where she
packed up three Bibles and a Prayer-Book. However,
the good Woman's. Charity had a greater Extent than-
ever she imagined; for they were reserved for the
Comfort and Instruction of those that made much bet-
er Use of them than I had done.
I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when
I came to William Atkins's Tent or House, I found
the young Woman, and Atkins's baptized Wi$$ had
been
been discoursing of Religion together; (for William At-
kins told it me, with a great of Joy $) I aslced if they
were together now I and he said, Yes; so I went into
the House, and he with me, and we found them toge-
ther very earnest in Discourse: O, Sir, says William
Atkins, when God has Sinners to reconcile to himself,
and Aliens to bring home, he never wants a Messen-
ger: My Wife has got a new Instructor; I knew I
was unworthy, as I was uncapable of that Work; that
young Woman has been sent hither from Heaven; she
is enough to convert a whole Island of Savages. The
young Woman bluslied, and rose up to go away, but
I desired her to sit still; I told her she had a good
Work upon her Hands, and I hoped God would bless
her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had
any Book among them, though I did not ask; but I put
my Hand in my Pocket, and pulled out my Bible; Here,
said I to Atkins, I have brought you an Assistant, that,
perhaps, you had not before. The Man was so con-
founded, that he was not able to speak for some time;
but, recovering himself, he takes it with both his
Hands; and, turning to his Wife, Here, my Dear, fays
he, did not I tell you, our God, though he lives above,
could hear what we said? Here is the Book I prayed
for, when you and I kneeled down under the Bush;
now God has heard us, and sent it. When he had said
thus, the Man fell into such Transports of a paflionate
Joy, that between the Joy of having it, and giving God
Thanks for it, the Tears ran down his Face like a
Child that was crying.
The Woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a Mistake, that none of us were aware of;
for she firmly believed God had sent the Book upon her
Husband's Petition: It is true, that providentially it
was so, and might be taken so in a consequent Sense;
but I believed it would have been no difficult Matter, at
that Time, to have persuaded the poor Woman to have
believed, that an express Messenger came from Heaven,
on purpose to bring that individual Book; but it was
too serious a Matter, to suffer any Delusion to take
place: so I turned to the young Woman, and told
her, We did not d-v.re to impose upon the new Con-
vert.,
fcert, in her first, aud - more ignorant understanding of
Things; and begged her to explain to her, that God
may be very properly said to answer our Petitions,
when, in the Course os his Providence, such Things
are, in a particular Manner, brought to pass, as we pe-
titioned for; but we do not expect Returns from Hea-
ven, in a miraculous and particular manner; and that
it is our Mercy, that it is not so.
This the young Woman did afterwards effectually;
so that there was, I assure you, no Priestcraft used
here; and J stiould have thought it one of the most
unjustifiable Frauds in the World, to have had it so j
but the Surprise of Joy upon Will, Atkins > is really not
to be expressed; and there, we may be sure, was
no Delusion: Sure no Man was ever more thankful ia
the World for any thing of its Kind, than he was for
this Bible; and, I believe, never any Man was glad of
a Bible from a better Principle; and though he had
been a most profligate Creature, desperate, headstrong*
outrageous, furious, and wicked, to a great Degree;
yet this Man is a standing Rule to us all for the well in*
jstxucting Children; viz. that Parents should never give
over to teach and instruct, or ever despair of the Suc-
cess of their Endeavours, let the Children be ever fo>
obstinate, refractory, or, to Appearance, insensible of
Instruction; for, if ever God in his Providence touches
the Consciences of such, the Force of their Education
returns upon them, and the early Instruction of Pa-
rents is not lost; though it may have been many Years
laid asleep; but, some Time or other, they may find
the Benefit of it.
Thus it 4 was with this poor Man, however ignorant
lie was, or divested of Religion and Christian Know-
ledge. He found he had some to do with now more ig-
norant than himself; and that the least Part of the In-
struction of his good Father, that could now come to>
his Mind, was of Use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, How his
Father used to insist much upon, the inexpressible Value
of the Bible; the Privilege and Bleffing of it to Nations,
Families, and Persons; but he never entertained the
least Notion of the Worth o£ it, till now $ when, beine
Vol. II. W.19. T t|
to talk to Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted
the Help of the written Oracle for his Assistance.'
The young Woman was very glad of it also, for the
present Occasion, though she had one; and so had the
-Youth on board our Ship, among the Goods, which
were not yet brought on Ihore. And now, having said
so many Things of this young Woman, I cannot omit
telling one Story more of her and myself, which has
something in it very informing and remarkable.
I have related, to what Extremity the poor young
Woman was reduced; how her Mistress was starved
to Death, and did die, on board that unhappy Ship we
met at Seas and how the whole Ship's Company be-
ing reduced to the last Extremity, the Gentlewoman,
and her Son, and this Maid, were first hardly used, as
to Provisions ; and, at last, totally neglected and starv-
ed; that is to fay, brought to the last Extremity of
Hunger.
One Day, being discoursing with her upon the Ex-
tremities they suffered, I asked her, if she could de-
scribe, by what she felt, what it was to starve, and
how it appeared? She told me, she believed she could;
and she told her Tale very distinctly thus:
First, Sir, said she, we had for some Days fared ex-
ceeding hard, and suffered very great Hunger; but
now, at last, we were wholly without Food, of any
Kind, except Sugar, and a little Wine, and a little Wa-
ter. The first Day, after I had received no Food at all,
I found myself towards Evening, first empty and sickifh
at my Stomach; and nearer Night, mightily inclined
to yawning, and sleepy; I laid down on a Couch, in
the great Cabin, to sleep; and slept about three Hours,
and awaked a little refreshed, having taken a Glass .of
Wine when I lay down; after being about three Hours,
awake, it being about five o'Clock in the Morning, I
found myself empty, and my Stomach sickifh again,
and laid down again; but could not sleep at all, being
very faint and ill; and thus I continued all the second
Day, with a strange Variety, first hungry, then sick
again, with Reachings to vomit; the second Night,
being obliged to go to Bed again, without any Food
more than a Draught of fair Water, and being asleep,
I dreamed
I dreamed I was at Barbadœs, and that the Market was
mightily stock'd with Provisions; that I bought some
for my Mistress, and went and dined very heartily.
I thought my Stomach was as full after this, as i t
would have been after, or at, a good Dinner; but when
I awaked, I was exceedingly funk in my Spirits to find
myself in the Extremity of Famine: The last Glass of
Wine we had, I drank, and put Sugar into it, because
of its having some Spirit to supply Nourishment; but
there being no Substance in the Stomach for the digest-
ing Office to work upon, I found the only Effect of the
Wine was, to raise disagreeable Fumes from the Stomach
into the Head; and f lay, as they told me, stupid and
senseless, as one drunk, for some time.
The third Day in the Morning, after a Night of
strange and confused inconsistent Dreams, and rather
dozing than sleeping, I awaked, ravenous and furious
with Hunger; and I question, had not my Understand*
ing returned, and conquered it; 1 fay, I question whe-
ther, if 1 had been a Mother, and had had a little Child
with me, its Life would have been safe, ot not.
This lasted about three Hours; during which Time
I was twice raging mad, as any Creature in Bedlam, as
my young Master told me, and as he can now inform
you.
In one of these Fits of Lunacy, or Distraction, whe-
ther by the Motion of the Ship, or some Slip of my Foot,
I know not; I fell down, and struck my Face against
the Corner of a Pallet-bed, in which my Mistress lay;
and with the Blow, the Blood gushed out of my Nose;
and the Cabin-boy bringing me a little Bason, I sat
down, and bled into it a great deal; and as the Blood
ran from me, I came to myself; and the Violence of
the Flame, or the Fever I was in, abated, and so did
the ravenous Part of the Hunger.
Then I grew sick, and reached to vomit, but could
not; for I had nothing in my Stomach to bring up:
After I had bled some time, I swooned, and they all
Relieved I was dead ;-but I came to myself soon after,
and then had a most dreadful Pain in my Stomach, not
to be described; not like the Cholic; but a gnawing
eager Pain for Food; and towards. Night it went off
with a kind of earnest Wishing or Longing for Food;
T z some-
something like, as I suppose, the Longing of a Wo-
man with Child. I took another Draught of Water,
with Sugar in it, but my Stomach loathed the Sugar,
and brought it all up again: Then I took a Draught of
Water without Sugar, and that stayed with me; and
laid me down upon the Bed, praying most heartily, that
at would please God to take me away; and composing
my Mind in Hopes of it, I slumbered awhile; and then
waking, thought myself dying, being light with Va-
pours from an empty Stomach, I recommended my
Soul to God, and earnestly wimed, that somebody
would throw me into the Sea.
All this while my Mistress lay by me, just, as I
thought, expiring; but bore it with much more Pati-
ence than I, and gave the last Bit of Bread she had to
her Child, my young Master, who would not have
taken it, but ihe obliged him to eat it ; and, I believe,
it saved his Use.
Towards the Morning I slept again; and first, when
I awaked, I fell into a violent Passion of Crying; and,
after that, had a second Fit of violent Hunger, so that
I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful Condition;
liad my Mistress been dead, as much as I loved her, I
am certain, I should have eaten a Piece of her Flesh with
as much Relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I did the
Plesh of any Creature appointed for Food; and, once
or twice, I was going to bite ray own Arm. At last,
I saw the Bason, in which was the Blood I had bled
at my Nose the Day before; I ran to it, and swallowed
5t with such Haste, and such a greedy Appetite, as if I
liad wondered nobody had taken it before, and afraid
it mould be taken from me now.
Though after it was down, the Thoughts of it filled
ane with Horror $ yet it checked the Fit of Hunger;
and I drank a Draught of fair Water, and was compos'd
and refiefned for some Hours after it. This was the
fourth Day, and thus I held it till towards Night, when
within the Compass of three Flours, I had all these seve-
ral Circumstances over again, one after another; viz.
iick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, Pain in the Stomach, then
ravenous again, then sick again, then lunatic, then cry-
ing, then ravenous again, and so every Quarter of an
Hour; and my Strength wasted exceeding. At Night
I kid me down, having no Comfort, but in the Hope,
that I should die before Morning.
All this Night I had no Sleep, but the Hunger was
now turned into a Disease; and I had a terrible Cholic
and Griping: Wind, instead of Food, having found its
Way into the Bowels $ and in this Condition I lay till
Morning, when I was surprised a little with the Crie*
and Lamentations of my young Master, who called out
to me, that his Mother was dead. I listed myself up a
little, for I had not Strength to rise, but sound (he was
not dead, though stie was able to give very little Signs
of Life.
I had then such Convulsions in my Stomach, for
want of some Sustenance, that I cannot describe them;
with such frequent Throes and Pangs of Appetite, that
nothing but the Tortures of Death can imitate: And
this Condition I was in, when I heard the Seamen above
cry out, A Sail, A Sail, and halloo and jump about a«
if they were distracted.
I was not able to get off from the Bed, and my Mi-
stress much less ,* and my Master was so sick, that I
thought he had been expiring; so we could not open
the Cabin Door, or get any Account what it was that
occasioned such a Combustion; nor had we any Con-
versation with the Ship's Company for two Days ; they
having told us they had not a Mouthful of any thing
to eat in the Ship: And they told us afterwards, they
thought we had been dead.
It was this dreadful Condition we were in, when you
were sent to save our Lives : And how you found us,
Sir, you know as well as I, and better too.
This was her own Relation, and is such a distinct
Account of starving to Death, as, I confess, I never
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me: I
am the rather apt to believe it to be a true Account,
because the Youth gave me an Account of a good Part
of it; though I must own, not so distinct, and so feel-
ingly, as his Maid; and the rather, because, it seems,
his Mother fed him at the Price of her own Life: But
the poor Maid, though, her Constitution being stronger
than that of her Mistress, who was in Years, and a
weakly Woman too, lhe might struggle harder with
it; May, the poor Maid might be supposed to feel the
4 Extremity
Extremity something sooner than her Mistress, \vh<*
might be allowed to keep the last: Bits something Ion*
ger than she parted with any to relieve the Maid. No
question, as the Cafe is here related, if our Ship, or
some other, had not so providentially met them, a few
Days more would have ended all their Lives, unless
they had prevented it by eating one another; and even
that, as their Cafe stood, would have served them but
a little while, they being 500 Leagues from any Land;
or any Possibility of Relief, other than in the miraculous
manner it happened: But this is by the way. I re-
turn to my Disposition os Things among the People.
And First, It is to be observed here, That, for many
Reasons, I did not think sit to let them know any
thing of the Sloop I had framed, and which I thought
of setting up among them; for I sound, at least at my
first Coming, such Seeds of Divisions among them,
that I saw it plainly, had I set up the Sloop, and left
it among them, they would, upon very light Dis-
gust, have separated, and gone away from one ano-
ther; or, perhaps, have turned Pirates, and so made
the Island a Den of Thieves, instead of a Plantation of
sober and religious People, as I intended it to be; nor
did I leave the two Pieces of Brass Cannon that I had
on board, or the two Quarter-deck Guns, that my Ne-
phew took extraordinary, for the fame Reason: I
thought they had enough to qualify them for a defen-
sive War against any that should invade them; but I
was not to set them up for an offensive War; or to
encourage them to go abroad to attack others, which
in the End would only bring Ruin and Destruction
upon themselves, and all their Undertakings: I re-
served the Sloop, therefore, and the Guns, for their
Service another way; as I mall observe in its Place.
I have now done with the Island: I left them all
in good Circumstances, and in a flourishing Condition,
and went on board my Ship again the fifth Day of May,
having been five-and-twenty Days among them; and,
as they were all resolved to stay upon the Island till I
came to remove them, I promised to send some fur-
ther Relief from the Brafih, if I could possibly find an
Opportunity; and particularly, I promised to send them
some Cattle; such as Sheep, Hogs, and Cows: For, as to
the two Cows and Calves, which I brought from Eng-
tatul, we had been obliged, by the Length, of our
Voyage, to kill them at Sea, for want of Hay to feed 'em.
The next Day, giving them a Salute of five Guns at
Parting, we set Sail, and arrived at the Bay of All-
Saints, in the Brafils, in about 22 Days; meeting no-
thing remarkable in our Passage, but this, that about
three Days, after we failed, being becalmed, and the
Current setting strong to the E. N. E. running, as it
were, into a Bay or Gulph, on the Land-side, we were
driven something out of our Course; and once or twice
our Men cry'd Land, to the Westward; but whether it
was the Continent or Islands, we could not tell by any
means.
But the third Day, towards Evening, the Sea smooth,
and the Weather calm, we saw the Sea, as jt were,
covered, towards the Land, with something very black,
not being able to discover what it was; but, after
some time, our Chief Mate going up the Main Shrouds
a little Way, and looking at them with a Perspective,
cry'd out, it was art Army. I could not imagine what
he meant by an Army, and spoke a little hastily, calling
the Fellow a Fool, or some such Word: Nay, Sir, says
he, don't be angry; for it is an Army, and a Fleet too;
for I believe there are a thousand Canoes, and you may
fee them paddle along, and they are coming towards us
too, apace, and full of Men.
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my
Nephew the Captain; for he had heard such terrible
Stories of them in the Island, and having never been
in those Seas before, that he could not tell what to
think of it, but said two or three times, we (hould all
be devoured. I must confess, considering we were
becalm'd, and the Current set strong towards the Shore,
I liked it the worse: However, I bade him not be
afraid, but bring the Ship to an Anchor, as soon as we
came so near as to know, that we must engage them.
The Weather continued calm, and they came on
apace towards us; so I gave Orders to come to an An-
chor, and furl all our Sails. As for the Savages, I told
them, they had nothing to fear from them but Fire; and
therefore they should get their Boats out, and fasten them,
one close by the Head, and the other by the Stern, and
man
man them both well, 'and wait the Issue in that Po*
sture: This I did, that the Men in the Boats might
be ready, with Sheets and Buckets, to put out any
Fire these Savages might endeavour to six upon the
Outside of the Ship.
In this Posture we lay by for them, and in a little
while they came up with us; but never was such a
horrid Sight seen by Christians: My Mate was much
mistaken in his Calculation of their Number, I mean of
a thousand Canoes; the most we could make of them
when they came up, being about a hundred and
twenty-six; and a great many of them too; for some
of them had sixteen or seventeen Men in them, some
more; and the least six or seven.
When the came nearer to us, they seemed to be
struck with Wonder and Astonishment, as at a Sight
which they had, doubtless, never seen before; nor
eould they, at first, as we afterwards understood, know
what to make of us. They came boldly up however,
very near to us, and seemed to go about, to row round
us; but we called to our Men in the Boats, not to let
them come too near them.
This very Order brought us to an Engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six of their
large Canoes came so near our Longboat, that our Men
beckoned with their Hands to them to keep back;
which they understood very well, and went back; but
at their Retreat about 500 Arrows came on board us
from those Boats; and one of our Men in the Long-
boat was very much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any Means;
but we handed down some Deal Boards into the Boat,
and the Carpenter presently set up a kind of a Fence
like Waste-boards, to cover them from the Arrows of
the Savages, if they mould moot again.
About half an Hour afterwards they came all up in
a Body astern of us, and pretty near, so near that we
could easily discern what they were, though we could
not tell their Design. I easily found they were some
of my old Friends, the fame Sort of Savages that I had
been used to engage with; and in a little time more they
row'd somewhat farther out to Sea, till they came direct-
ly Broadside with us, and then rowed down strait upon
us,
us, till they came so near, that they could hear us
speak: Upon this I ordered all my Men to keep close*
lest they should moot any more Arrows, and make all
our Guns ready % but being so near, as to be within
Hearing, I made Friday go out upon the Deck, and
call out aloud to them in his Language, to know what
they meant; which accordingly he did; whether they
understood him or not, that I knew not: But as sooilr
as he had called to them, six of them, who were in
the foremost or nighest Boat to us, turned their Canoes
from us; and, stooping down, mewed us their naked
Backsides just as if, in Englijb (saving your Presence)
they had bid us kiss-* ;whether this was a Defi-
ance or Challenge, we know not; or whether it was
done in mere Contempt, or a Signal to the rest; but
immediately Friday cry'd out, They were going to
shoot; and unhappily for him (poor Fellow) they let
fly about 300 of their Arrows; and> to my inexpressible
Grief, killed poor Friday, no other Man being in their
Sight. The poor Fellow was Ihot with no less than
three Arrows, and about three more fell very nigh him;
such unlucky Marksmen they were*
I was so enraged with the loss of my old Servant,
the Companion of all roy Sorrows and Solitudes, that
I immediately ordered five Guns to be loaded with
small Shot, and four with great; and gave them such
a Broadside as they had never heard in their Lives be-
fore, to be sure.
They were not above half a Cable's Length off when
we fired; and our Gunners took their Aim so well*
that three or four of their Canoes were overset, as we
had Reason to believe, by one Shot only*
The ill Manners of turning up their bare Backsides
to us, gave us no great Offence; neither did I know
for certain, whether that* which would pass for the
greatest Contempt among us, might be understood so
by them, or not; therefore in Return, I had only re-
solved to have sired four or five Guns with Powder
only; which I knew would fright them sufficiently:
But when they shot at us directly with all the Fury
they were;.capable of, and especially as they had killed
my poof-Friday, whom I so intirely loved and valued,
and who,, indeed, so well deserved it j I noc bnlv ha i been
Vol, II. U 'j.^ei
justified before God and Man, but would have been
very glad, if I could, to have overset every Canoe
there, and drowned every one of them.
I can neither tell how many we killed, or how many
-we wounded, at this Broadside; but sure such a Fright
and Hurry never was seen among such a Multitude;
there were 13 or 14 of their Canoes split, and overset,
in all 5 and the Men all set a swimming; the rest,
frighted out of their Wits, scoured away as fast as they
could ;. taking but little Care to save those whose Boats
were split or spoiled with our Shot: So I suppose, that
they were, many of them, lost: And our Men took up
one poor Fellow swimming for his Life, above an
Hour after they were all gone.
Our small Shot, from our Cannon, must needs kill
and wound a great many: But, in sliort, we never
knew any thing how it went with them; for they Bed
fb fast, that, in three Hours, or thereabouts, we could
not fee above three or four straggling Canoes; nor did
we ever fee the rest any more; for a Breeze of Wind-
springing up the same Evening, we weighed, and set
Sail for the Brafi/s.
We had a. Prisoner indeed; but the Creature was so
sullen-, that he would neither eat or speak; and we all
fansy'd he would starve himself to Death: But I took
a way to cure him; for I made them take him, and
turn him into the Longboat, and make him believe they
would toss him into the Sea again, and so leave him
where they found him, if he would not speak; nor
would that do, but they really did throw him into the
Sea, and came away from him; and then he followed
them; for he swam like a Cork, and called to them in
his Tongue, though they knew not one Word of what
he said. However, at last they took him,in again, and
then he began to be more tractable; nor did I ever
design they mould drown him.
We were now under Sail again; but I was the most
disconsolate Creature alive, for want of my Man Friday,
and would have been very glad to have gone back to
the Island,, to have taken one of the rest from thence
for my Occasion, but it could not be; so we went on:
We had one Prisoner, as I have said; and 'twas a long
while before we could make him understand any thing 4
but, in time, our Men taught him some EngUJk) and he
began to be a little tractable: Afterwards we inquired
what Country he came from, but could make nothing
of what he said; for his Speech was so odd, all Guttu-
rals, and spoken in the Throat, in such an hollow and
odd Manner, that we could never form a Word from
him; and we were all of Opinion, that they might
speak that Language as well, if they were gagged, as
otherwise; nor could we perceive that they had any
Occasion, either for Teeth, Tongue, Lips, or Palate;
but formed their Words, just as shunting Horn forms
a Tune, with an open Throat: He told us, however,
some time after, when he had fcaught him to speak a
little EngHJh, that they were going, with their Kings
to fight a great Battle. When he said Kings, we alke4
him how many Kings? He said, There were five Na»
tion (we could not make him understand the Plural S$
and that they all joined to go against two Nation. We
asked him, What made them come up to us? He said,
To mahe te great Wonder look: Where it is to- be ob-
served, That all those Natives, as also those of Africa,
when they learn English, they always add two E's at the
End of the Words where we use one, and place the
Accent upon the last jof them, as tnaiee, takee, and
die like; and we could not break them of it * nay,
] could hardly make Friday leave it off, tho5 at iast he
did.
And now I name the poor Fellow once more, I
must take my last Leave of him; poor honest Friday f
We buried him with all Decency and Solemnity pofhV
hie, by putting him into a Coffin, and throwing hi$t;
into the Sea $ and I caused them to lire eleven Guns
for him; and so ended the Life of the most grateful,
faithful, honest, and most affectionate Servant that ever
Man had.
We now went away with a fair Wind for Brasi/,
and in about twelve Days time we made Land in the
Latitude of iive Degrees South of the Line, being the
North-eastermost Land of all that Pa-it of America.
We kept on S. by E. in Sight of the Shore four Days*
when we made the Cape St. Augufliw, and in three
Days came to an Anchor off the Bay of All-Saints*
the old Place os my Deliverance, from whence came
both my good and evil Fate.
Never Ship came to this Part, that had less Business
than I had; and yet it was with great Difficulty that
we were admitted to hold the least Correspondence on
Ihore: Not my Partner himself, who was alive, and
made a great Figure among them; not my two Mer-
chant Trustees, nor the Fame of my wonderful Pre-
servation in the Island, could obtain me that Favour:
But my Partner, remembring, that I had given 500
Moidores to the Prior of the Monastery of the dugus-
tinesy and 372 to the Poor, went to the Monastery, and
obliged the Prior that then was, to go to the Gover-
nor, and beg Leave for me presently, with the Captain,
and one more, besides eight Seamen, to come on more,
and no more; and this upon Condition absolutely capi-
tulated for, that we should not offer to land any Goods
out of the Ship, or to carry any Person away without
Licence.
They were so strict with U9, as to landing any Goods,
that it was with extreme Difficulty that I got on ihore
three Bales of EngHJb Goods, such as fine Broadcloths,
Stuffs, and some Linen, which I had brought for a Pre-
sent to my Partner.
He was a very generous broad-hearted Man, though
(like me) he came from little at first; and though he
knew not, that I had the least Design of giving him
any thing, he sent me on board a Present of fresh Pro^
visions, Wine, and Sweetmeats, worth above 30 Moi-
dores, including some Tobacco, and three or four fine
Medals in Gold. But I was even with him in my Pre*
sent, which, as I have said, consisted of sine Broadcloth,
English Stuffs, Lace, and sine Hollands, Also I delivered
him about the Value of 100/, Sterling, in the same
Goods, for other Uses; and I obliged him to set up
the Sloop which I had brought with me from Eng-
land, as I have said, for the Use of my Colony, in or-
der to send the Refreshments I intended to my Plan-
tation.
Accordingly he got Hands, and sinifhed the Sloop in
a very few Days, for she was already framed, and I gave
the Master of her such Instructions as he could not miss
the
the Place; nor did he miss it, as I had an Account
from my Partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded
with the small Cargo I had sent them; and one of
our Seamen, that had been on lhore with me there,
offered to go with the Sloop, and settle there, upon
my Letter to the Governor Spaniard, to allot him a
sufficient Quantity of Land for a Plantation; and giv-
ing him some Cloaths, and Tools for his Planting-
work, which, he said, he understood, having been an
old Planter in Maryland, and a Buccaneer into the Bar-
gain.
I encouraged the Fellow by granting all he desir'd;
and as an Addition, I gave him the Savage which we
had taken Prisoner of War, to be his Slave, and or-
dered the Governor Spaniard to give him his Share of
every thing he wanted with the rest.
When we came to fit this Man cut, my old Partner
told me, there was a certain very honest Fellow, a Brafil
Planter of his Acquaintance, who had fallen into the
Displeasure os the Church; I know not what the Mat-
ter is with him, fays he; but, on my Conscience, I
think he is an Heretic in his Heart; and he has been
obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition;
that he would be very glad of such an Opportunity to
make his Escape, with his Wife, and two Daughters;
and if I would let them go to my Island, and allot
them a Plantation, he would give them a small Stock
to begin with; for the Officers of the Inquisition had
seized all his Effects and Estate, and he had nothing left
but a little Houmold^ stuff, and two Slaves. And, adds
he, though I hate his Principles, yet I would not have
him fall into their Hands; for he will assuredly be burnt
alive, if lie does.
. I granted this presently, and joined my Englijhman
with them; and we concealed the Man, and his Wife
and Daughters, on board our Ship, till the Sloop
put out to go to Sea; and then (having put all their
Goods on fyoard the Sloop some time before) we put
them on board the Sloop, after me was got out of the
Bay.
Our Seaman was mightily pleased with this new
Partner; and their Stock, indeed, was much alike rich
i» Tools, in Preparations, and a Farm; but nothing to
begin
begin with, but as above. However, they carried ove*
with them (which was worth all the rest) some Materials
for planting Sugar-canes, with some Plants of Canes;
which he, I mean the Portugal Man, understood very
well.
Among the rest of the Supplies sent my Tenants in
the I stand, I sent them, by this Sloop, three Milch
Cows, and five Calves, about twenty-two Hogs among
them, three Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and a
Stone-horse.
For my Spaniards,, according to my Promise, I en-
gaged three Portugal Women to go; and recommended
it to them to marry them, and use them kindly. I
could have procured more Women, but I remembered,
that the poor persecuted Man had two Daughters, and
there were put five of the Spaniards that wanted; the
rest had Wives of their own, though in another Coun-
try.
. All this Cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily
suppose, very welcome to my old Inhabitants, who
Were now (with this Addition) between sixty and se-
venty People, besides little Children; of which there
were a great many: I found Letters at London from 'em,
all by Way of Lijbon, when I came back to England;
being sent back to the Brajils by this Sloop; of which
I shall take some Notice in its Place,
I have now done with my Island, and all manner of
IDiseourse about it; and whoever reads the rest of my
Memorandums, would do well to turn his Thoughts
intirely from it, and expect to read only of the Follies
of an old Man, not warned by his own Harms, much
less by those of other Men, to beware of the like; not
cooled by almost forty Years Misery and Disappoint-
ments ; not satisfied with Prosperity beyond Expecta-
tion; not made cautious by Affliction and Distress be-
yond Imitation.
I had no more. Business to go to the East-Indie's than
a Man at full Liberty, and having committed no Crime,
has to go to the Turney at Newgate, and desire him
to lock him up among the Prisoners there, and starve
hjm. Had I-taken a small Vesibl from England, and
went directly to the Island ; had I loaded her, as I did1
the other Vessel, with all the Necessaries for the Planta-
tion*
tion, and for my People, took a Patent from the Govern-
ment here, to have secured my Property, in Subjection
only to that of England, which, to be sure, I might
have obtained; had I carried over Cannon and Ammu-
nition, Servants, and People to plant, and, taking Pos-
session of the Place, fortified and strengthened it in :Ihe
Name of England, and increased it with People* t
might easily have done; had I then settled myself there,
and sent the Ship back, loaden with good Rice, as I
might also have done in six Months time, and ordered
my Friends to have fitted her our again for our Supply;
had I done this, and stayed there myself, I had, at least,*
acted like a Man of common Sense; but I was possess *d
with" a wandering Spirit, scorned all Advantages, pleasM
myself with being the Patron of these People I had
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty
majestic Way, like an old Patriarchal Monarch; pro-
viding for them, as if I had been Father of the whole
Family, as well as of the Plantation: But I never so
much as pretended to plant in the Name of any Govern-
ment or Nation, or to acknowledge any Princee, or to
call my People Subjects to any one Nation more than
another: nay, I never so much as gave the Place a
Name; but left it as I found it, belonging to no Man;
and the People under no Discipline or Government bat
my own; who, though I had an Influence over them
as Father and Benefactor, had no Authority or Power
to act or command one way or other, farther than vo-
luntary Consent moved them to comply; yet even this*
had I stayed there, would have done well enough; but
as I rambled from them, and came thither no more, the
last Letters I had from any of them, were by my Part-
ner's Means; who afterwards sent another Sloop to the
Place; and who sent me Word, though I had not the
Letter till five Years after it was written, that they went
on but poorly, were malecontent with their long Sta^r
there; that WilL Atkins was dead; that five of the
Spaniards were come away; and that though they had
not been much molested by the Savages, yet they had
had some Skirmilhes with them; that they begg'd of
him to write to me, to think of the Promise I had
made to fetch them away, that they might see their own
Country again, before they died.
3 But
But I was gone a <wild Goose Cbace indeed; and they
who will have any more of me, must be content to
follow me through a new Variety of Follies, Hard-
ihips, and wild Adventures; wherein the Justice of
Providence may be duly observed, and we may fee
how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own Desires,
make the strongest of our Wishes to be our Affliction,
and punish us most severely with those very Things
which we think it would be our utmost Happiness to be
allowed in.
Let no wife Man flatter himself with the Strength
of his own Judgment, as if he was able to chuse any
particular Station of Life for himself. Man is a short-
sighted Creature, fees but a very little way before him j
and as his Passions are none of his best Friends, so his
particular Affections are generally his worst Counsel-
lors.
I fay this, with respect to the impetuous Desire I had
from a Youth, to wander into the World j arid how
evident it now was, that this Principle was preserved
in me for my Punishment. How it came on, the Man-
ner, the Circumstance, and the Conclusion of it, it is
easy to give you historically, and with its utmost Va-
riety of Particulars. But the secret Ends of Divine
Providence, in thus permitting us to be hurried down
the Stream of our own Desires, are only to be under-
stood of those who can listen to the Voice of Provi-
dence, and draw religious Consequences from God's
Justice, and their own Mistakes.
Be it, I had Business, or no Business, away I went;
'tis no Time now to enlarge any farther upon the Rea-
son or Absurdity of my own Conduct; but to come
to the History, I was embarked for the Voyage, and
the Voyage I went.
I mould only add here, that my honest and truly
pious Clergyman left me here > a Ship being ready to
go to Lifio7i, he asked me Leave to go thither; being
still, as he observed, bound never to finish any Voyage
he began; how happy had it been for me, if I had
gone with him.
But it was too late now j all Things Heaven appoints-
are best; had I gone with him, I had never had so
caany Tilings to be thankful for, and you had never
heard
heard of the Second Part of the Travels and Adventures
of Robinson Crusoe; so I must leave here the fruitless
exclaiming at myself, and go on with my Voyage.
From the Brash we made directly away over the
Atlantic Sea, to the Cape de homie Esperance, or, as we
call it, the Cape os Good Hope; and had a tolerable good
Voyage, our Course generally South-East; now and
then a Storm, and some contrary Winds. But my Dis-
asters at Sea were at an End ; my future Rubs and cross
Events were to befai me on more; that it might ap-
pear, the Land was as well prepared to be our Scourge,
as the Sea; when Heaven who directs the Circum-
stances of Things, pleases to appoint it to be so.
Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a Supra-
cargo on board, who was to direct all her Motions, af-
ter me arrived at the Cape; only being limited to certain
Number of Days, for Stay, by Charter party, at the
several Ports she was to go to : This was none of my
Business, neither did I meddle with it at all; my Nephew
the Captain, and the Supracargo, adjusting all those
Things between them, as they thought fit.
We made no Stay at the Cape, longer than was need-
ful to take in fresh Water; but made the best of our
Way for the Ccast of Corcmandel; we were indeed in-
formed, that a French Man of War of fifty Guns, and
two large Merchant-ships, were gone for the Indies;
and, as I knew we were at War with France, I had some
Apprehensions of them; but they went their own Way,
and we heard no more of them.
I shall not pester my Account, or the Reader, with
Descriptions of Places, Journals of our Voyages, Varia-
tions of the Compass, Latitudes, Meridian Distances,
Trade-winds, Situation of Ports, and the like; such as
almost all the Histories of long Navigation are full of;
and which make the Reading tiresome enough j and are
perfectly unprofitable to all that read, except only to
those who are to go to those Places themselves.
It is enough to name the Ports and Places which we
touch'd at; and what occurred to us upon our pasting
from one to another. We touched first at the Island
of Madagascar; where, though the People are fierce
and treacherous, and in particular, very well armed
with Lances and Bows, which they use with incon-
Vol, II. X VeivaWe
ceivable Dexterity; yet we fared very well with then*
awhile; they treated us very civily; and, for some
Trifles which we gave them, such as Knives, Scissars,
&c. they brought us eleven good fat Bullocks, mid-
dling in Size, but very good in Flesh; which we took
in, partly for fresli Provisions for our present spending,
and the rest to salt for the Ship's Use.
We were obliged to stay here for some Time, after we
had furnim'd ourselves with Provisions; and I, that
was always too curious to look into every Nook of
the World wherever I came, was for going on shore
as often as I could. It was on the East Side of the
Island that we went on shore one Evening; and the
People, who, by the way, are very numerous, came
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us, at a Di-
stance: As we had traded freely with them, and had
been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no Danger;
but when we saw the People, we cut three Boughs
out of a Tree, and stuck them up at a Distance from
us, which, it seems, is a Mark in the Country, not
only of Truce and Friendship, but, when it is accepted,
the other Side set up three Poles, or Boughs, also;
which is a Signal, that they accept the Truce too; but
then this is a known Condition of the Truce, that you
are not to pass beyond their three Poles towards them,
nor they come past your three Poles or Boughs toward
you; so that you are perfectly secure within the three
Poles, and all the Space between your Poles and theirs,
is allowed like a Market, for free Converse, Traffick,
and Commerce. When you go thither, you must not
carry your Weapons with you; and if they come into
that Space, they stick up their Javelins and Lances, all
at the first Poles, and come on unarm'd; but if any
Violence is offered them, and the Truce thereby broken,
away they run to the Poles, and lay hold of their Wea-
pons; and then the Truce is at an End.
Jt happened, one Evening, when we went on more
that a greater Number of their People came down
than usual; but was all very friendly and civil. They
brought with them several Kinds of Provisions, for
which we satisfied them, with such Toys a.$ we had;
their Women also brought us Milk and Roots, and se-
veral Things very acceptable to u?, and all was quiet $
and we made us a little Tent, or Hut, of some Boughs
of Trees, and lay on shore all that Night.
I know not what was the Occasion, but I was not so
well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the Boat ly-
ing at an Anchor, about a Stone's Call from the Land,
with two Men in her to take care of her, I made one
of them come on more; and, getting some Boughs of
Trees to cover us also in the Boat, I spread the Sail on
the Bottom of the Boat, and lay on board, under the
Cover of the Branches of the Trees, all Night.
About two o'Clock in the Morning we heard one
of our Men make a terrible Noise on the Shore, calling
out, for God's fake, to bring the Boat in, and come:
and help them, for they were ail like to be murder'd;
at the fame Time I heard the firing of five Mufquets,
which was the Number of the Guns they had, and that
three times over; for, it seems, the Natives here were
not so easily frighted with Guns, as the Savages were
in America^ where I had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the Matter; but
rousing immediately from Sleep with the Noise, I
caused the Boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with
three Fusils we had on board, to land, and assist our
Men.
We got the Boat soon to the Shore; but our Men
were in too much Haste: For, being come to the Shore*
they plunged into the Water, to get to the Boat with
all the Expedition they could, being pursued by be-
tween three and four hundred Men, Our Men were
but nine in all, and only five of them had Fusils with
them; the rest, indeed, had Pistols and Swords, but
they were of small Use to them;
We took up seven of our Men, and with Difficult/
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded;
and that which was still worse, was, that while we
stood in the Boat to take our Men in, we were in as much
Danger as they were in on shore; for they pour'd their
Arrows in upon us so thick, that we were fain to
barricade the Side of the Boat up with the Benches,
and two or three loose Boards, which, to our great
Satisfaction, we had, by mere Accident, or Providence
rather, in the Boat,
X 2 Mi
And yet, had it been Day-light, they are, it seems,
such exact Marksmen, that if they could have seen but
the least Part of any of us, they would have been sure
of us; we had, by the Light of the Moon, a little
Sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the Shore
with Darts and Arrows ;• and, having got ready our
Fire-Arms, we gave them a Volley; ami we could hear
by the Cries of some of them, that we had wounded
several; however, they stood thus in Battle-array on the
Shore till Break of Day, which we suppose was, that
they might fee the better to take their Aim at us.
In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how to
weigh our Anchor, or set up our Sail, because we must
needs stand up in the Boat, and they were as sure to hit
us, as we were to hit a Bird in a Tree with small Shot;
we made Signals of Distress to the Ship, which, tho1
she rode a League off, yet my Nephew the Captain,
hearing our Firing, and, by Glasses, perceiving the Pos-
ture we lay in, and that we fired towards the Shore,
pretty well understood us; and, weighing Anchor with
all Speed, he stood as near the Shore as he durst with
the Ship, and then lent another Boat, with ten Hands
In her, to assist us ; but we called to them not to come
too near, telling them what Condition we were in:
However, they stood in nearer to us; and one of the
"Men, taking the End of a Tow-line in his Hand, and
keeping our Boat between him and the Enemy, so that
they could not perfectly see him, swam on board us,
and made the Line fast to the Boat; upon which we
llipt our little Cable, and, leaving our Anchor behind,
they tow'd us out of the Reach of the Arrows, we all
the while lying close behind the Barricado we Kad
made.
As soon as we were got from between the Ship^ and
the Shore, that me could lay her Side to the Shore, we
ran along just by them, and we poured in a Broadside
among them, loaded with Pieces of Iron and Lead, small
Bullets, and such Stuff, besides the great Shot, which
made a terrible Havock among them:
When we were got on board, and out of Danger, we
had Time to examine into the Occasion of this Fray;
and, indeed, our Supracargo, who had been often in
those
those Parts, put me upon it; for he said, he was sure
the Inhabitants would not have touched us, after we had
made a Truce, if we had not done something to pro-
voke them to it: At length it came out, viz. that an
old Woman, who had come to sell us some Milk, had
brought it within our Poles, with a young Woman
with her, who also brought some Roots or Herbs:
and while the old Woman, whether she was Mother to
the young Woman, or no, they could not tell) was sel-
ling us the Milk, one of our Men offered some Rude-
ness to the Wench that was with her; at which the
old Woman made a great Noise. However, the Seaman
would not quit his Prize, but carried her out of the old
Woman's Sight, among the Trees, it being almost dark;
the old Woman went away without her, and, as we
suppose, made an Outcry among the People she came
from , who, upon Notice, raised this great Army upon
us in three or four Hour?; and it wras great Odds but
we had been all destroyed.
One of our Men was killed with a Lance that was
tluown at him, just at the Beginning of the Attack, as
he sally'd out of the Tent we had made; the rest came
off free, all but the Fellow who was the Occasion of all
the Mischief; who paid dear enough for his black Mi-
stress; for we could not hear what became of him a
great while; we lay upon the Shore two Days after,
though the Wind presented, and made Signals for him;
made our Boat fail up-more, and do\vn»fhore, several
Leagues, but in vain; so we were obliged to give him
over; and if he alone had suiFered for it, the Loss had
been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven-
turing on shore once more, to try if I could learn any
thing of him or them; it was the third Night after the
Action, that I had a great Mind to learn, if I could by
any means, what Mischief we had done, and how the
Game stood on the bidiav Side: I was careful to do it
in the Dark, lest we should be attacked again; but I
ought indeed, to have been sure, that the Men I went
with, had been under my Command, before I engaged
in a Thing so hazardous and mischievous, as I was
brought into it without my Knowledge or Desire.
We
We took twenty stout Fellows with us as any in the
Ship, besides the Supracargo and myself; and we landed
two Hours before Midnight, at the fame Place where
the Indians stood drawn up the Evening before; I land-
ed here, because my Design, as I have said, was chiefly
to fee if they had quitted the Field, and if they had left
any Marks behind them, or of the Mischief we had
done them; and I thought, if we could surprise one or
two of them, perhaps we might get our Man again, by
way of Exchange.
We landed without any Noise, and divided our Men
into two Companies, whereof the Boatswain com-
manded one, and I the other: We neither could hear
nor see any body stir, when we landed; so we marched
op, one Body at a Distance from the other, to the
Field of Battle; At first we could see nothing, it being
very dark; but by-and-by, our Boatswain, that led the
first Party, stumbled and fell over a dead Body: This
made them halt them awhile; for, knowing by the Cir-
cumstances, that they were at the Place where the In-
dians had stood, they waited for my coming up: Here
we concluded to halt till the Moon began to rife, which
we knew would be in less than an Hour; and then
we could easily discern the Havock we had made
among them: We told two-and-thirty Bodies upon
the Ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some
had an Arm, and some a Leg, shot off; and one, hi9
Head: Those that were wounded, we supposed they
had carried away.
When we had made, as I thought, a full Discovery
of all we could come at the Knowledge of, I was for
going on board again but the Boatswain and his Party
often sent me Word, that they were resolved to make a
Visit to the Indian Town, where these Dogs, as they
called them, dwelt; and desired me to go along with
them; and if they could find them, as they still fansied
they mould, they did not doubt, they said, getting a
good Booty; and it might be, they might find Thomas
Jeffrys there; that was the Man's Name we had lost.
Had they sent to a(k my Leave to go, I knew well
enough what Answer to have given them; for I would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing it
: was
was not a Hazard fit for us to run, who had a Ship,
and Ship's Loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to
make, which depended very much upon the Lives of
the Men; but as they sent me Word they were re-
solved to go, and only afk'd me and my Company to,
go along with them, I positively refused it, and rose
up (for I was fitting on the Ground) in order to go
to the Boat; one or two of the Men began to impor-
tune me to go; and, when I still refused positively, be-
gan to grumble, and say they were not under my Com-
mand, and they would go: Come, Jacky says one of the
Men, will you go with me? I'll go for one- Jack said
he would; and another followed, and then another;
and, in a word, they all left me but- one, whom, with
much Difficulty too, I persuaded to stay; so the Supra-
cargo and I, with one Man, went back to the Boat,
where, I told them, we would stay for them, and take
care to take in as many of them as should be left; for
I told them, it was a mad Thing they were going about,
and supposed most of them would run the Fate of
Thomas Jeffrys*
They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off again; and they would take care, £5V.
So away they went. I intreated them to consider the
Ship, and the Voyage; that their Lives were not their
own; and that they were intrusted with the Voyage,
in some measure; that if they miscarried, the Ship
might be lost for want of their Help; and that they
could not answer it to God and Man. I said a great
deal more to them on that Head, but I might as well
have talked to the Main-mast of the Ship; they were,
mad upon their Journey; only they gave me good
Words, and begg'd I would not be angry; said, they
would be very cautious, and they did not doubt but
they would be back again in about an Hour at farthest 1
for the Indian Town, they said, was not above half $
Jvlile off: Though they found it above Two Miles bed-
sore they got to it.
Well, they all went away, as above; and though the
Attempt was desperate, and such, as none but Madmen
would have gone about, yet, to give them their Due,
they went about it warily, as well as boldly. They
were gallantly armed, that is true; for they had every
Man a Fusil or Musquet, a Bayonet, and every Man a
Pistol; some of 'em had broad Cutlasses, some of 'cm
Hangers; and the Boatswain, and two more, had Pole-
axes: Besides all which they had among them thir-
teen Hand-Grenadoes. Bolder Fellows, and better
provided, never went about any wicked Work in the
World.
When they went out, their chief Design was Plun-
der; and they were in mighty Hopes of finding Gold
there; but a Circumstance which none of them were
aware of, set them on Fire with Revenge, and made
Devils of them all: When they came to the few In-
dian Houses, which they thought had been the Town,
which were not above half a Mile off, they were un-
der a great Disappointment; for there were not above
twelve or thirteen Houses; and where the Town was,
or how big, they knew not: They consulted therefore
what to do, and were some Time before they could re-
solve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut ail
their Throats; and it was ten to one but some of 'em
might escape, it being in the Night, though the Moon
was up,- and if one escaped, he would run away, and
raise all the Town, so they should have a whole Army
upon them. Again, on the other Hand, if they went
away, and left those untouch'd (for the people were all
asleep) they could not tell which Way to look for the
Town.
However, the last was the best Advice; so they re-
solved to leave those Houses, and look for the Town as
well as they could: They went on a little Way, and
found a Cow tied to a Tree: This they presently con-
cluded would be a good Guide to them; for they said,
the Cow certainly belonged to the Town before them,
or the Town behind them; and if they untied her,
they mould fee which Way me went; if me went back,
they had nothing to say to her; but, if she went for-
ward, they had nothing to do but to follow her; so
they cut the Cord, which was made of twisted Flags,
and the Cow went on before them: In a word, the
Cow led them dir^6t]y to the Town, which, as they
reported, consisted of above 200 Houses, or Huts; and
in some of these, they found several Families living
together,
Here
Here-they found ail silent; as profoundly secure, as
Sleep and a Country that had never seen an Enemy os
that.Kind, eould make them : - Upon this they called ano-
ther Council, to consider what they had to do; and,
in a word, they refoldsd to* divide themselves into three
Bodies, and to set thifi^Mrlouses on Fire in three Parts
cf the Town; and as^the Men came out, to seize 'em
and bind 'em; if any resisted, they need not be asked
what to do then; and so to search the rest of the Houses
for Plunder j but resolved to march silently first thro'
the Town, and see what Dimensions it was of, and
consider if they might venture upon it, or no.
They did and desperately resolved that they would
venture upon them i but - while they wese animating
one another to the Work, three of them, that were a
little before the rest, called out aloud, and told them
they had found 7bo. Jejsrys; -they all ran up to the
-Place, and so it was indeed, for there they found the
poor Fellow hanged up naked by one Arm, and his
Throat cut: There was an Indian House just by the Tree,
%vhere- they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
-Indians, who had been concerned in the Fray with us
before, and two-or three of-them wounded Avith our
Shot; and our Men found*they were awake, md talk-
ing one to another in that House, but knew not their
Number.
The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade so en-
raged them, as before, that they swore to one another
they would be revenged, and that not an Indian who
jcame into their Hands should have Quarter; and to
work they went immediately; and yet not so madly
as by the Rage and Fury they were in, might be ex-
pected. Their first Care was to get something that
v/ould soon take Fire; but aster a 'littleSearch, they
-found that would be to no Purpose, fpr most of the
Houses were low, and rfiatch'd with Flags or Rushes,
of which the Country is full; so they presently made
some Wild si re, -as we call it, by wetting a little Pow-
der in the Palms of their Hands,.; and, in a Quarter of
an Hour, they set the Town on Fire in four or five
Places; and particularly that House where the Indians
were not gone to bed. As soon as the Fire began .to
* blaze, the poor frighted Creatures began to ruib gjsc
•.Vol. II. N°. 20. Y * &
to save their Lives; but met with their Fate in the
Attempt, and especially at the Door, where they drove
them back, the Boatswain himself killing one or two
with his Pole-Ax; the House being large, and many
in it, he did not care to go in, but called for an Hand-
grenado, and threw it among them, which, at first,
frighted them; but when it burst, made such Havock
among them, that they cried out in an hideous man-
ner-
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open
Part of the House, were killed or hurt with the Gre-
nado, except two or three more, who pressed to the
Door, which the Boatswain and two more kept with
the Bayonets in the Muzzles of their Pieces, and dis-
patched all who came that Way. But there was ano-
ther Apartment in the House, where the Prince or
King, or whatsoever he was, and several others, were;
and they kept in, till the House, which was by this
time all of a light Flame, fell in upon them, and they
were smothered, or burnt together.
All this while they fired not a Gun, because they
would not waken the People faster than they could
master them; but the Fire began to waken them fast
enough; and our Fellows were glad to keep a little
together in Bodies; for the Fire grew so raging, all
the Houses being made of light combustible Stuff, that
they could hardly bear the Street between them; and
their Business was to follow the Fire for the surer Exe-
cution: As fast as the Fire either forced the People
out of those Houses which were burning, or frighted
them out of others, our People were ready at their
Doors to knock them on the Head, still calling and hal-
looing to one another to remember Tbo. Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very
uneasy, and especially when I saw the Flames of the
Town, which, it being Night, seemed to be just by
jne.
My Nephew the Captain, who was rousM by his
Men too, seeing such a Fire, was very aneasy, not
knowing what the Matter was, or what Danger I was
in; especially hearing the Guns too; for by this Time
they began to use their Fire-Arms: a thousand Thoughts
opprest his Mind concerning me and the Sufracargo,
3 what
what should become of us: And, at last, though he
could ill spare any more Men, yet, not knowing what
Exigence we might be in, he takes another Boat, and,
with thirteen Men and himself, comes on more to
me.
He was surpriz'd to see me and the Supracargo in
the Boat, with no more than two Men, for one had
been left to keep the Boat; and though he was glad,
that we were well, yet he was in the fame Impatience
with us, to know what was doing; for the Noise
continued, and the Flame increased: I confess, it was
next to an Impossibility for any Men in the World to re-
strain their Curiosity of knowing what had happened,
or their Concern for the Safety of the Men. In a
word, the Captain told me, He would go and help his
Men, let what would come. I argued with him, as I
did before with the Men, the Safety of the Ship, and the
Danger of the Voyage, the Interest of the Owners and
Merchants, &c. and told him, I would go, and the
two Men, and only fee if we could, at a Distance, learn
what was like to be the Event, and come back, and tell
him.
It was all one to talk to my Nephew, as it was to talk
to the rest before; he would go, he said, and he only
wished he had left but ten Men in the Ship j for he
could not think of having his Men lost for want of
Help: He had rather5 he said, lose the Ship, the Voyage,
and his Life, and all j and so away went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now, than
I was to persuade them not to go before; so, in Ihort,
the Captain ordered two Men to row back the Pin-
nace, and fetch twelve Men more from the Ship, leav-
ing the Long-boat at an Anchor; and that when they
came back* six Men should keep the two Boats, and six
more come after us; so that he left only 16 Men in
the Ship; for the whole Ship's Company consisted of
65 Men, whereof two were lost in the first Quarrel,
which brought this Mischief on.
Being now on the March, you may be sure we felt
little of the Ground we trod on; and being guided by,
the Fire, we kept no Path, but went directly to the
Place of the Flame. If the Noise of the Guns were
surprising to us before, the Cries of the poor People
Y 2 were
were now quite of another Nature, and filled us with?
Horror. I must confess, I never was at the sacking of.
a City, or at the taking of a Town* by Storm; I have=-
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda in Ireland;
and killing Man, Woman, and Child j and I had read
of Count Tilly sacking of the City of Magdeburg^
and cutting the.Throats of 22000 of both Sexes ; but I
never had an Idea of the Thing itself, before; nor is it
possible to describe it, or the Horror which was upon,
our Minds at hearing it.
However, we went on, and, at length, came to the?
Town, though there was no entering the Streets of it
for the Fire. The first Object we met with, was the
Ruins of a Hut or House, or rather the Ashes of it,
for-the House was consumed; and just before it, plain
now to -be seen by the Light of the Fire, lay four Men
and three Women killed j and, as we thoughts one or
two more lay in the Heap among the Fire, in- short,
there were such Instances of a Rage altogether barba-
rous, and of a Fury something beyond what was hu-
man, that we thought it impossible our Men could
be guilty of it; or, if they were the Authors of it, we
thought that every one of them ought to be put to
the worst of Deaths: But this was not all ; we saw the
Fire increased forward, and the Cry went on just as
the-Fire went on, so that we: were in. the utmost Con-
fusion. We advanced a little Way farther ; and beheld,
to our Astonishment, three Women naked, crying in a
most dreadful manner, and - flying as if they had, in-
deed, had Wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen
Men, Natives* in the fame- Terror and Consternation,
with three of our Englijh Butchers (for I can tell 'ertk
no better) in the Rear; who, when they, could no>tf
overtake them, sired in among them, and one that was*
killed by their Shot fell down in our Sight; when the.
rest saw us, believing us to be their Enemies, and that
we would murder them, as well as those that pursued
them, they set up a most dreadful Shriek, especially the
Women; and two of them fell down as if already
dead' vviththe,. Fright.
My very Soul shrunk within me, and my Blood ran.
chill in my Veins, when I saw this; and, I believe, had
the three English Sailors, that pursued them, come. on.
I had
R 0 B I N S O N G R U S O E. 175
I1 had made our Men kill them all. However, we took*
some Ways to let the poor flying, Creatures know, that
we would not hurt them; and immediately they came
up to us, and kneeling down, with their Hands lifted.
up, made piteous Lamentation to us to save them>
which we let them know we would do; whereupon*
they kept all together in a Huddle, close behind us,
for Protection. I left my Men drawn-up together, and
charged them to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get
at some of our People, and see what Devil it was pos-
sessed them, and what they intended to do; and, in a
word, to command them off; assuring them, that if
they stayed till Day-light, they would have a hundred
thousand. Men about their Ears: I fay, I Left, them, and
went among those flying People,, taking only two of
our Men with me; and there was, indeed, a piteous
Spectacle among them: Some of them had their Feet'
terribly burnt with trampling and running through the
Fire; others their. Hands burnt; one of the Women had*
fallen down in the Fire, and was almost burnt to Death,
before me could get out again; two or three of the
Men had Cuts in their Backs and Thighs, from our
Men pursuing; and another was lhat through the Body,,
and died while I was there.
I would fain have learned what the Occasion of all.
this was; but I could not understood one Word they
said; though by Signs I perceived, that some of them,
knew not what was the Occasion themsehres. I was
so terrified in my Thoughts at this outrageous Attempt,,
that I could not stay there, but went back to my own
Men; I told them my Resolution, and commanded 'em.
to follow me, when in tlfe very Moment, came four
of our Men, with the Boatswain at their Head, running,
over the Heaps of Bodies they had killed, all covered
with Blood and Dust, as if they wanted, more People
to massacre; when our .Men halloo'd to them as loud
as they could halloo; and, with much ado, one of
them made them hear; so that they knew who we were,,
and came up to us.
As soon as the Boatswain saw us, he set up a Hal-
loo like a Shout or Triumph, for having as he thought,
more Help come; and without bearing to hear me, Cap-
tain, fays he, noble Captain, I am glad you are come
we
we have not half done yet; Villains! Hell-hound Dogs!
Til kill as many of them as poor Tom has Hairs upon his
Head. We have sworn to spare none of them; we'll
root out the very Nation of them from the Earth; and
thus he ran on, out of Breath too with Action; and
would not give us Leave to speak a Word,
At last, raising my Voice, that I might silence him
a little; Barbarous Dog! said I, What are you doing?
I won't have one Creature touchM more, upon Pain of
Death. I charge you, upon your Life, to stop your
Hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead Man this
Minute.
Why, Sir, fays he, do you know what you do, or
what they have done? If you want a Reason for what
we have done, come hither; and with that he mewed
me the poor Fellow hanging upon a Tree, with his
Throat cut.
I confess, I was urged then myself, and at another
Time, should have been forward enough; but I thought
they had carried their Rage too far, and thought of
Jacobs Words to his Sons Simeon and Le<vif Cursed be
their Anger, for it nxas fierce; and their Wrath, fir it
<was cruel. But I had now a new Talk upon my
Hands; for when the Men I carried with me saw the
Sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain
them, as I should have had with the others; nay, my
Nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their
Hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of their
Men being overpowered; for, as to the People, he
thought not one of them ought to live; for they had
all glutted themselves with the 'Murder of the poor
Man, and that they ought to be used like Murderers :.
Upon these Words, away ran eight of my Men
with the Boatswain, and his Crew, to complete
their bloody Work: and I, feeing it quite out of my
Power to restrain them, came away pensive and fad;
for I could not bear the Sight, much less the horrible
Noise and Cries, of the poor Wretches that fell into
their Hands.
I got nobody to come back with me but the Supra-
cargo and two Men; and with these I walked back
to the Boats It was a very great Piece of Folly, in
me, I confess, to venture back, as it were alone; fer,
as
as it began now to be almost Day, and the Alarm had
ran over the Country, there stood about 40 Men arnVd
with Lances and Bows at the little Place where the
12 or 13 Houses stood mentioned before; but by Ac-
cident I miss'd the Place, and came directly to the Sea-
fide; and by that time I got to the Sea-side, it was
broad Day; immediately I took the Pinnace, and went
aboard, and sent her cack to assist the Men in what
might happen.
I observed that about the Time I came to the Boat-
side, the Fire was pretty well out, and the Noise abated;
but in about half an Hour after I got on board, I heard
a Volley of our Mens Fire-Arms, and saw a great Smoke;
this, as I understood afterwards, was our Men falling up-
on the forty Men, who, as I said, stood at the few Houses
on the Way; of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen,
and set all those Houses on sire, but did not meddle with
the Women or Children.
By that time the Men got to the Shore again with the
Pinnace, our Men began to appear; they came dropping
in, some and some; not in two Bodies, and in Form, as
they went out, but all in Heaps, straggling here-and-
there, in such a manner, that a small Force of resolute
Men might have cut them all off.
But the Dread of them was upon the whole Country:
The People were amazed, and surprised, and so frighted,
that, I believe, an hundred of them would have Hed at
the Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in all this terrible
Action was there a Man who made any considerable De-
fence; they were so surprised between the Terror of the
Fire, arid the sudden Attack of our Men in the dark, that
they knew not which Way to turn themselves; for if they
fled one Way, they were met by one Party ; if back again,
by another; so that they were every where knocked
down: Nor did any of our Men receive the least Hurtf
except one who strained his Foot, and another had one
of his Flands very much burnt.
I was very angry with my Nephew the Captain, and,
indeed, with all the Men, in my Mind, but with him in
particular; as well for his acting so out of his Duty, as
Commander of the Sl ip, and having the Charge 0/ the
Voyage upon him, as in ki$, prompting, rather than cool-
ing.
ing, the Rage of his Men, in so bloody and cruel an En-
terprize: My Nephew answered me very respectfully;
but told me, that when he saw the Body of the poor
Seaman, whom they had murdered in such a cruel and
barbarous manner, he was not Master of himself, neither
could he govern his Passion: He owned, he should not
have done so, as he was Commander of the Ship; but,
as he was a Man, and Nature moved him, he could not
bear it. As for the rest of the Men, they were not sub-
ject to me at all; and they knew it well enough; so they
took no notice of my Distike.
The next Day we set sail; so we never heard any
more of it. Our Men differed in the Account of the
Number they killed; some said one thing, some another:
But, according to the best of their Accounts .put .all to-
gether, they killed, or destroyed, about 150 People, Men,
Women, and Children, and left not a House standing in
the Town.
As for the poor Fellow Thomas Jejrys, as he was quite
dead, for his Throat was so cut, that his Head was half
off, it would do him no Service to bring him away;
so they deft him where they found him, only took him
down from the Tree where he was hanged by one
Hand.
However just our Men thought this Action to be, I
was against them in it; and I always, after that Time,
told them, God would blast the Voyage; for I looked
upon the Blood they Ihed that Night, to be Murder
in them: For though it is true, that they killed Thomas
Jeffrys, yet it was as true, that Jeffrys was the Aggres-
sor, had broken the Truce, and had violated or de-
bauched a young Woman of theirs, who came to our
Camp innocently, and on the Faith of their Capitula-
tion.
The Boatswain defended this <£uarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said, It was trae, that we
seemed to break the Truce, but really had not; and that
-the War was begun the Night before, by the Natives
themselves, who had shot at us, and killed one of otæ
Men without any just Provocation; so that, as we

extraordinary manner; that though the poor Man had
taken Liberty with a Wench, he ought not to have
been murdered, and that in a such a villainous manner:
And that they did nothing but what was just, and
that the Laws of God allowed to be done to 'Mur-
derers.
One would think this. should have been enough to
have warned us against going on shore among Heathens
and Barbarians ; but it is impossible to make Mankind
wife, but at their own Experience ; and their Experi-
ence seems to be always of most Use to them, when it is
dearest bought.
We were now bound to the Gulph of Persia, and
from thence to the Coast of Coromandel, only to touch at
Suraite; but the chief of the Supracargo's Design lay at
the Bay of Bengal, where, if he missed of the Business
outward-bound, he was to go up to China, and return
to the Coast as he came home.
The first Disaster that befel us, was in the Gulph of
Persia, where five of our Men, venturing on shore, on
the Arabian Side of the Gulph, were surrounded by
the Arabs, and either all killed, or carried away into
Slavery; the rest of the Boats Crew were not able to
rescue them ; and had but just Time to get off their
Boat: I began to upbraid them with the just Retribu-
tion of Heaven in this Cafe; but the Boatswain very-
warm ly told me, he thought I went farther in my Cen-
sures, than I should (hew any Warrant for in Scripture,
and referred to the xiiith of St. Luke, Verse 4. where
our Saviour intimates, that those Men, on whom the
Tower of Siloam fell, were not Sinners above all the
Galileans; but that which, indeed, put me to Silence in
this Cafe, was, that none of these five Men, who were
now lost, were of the Number of those who went on
shore to the Massacre of Madagascar (so I always called
it, though our Men could not bear the Word Masiacre
with any Patience): And, indeed, this last Circumstance,
as I have said, put me to Silence for the present.
But my frequent Preaching to them on this Subject",
had-worse Consequences than I expected; and the Boat-
swain, who had been the Head of the Attempt, came
up boldly to me one time, and told me, He found that
I continually brought that Affair upon the Stage; that I
Vol, II. Z made
made unjust Reflections upon it, and had used the:
Men very ill on that Account, and himself in particu-
lar; that as I was but a Passenger, and had no Com-
mand in the Ship, or Concern in the Voyage, they
were not obliged to bear it; that they did not know-
but I might have some ill Design in my Head, and,,
j^erhaps, to call them to an Account for it, when they
came to England; and that therefore, unless I would,
resolve to have done with it, and also not to concern
myself further with him, or any of his ASairs, he would
leave the Ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail
with me among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him, That I did confess I had all along opposed
the Massacre of Madagascar, for such I would always,
call it; and that I had on all Occasions spoken my
Mind freely about it; though not more upon him than
any of the rest that as to my having no Command in
the Ship, that was true \ nor did I exercise any Autho-
rity, only took the Liberty of speaking my Mind in
Things which publicly concerned us all; as to what
Concern I had in the Voyage, that was none of his
Business ; I was a considerable Owner of the Ship; and
in that Claim I conceived I had a Right to speak, even
farther than I bad yet done, and would not be account-
able to him,, or anyone else ; and began to be a little,
warm with, him: He made but little Reply to me at
that Time, and I thought that Affair had been over.
We were at this Time in the Road to Bengal; andr
being willing to fee the Place,. I went on shore with
the Supraca7~goi in the Ship's Boat, to divert, myself; and
towards Evening, was preparing to go on board, when
one of the Men came to me, and told me, he would
not have me trouble myself to-come down to the Boat:
for they had Orders not to carry me on board. Any
one may guess what a Surprize I was. in atso insolent
a Message and J asked the Man, Who bad him deliver
that Errand to me? He told me the Cockswain. I said
no more to the Fellow, but bid him let them know he.,
had delivered his Message, and that I had given him no
Answer to it.
I immediately went, and found out the Supmftirgo,:
md told him the Story, adding what I presently fore*
2 saw^
saw; <w'fc. That there would certainly be a Mutiny in
the Ship; and intreated him to go immediately on
board the Ship in an Indian Boat, and acquaint the
Captain of it: But I might have spared this Intelligence,
for, before I had spoken to him on shore, the Matter
was effected on board: The Boatswain, the Gunner,
the Carpenter, and, in a Word, all the inferior Officers,
as soon as I was gone off in the Boat, came up to the
Quarter-deck, and desired to speak with the Captain;
and there the Boatswain, making a long Harangue (for
the Fellow talked very well), and repeating all he had
said to me, told the Captain in a few Words, that as I
was now gone peaceably on more, they were loth to
use any Violence with me; which, if I had not gone
on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige
me to have gone. They therefore thought fit to tell
him, that as they (hipped themselves to serve in the
Ship, under |his Command, they would perform it
faithfully : But if I would not quit the Ship, or the
Captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the
Ship, and fail no farther with him : And at that Word
ALL, he turned his Face about towards the Main-mast,
which was, it seems, the Signal agreed on between
them; at which all the Seamen being got together,
they cried out, One and ALL, One and ALL.
My Nephew the Captain was a Man of Spirit, and
*>f great Presence of Mind; and though he was sur-
prised, you may be sure, at the Thing, yet he told them,
calmly, he would consider of the Matter; but that he
could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about
it: He used some Arguments with them, to shew them
the Unreasonableness and Injustice of the Thing; but h
was all in vain,; they swore, and ftiook Hands rouncf,
before his Face, that they would go all on shore, unless
he would engage to them, not to suffer me to come on
board the Ship.
This was an hard Article upon him, who knew his
Obligation to me, and did not know how I might
take it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them; told
them, That I was a very considerable Owner'of the
Ship, and that in Justice he could not put me out of
my own House; that this was next Door to serving
me, as the famous Pirate Kid had done, who made the
Z z Mutiny
Mutiny in the Ship, set the Captain on shore in an unin-
habited Island, and ran away with the Ship ; that let
them go into what Ship they would, if ever they came
to Englatid again, it would cost them dear; that the
Ship was mine, and that he would not put me out of
it j and that he would rather lose the Ship, and the
Voyage too, than disoblige me so much ; so they might
do as they pleased. However, he would go on shore,
and talk with me on shore; and invited the Boatswain
to go with him, and, perhaps, they might accommo-
date the Matter with me.
But they all rejected the Proposal; and said, They
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither
On board, nor on shore; and if I came on board, they
would go on shore. Well, said the Captain, is you are
all of this Mind, let me go on shore, and talk with
him; so away he came to me with this Account, a little
after the Message had been brought to me from the
Cockswain*
I was very glad to fee my Nephew, I must confess;
for I was not without Apprehensions, that they would
confine him by Violence, set sail, and run away with
the Ship; and then I had been stript naked in a remote
Country, and nothing to help myself: In short, I had
been in a worse Case, than when I was all alone in the
Island.
But they had not come that length, it seems, to my
great Satisfaction; and when my Nephew told me what
they had said to him, and how they had sworn, and
shook Hands, that they would one and all leave the
Ship, if I was suffered to come on board, I told him,
He should not be concerned at it at all, for I would
stay on shore: I only desired he would take care and
send me all my necessary Things on more, and leave me
a sufficient Sum of Money, and I would find my Way to
England as well as I could.
This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew; but
there was no way to help it, but to comply with it.
So in short, he went on board the Ship again, and sa-
tisfied the Men, that his Uncle had yielded to their Im-
portunity, and had sent for his Goods from on board
the Ship. So the Matter was over in a very few
Hours \
Hours; the Men returned to their Doty, and I begun to
consider what Course I should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest Part of the World,
as I think I may call it; for I was near three thousand
Leagues, by Sea, farther off from England, than I was
at my Island; only, it is true, I might travel here by
Land over the Great MoguPs Country to Suratte, might
go from thence to BaJJora by Sea, up the Gulph of
Persia, and from thence might take the Way of the Ca-
ravans, over the Desarts of Arabia to Aleppo and Scan-
daroon ; from thence by Sea again to Italy, and so over
Land into France; and this, put together, might be,
at least, a full Diameter of the Globe; but, if it were
to be measured, I suppose it would appear to be a great
deal more.
I had another Way before me, which was to wait
for some EngUJh Ships, which were coming to Bengals
from Achin, on the Island of Sumatra, and get Passage
on board them for England: But as I came hither with-
out any Concern with the Engli/h East-India Company,
so it would be difficult to go from hence without their
Licence, unless with great Favour of the Captains of
the Ships, or of the Company's Factors; and to both I
was an utter Stranger,
Here I had the particular Pleasure, speaking by Con-
traries, to fee the Ship set sail without me; a Treat-
ment, I think, a Man in my Circumstances scarce ever
met with, except from Pirates running away with a
Ship, and setting those that would not agree with their
Villainy, on shore: Indeed, this was the next Door to it,
]both ways: However, my Nephew left me two Ser-
vants, or rather, one Companion, and one Servant;
the first was Clerk to the Purser, whom he engaged to
go with me; and the other was his own Servant: I
took me also a good Lodging in the House of an Eng-
lijh Woman, where several Merchants lodged, some
French, two Italians, or rather Jems, and one English-
man. Here I was handsomely enough entertained;
and, that I might not be said to run rashly upon any
Thing, I stayed here above nine Months, considering
what Course to take, and how to manage myself: I
had some EngUJh Goods with me, of Value, and a con-
fiderabje Sum of Money, my Nephew surniihing me
with a thousand Pieces of Eight, and a Letter of Cre-
dit for more, if I had Occasion, that I might not be
ilreightened, whatever might happen.
I quickly disposed of my Goods, and to Advantage
too -r and, as I originally intended, I bought here some
very good Diamonds, which, of all other Things, was
the most proper for me, in my Circumstances, because
I might always carry my whole Estate about me.
After a long Stay here, and many Proposals made for
my Return to England, but none falling to my Mind,
the Englijb Merchant, who lodged with me, and with
ivhom I had contracted an intimate Acquaintance, came
to me one Morning; Countryman, fays he, I have a
Project to communicate to you, which, as it suits with
my Thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours
also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it.
Here we are posted, says he, you by Accident, and
I by my own Choice, in a Part of the World very re-
mote from our own Country; but it is in a Country,
where, by us, who understand Trade and Business, a
jgreat deal of Money is to be got: If you will put a
thousand Pounds to my thousand Pounds, we will hire
a Ship here, the first we can get to our Minds; you
shall be Captain, Til be Merchant; and we will go a
trading Voyage to China; for what should we stand
JH11 for? The whole World is in Motion, rolling round
and round; all the Creatures of God, heavenly Bodies,
and earthly, are busy and diligent: Why should we be
idle? There are no Drones, fays he, living in the World
^but Men: Why should we be of that Number?
I liked this Proposal very well, and the more, because
at seemed to be expressed with so much good Will, and
in so friendly a Manner: I will not say but that I might,
by my loose and unhinged Circumstances, be the fitter
to embrace a Proposal for Trade, and, indeed, for any
Thing else; or, otherwise, Trade was none of my Ele-
ment: However, I might, perhaps, fay, with some
Truth, That if Trade was not my Element, Rambling
tvas ; and no Proposal for seeing any Part of the World
which I had never seen before, could possibly come amise
*o me:.
It
It was? however, seme Time before we could get
a Ship to our Mind; and when we got a Vessel, it was
not easy to get Englijb Sailors; that is to fay, so many-
as were necessary to govern the Voyage, and manage
the Sailors which we lhould pick up there: After
some Time we got a Mate, a Boatswain, and a Gunner*
English; a Dutch Carpenter, and three Portuguese Fore*
mast Men; with these, we found, we could do well
enough, having Indian Seamen, such as they are, to
make up.
There are so many Travellers, who have written the
History of their Voyages and Travels this Way, that it
would be but very little Diversion to any body, to give
a long Account of the Places we went to, and the Peo-
ple who inhabit there : Those Things I leave to others,
and refer the Reader to those Journals and Travels of
Englishmen, many of which, I find, are published, and
more promised every Day: 'Tis enough for me to tell
you, That we made the Voyage to Achin, in the Island
of Sumatra, first; and from thence to Siam, where we
exchanged some of our Wares for Opium, and for
some Arrack; the first, a Commodity which bears a
great Price among the Chine/e, and which, at that Time,
was very much wanted there : In a Word,, we went up
to Sujham, made a very great Voyage, were eight Month?
out, and returned to Bengal; and I was very well satis^-
fied with my Adventure. I observe that our People in:
England often admire how the Officers, which the Com-
pany fend into India, and the Merchants which generally
stay there, get such very great Estates as they do, and
sometimes come home worth 60, to 70; and a 100 thou-
iknd* Pounds at a Time.
But it is no Wonder, or, at least, we. lhall fee so much
farther into it, when we consider the innumerable Ports
and Places where they have a free Commerce, that it
will then be no Wonder •, and much less will it be so,
when we consider, that at all those Places ajpd Ports,
where the Englijb Ships come, there is so much, and
such constant Demand for the Growth of all other
Countries, that there is a certain Vent for the Return,
as well as a Market abroad for the Goods carried out
In short, we made a very good Voyage, and I got so
much Money by the first Adventure; and such anlnfightr
into
into the Method of getting more, that, had I been
twenty Years younger,. I should have been tempted to
have stayed here, and sought no farther for making my
Fortune: But what was all this to a Man on the wrong
Side of Threescore; that was rich enough, and came
abroad more in Obedience to a restless Desire of seeing
the World, than a covetous Desire of getting in it?
And, indeed, I think, 'tis with great Justice that I now
call it a restless Desire; for it was so; when I was at
home, I was restless to go abroad ; and now I was abroad,
I was restless to be at home : I fay, What was this Gain
to me? I was rich enough already; nor had I any un-
easy Desires about getting more Money; and therefore,
the Profits of the Voyage to me, were Things of no
great Force to me, for the prompting me forward to
farther Undertakings : Hence I thought, that by this
Voyage I had made^no Progress at all ; because I was
come back, as I might call it, to the Place from whence
J came, as to an Home; whereas, my Eye, which, like
that which Solomon speaks of, ivas never satisfied *witb
feeingy was still more desirous of wandering and seeing.
I was come into a Part of the WorJd which I never
was in before; and that Part in particular which I had
heard much of; and was resolved to fee as much of it
as I could; and then I thought, I might fay, I had seen
all the World that was worth seeing.
But my Fellow-Traveller and I had different Notions;
I do not name this, to insist upon my own, for I ac-
knowledge his w*as the most just, and the most suited to
the End of a Merchant's Life ,* who, when he is abroad
upon Adventures, it is his Wisdom to stick to that, as
the best Thing for him, which he is like to get the most
Money by: My new Friend kept himself to the Na-
ture of the Thing, and would have been content to have
gone like a Carrier's Horse, always to the fame Inn,
backward and forward/ provided he could, as he called
it, find his Account in it: On the other Fland, mine, as
old as I was, was the Notion of a mad rambling Boy,
that never cares to fee a Thing twice over.
But this was not all; I had a kind of Impatience
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled
.Resolution imaginable, which Way to go: In the Inter-
val of these Consultations, my Friend, who was always
upon
upon the Search for Business, proposed another Voyage
to me, <uiz. among the Spice-Islands; and to bring
home a Load of Cloves from the Manillas, or there-
abouts ; Places where, indeed, the Dutch do trade; but
the Islands belong partly to the Spaniards; though we
went not so far, but to some other, where they have
not the whole Power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c.
We were not long in preparing for this Voyage;
the chief Difficulty was, in bringing me to come into
it; however, at last, nothing else offering, and finding
that really stirring about, and Trading, the Prosit be-
ing so great, and, as I may fay, certain, had more
Pleasure in it, and more Satisfaction to the Mind, than
fitting still ; which, to me especially, was the unhap-
piest Part of Life; I resolved on this Voyage too;
which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo,
and several Islands, whose Names I do not remember,
and came home in about five Months: We fold our
Spice, which was chiefly Cloves, and some Nutmegs,
to the Persian Merchants, who carried them away for the
Gulph ; and, making near five of one, >ve really got a
great deal of Money.
My Friend, when we made up this Account, smiled
at me; Well now, said he, with a Sort of an agree-
able Insult upon my indolent Temper, is not this bet-
ter than walking about here, like a Man of nothing to da,
and spending our Time in staring at the Nonsense and
Ignorance of the Pagans? Why truly, sakf I, my Friend,
I think it is; and I begin to be a Convert to the Prin-
ciples of Merchandizing; but I must tell you, said I,
by the way, you do not know what I am a doing;
for if once I conquer my Backwardness, and imbark
heartily, as old as I am, I mall harrafs you up and down
the World till I tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly,
I mall never let you lie still.
But to be short with my Speculations: A little while
after this, there came in a Dutch Ship from Batavia;
lhe was a Coaster, not an European Trader, and of about
two hundred Ton Burden : The Men, as they pretend-
ed, having been so sickly, that the Captain had not Men
enough to go to Sea with, he lay by at Bengal j and,
as if having got Money enough, or being willing, for
other Reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public No-
Vol. II. A a tice.
i%& The i/¥F:£ ^nd A;DVENWk^3 of
tice, th&tfre would sell his Ship : This came'to^y ^arfc
be"fore nfv new Partner heard of it ; and I had a great
Hilnd to4>uy it: So I Went home to him, and told him*
bf'it: He considers awhile; for he was no rash Man
neither; but, musing sometime, he replied, She is a
little too brg; but, however, we will have her. Ac-
cordingly we bought the Ship; and, agreeing with the
Master, 'we paid for her, and took Possession: When
We had done so, we resolved to entertain the Me'n, if
We could, to join 'them with those we had, for the pur-
ging our Business; ;but dn a suidden, they having not
deceived their "Wages, but their Share of the Money,.
iisHve afterwards learrit, not one of them was to be found.
"We inquired much about them, and at length were
tosd, That 'they were all gone together, by Land, to>
tyfpay the <gre4tt City of the Mogul's Residence-, and
•from thence were 'tD travel to'Swatte, and so. by Sea, to*
the Gulph df Ptffta.
Nothing 'had so? :heartHy troubled me a good -while,.
^ that I missed 'the Opportunity of going with them?
sfor such a 'Ramble, I thought, and in such Company
as would both have guarded me, and diverted me,
Hvoulft have suited mightily with my great Design ; and
• "I should both have seen the World, and gone home-
wards too: But I'was much better satisfied a few Days
"Sifter, when I came to know what fort of Fellows they
~ivere; for, in lhort, their History was, that this Mam
they called Captain, was the Gunner only, not the Com-
mander ,• 'that they had been a Trading Voyage, in
Which :they were 'attacked on iliore by some of the
Malacans, *who had killed the Captain, and three of his
Men; and that after the Captain was killed, these Men,
eleven in Number, had resolved to, run. away with the?
Ship, which they^did ; and had brought her in at the.
Bay os Bengal, leaving the Mate and live Men more on
shore; of whom, we shall hear farther.
Well j let them come by the Ship how they would,,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though we
* idid not, I confess, examine into Things so exactly as-
We ought; for we never inquired any thing of the
Seamen, who, if we had examined, would certainly
have faultered in their Accounts, contradicted one an-
other, and, perhaps,' contradicted themselves;, or, one
z baw
iow? or otl^er,, we should have seen season to have sus-
pected tlUm,; but the Man shewed us a Bill of Salp For
the Ship, to one Emamtel Clofterjho<ven, or some sad|
Name (for I suppose it was all a Forgery), and ca&ect
Himself by that Name; and we coul|d not contradict;
him; and, being withal a little top unwary, or, at leasts
haying, no Suspicion of the Thing, we went through wit^'
•our Bargain.
However, we picked tip some Englijb Seamen here
aster this, and;, some "Dutch; ana we how resolved fof^
second Voyage to the South-east, for £loves, £sV. that is
to fay, among the Philippine and Mqlaca Isles; and, iri
Æiort, not to* sill this Part of-any,Story w,ith Trifles, when
"wjiat is ye* to come is so remarkable, I scent, from firn*

<^ss; anp was. now the last Year with my Partner, go-
ing in the. Ship, abovementioned, on a Voyage to Qhina $
tut deigning ftrst to Siam> to buy Rice.
In this. Voyage, feeing, by contrary Win^s., obliged
to beat uj3 arid dpwn a great while iri the Streights of
MaJ/aca^ and. among the Islands, we were no "sooner got
clear of those difficult Seas, but we found our Shir*
had sprang a Leak, and, we were, not able, by "all our
Industry, to find out where it was. This forced us t©
make for some fort; and my Partner, who knew the
Country better than I dies, directed the Captain to put
into, th^ $iver of Cambodia; for I had made the EngUJh
Mat;e, one Mr. Thompson^ Captain, not being Willing to
take the. Charge 9s the^ Ship, upon myself: This Rivei*
lies on the Npjrth,-Side of the great Bay or Gujph, whick
goes up to Siqrn. ''>
'gillie we were here, and going ^often on stpre for
Refreshment, there comes to me one Day zxi/English-
man, anas he was, it seems, a Gunner's Mate on board
an En^li/h East-India Ship, which rode *in the fame Ri-
ver, ud at;, or near the City of Cambodia; what brought
tj^n father we knew not j but he comes up to me, arid,
speaking $nglijh> Sii^ fays he, you are a Stranger $0 me^
and I to you; but I have something to tell you,. tha|
very nearly concerns you^
\ loo^d steady at him a good while, and he thought
at first I had known Kim, but I did not: If it very rjearly
A a 2 '* concerns
concerns me, said I, and not yourself, what moves you
to tell it me? I am moved, fays he, by the imminent
Danger you are in; and, for aught I fee, you have no
Knowlege of it: I know no Danger I am in, said I, but
that my Ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out; but I
propose to lay her aground To-morrow, to see if I can
find it. But, Sir, says he, leaky, or not leaky, find it?
or not find it, you wijl be wiser than to lay your Ship
on shore To-morrow, when you hear what I have tp
say to you: Do you know, Sir, said he, the Town
of Cambodia lies about fifteen Leagues up this River?
and there are two large Englijh Ships about five Leagues
on this Side, and three Dutch. Well, said I, and what
is that to me? Why, Sir, fays he, is it for a Man that
U upon such Adventures as you are, to come into a
Fort, and not examine first what Ships there are there,
and whether he is able to deal with them? I suppose
you do not think you are a Match for them. I was
amused very much at his Discourse, but not amazed
at it; for I could not conceive what he meant; and I
turned short upon him, and said, Sir, I wish you would
explain yourself; I cannot imagine what Reason I have
to be afraid of any of the Company's Ships, or Dutch
Ships; I am no Interloper; What can they have to fay
to me?
He looked like a Man half angry, half pleased;
and, pausing awhile, but smiling, Well, Sir, says he,
if you think yourself secure, you must take your Chance;
I am sorry your Fate should blind you against good
Advice; but assure yourself, if you do not put to
Sea immediately, you will the very next Tide, be
attacked by five Long-boats full of Men; and, per-
haps, if you are taken, you will be hanged for a Pir
rate, and the Particulars be examined into afterwards : I
thought, Sis, added he, I mould have met with a bet-
ter Reception than this, for doing you a Piece of Ser-
vice of such Importance. I can never be ungrateful,
said I, for any Service, or to any Man that offers me
any Kindness; but it is past my Comprehension, said
I, what they should ha\re such a Design upon me for:
However, since you say there is no Time to be lost,
and that there is some villainous Design in hand against
jne, I will go on board this Minute, and put to Sea im-
4 ' y •" mediately.
Mediately, if my Men can stop the Leak, or if we can*'
swim without stopping it: But, Sir, said 1> (hall I go
away ignorant of the Reason of all this? Can you* give
Bie.no farther Light into it?
I can tell you but Part of the Story, Shy fays h« j
but I have a Dutch Seaman here with me, and, i be-
lieve, I could- persuade him to tell you the rest; but
there is scarce Time for it: But the short of the Story
is this, the first Part ofwhich* I suppose, you knows
well enough, viz. that you were with this Ship at Su-
matra; that there your Captain was murdered by the;
Malacansy v/ith three of his Men; and that you, or some
of those that were on board with you, ran: away with
the Ship, and are since turned PI RAT ES. This is: the
Sum of the Story, and you will be all seized as Pirates,
I can assure you, and executed with very little Ceremony;
for you know Merchants Ships shew but little Law to Pi-
rate?, if they get them in their Power.
Now you speak plain English,, said I, and I thank
you; and though I know nothing that we have done,
like what you talk of, but I am sure we came honestly
and fairly by the Ship, yet, seeing such Work is a do-
ing, as you fay, and that; you fdem to mean honestly,
I will be upon my Guard/' Nay, Sir,csays he, do nottaite
of being upon your Guard; the best Defence is to be)
put of the Danger; if you have any Regard to your.
Life, and the Lives of all your Men, put out to Sea
without fail at High-water; and as you have a wholes
Tide before you, you will be gone too far out before
they can come down; for they will come away , at
High-water; and as they have twenty Miles , to come";
you get near two flours of them, by-the Difference
of the Tide, not reckoning the Length of the Way:
Besides; as they are only Boats, ^and not Ships, the/
will not venture to follow you far out to Sea, especially
if it blows.
Well, said I, you have teen very kind in this : What
shall I do for you, • to make {you Amends? Sir, fays he;
you may * not be so willing-to make me Amends, be-
cause yoit may not be convinced of the Truth of it: I

if we do convince you, that we have saved your Life,

will leave the rest to you,

board, and the two Men with me. As soon as I
«ame to tie Ship-side* my Partner, who was on board,
c$me out on the Quarter-deck, and called to me, with,
% great 4e_aJL of Joy, Q ho! O ho! we have stopped the
ieaJk! we have stopped the Leak! Say you so, said I;
titrauk God; but weigh the Anchor then immediately:
Weigh! says he: What do you mean by that? What
the Matter? fays he- Ask no Questions^ said I, but
^11 Hands to worjs, and weigh,, without, losing a Mi-
nute*: He was surprised: But, however, he called, the
Captain, and he immediately ordered the Anchor to
fee got up; and though the Tide was not quite done,
yet a little Land-breeze blowing, we stood out to Sea *
ifhen I called him into the Cabin, and told him the
Story at large; and we called in the Men, and they
told us the rest of it; but as it took us up a great deal
as Time, fo before we had done, a Seaman comes to
^be Cajbin-door, and calls out to us, that the Captain,
bade him tell us, we were chafed,: Chafed, said I, by
wham, and by what? By five Sloops, or Boats, said
the Fellow, full of Men, Very well,, said I ; then it i$
apparent there is something in it. In, th,e next place,
I ordered all our Men to be called up,; and tojd them,
That there was a Design to seize the Ship, and to take
us for Pirates; and a&ed them, If they would stand
by us, and by one another ? The Menanswered, chear-
fully, that, one and all, they would live and die with us.
Then I asked the Captain, What way lie thought best
for us to manage a Fight with them: For, resist them
I resolved we would, and that to the last Drop. He
|aid, readily, That the way was-to keep them off with
©ur great Shot, as long as we could, and then tp sire
at them with o\*r small Arms, to keep them from
hoarding us; but when, neither of these would dc« any
longer, we mould retire to our close Quarters» perhaps
they
&ey%ad not Materials to break open our Bttlk-headf>
or get in upon us.
The Gunner had in the mean time, Order, to bring
two Guns to bear fore and aft, out of the Steerage, to
clear the Deck, and load them with Musquet-bullets, ~
and small Pieces of old Iron, and what next came to
hand ; and thus we made ready for Fight ; but all this
while kept out to Sea, with Wind enough, and could
fee the Boats at a Distance, being five large Long-boat*
following us, with all the Sail they could make.
Two of these Boats, which, by our Glasies, we
could fee, were Englijk, had outsailed the rest, were
near two Leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us
considerably ; so that we sound they would come up
with us ; upon which we fired a Gun without a Shot,
to intimate that they should bring to; and we put out
a Flag of Truce, as a signal for Parley; but they kept
crouding after us, till they came within Shot : -Upon*
this we took in our white Flag, they having made nb
Answer to it, hung out the red Flag, and fired at them
with Shot: Notwithstanding this, they came on till
they were near enough to call to them wkh a speaking
Trumpet, which we had on board; so we called to
them, and bade them keep off at their Peril.
It was all one, they crouded after us, and endea-
voured to come under our Stern, so to board us oft
•^ur Quarter : Upon which, seeing they were resolute
Tor Mischief, and depended upon the Strength that fol-
lowed them, I ordered to bring the Ship to, so that
•they lay upon our Broadside, when immediately *we
-fired five Guns at them; one of which, had been'levelled
so true as to carry away the Stern of the hind'ermolV
Boat, and bring them to the Necessity of taking down
their Sail, and running all to the Head of the Boat to
keep her from finking; so she lay by, and had enou^h
of it but, seeing the foremost Boat croud still on aftdr
us, we made ready to sire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three Boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made
up to the Boat which we had disabled, to relieve her,aiiA
we could afterwards fee her take out theWen We Called
again to the foremost Boat, and offered aTruce 'to par-
ley again, and to know what was her Buiin^si'wWi 'as;
i92r Tht ^ t fe and Ap y e n t a r e s ^
butJhad' no Answer; only she crouded close under our
Stern. Upon this Our Gunner, who was a very dex-
trous Fellow, run out his two Chace Guns, and sired
at her; but the Shot missing, the Men in the Boat
shouted, waved their Caps, and came on; but the
Gunner, getting: quickly ready again, fired among
them the second time; one Shot of which, though it
misted the Boat itself, yet fell in among the Men, and
we could easily see, had done a great deal of Mischief
among them; but we, taking no notice of that, weafd
the Ship again, and brought our Quarter to bear upon
them; and, firing three Guns more, we found the Boat
was split almost to Pieces in particular, her Rudder,
and a Piece of her Stern, was shot quite away; so they
handed their Sail immediately, and were in great Dis-
order; but, to complete their Misfortune, our Gunner
let fly two Guns at them again; where he hit them we
could not tell; but we found the Boat was finking, and
some of the Men already in the Water: Upon this I
immediately manned out our Pinnace, which we had
kept close by our Side, with Orders to pick up some
of the Men, if they could, and save them from drown-
ing, and immediately to come on board with them;
because we saw the rest of the Boats began to
come up. Our Men, in the Pinnace, followed their
Orders, and took up three Men; one of which was
just drowning, and it was a good while before we could
recover him. As soon as they were on board, we
croiyied all the Sail we could make, and stood farther
out to Sea ; and we found, that when the other three
Boats came up to the first two, they gave over their
Chace.
Being thus delivered from a Danger, which, though
I knew not the Reason of it, yet ieemed to be much
-greater than I apprehended; I took care, that we would
change our Course, and not let any one imagine whi-
ther we were going; so we stood out to Sea Eastward,
quite out of the Course of all European Ships, whether
they were bound to China, or any-where else, within the
.Commerce of the European Nations.
When we- were now at Sea, we began to consult
j^kh ;the two Seamen, and inquire first, What the
fcÆeanjmg of all this mould be, The Dutchman let us
! •> into
into tfie Secret of it at once; telling us, That the Fel-
low that fold us the Ship, as we said, was no more than
a Thief, that had run away with her. Then he told
us how the Captain, whose Name too he mentioned,
tho' I do not remember it now, was treacherously mur-
der'd by the Natives on the Coast of Malaca, with
three of his Men; and that he, this Dutchman, and four
more, got into the Woods, where they wandered about
a great while; till at length, he in particular, in a mi-
raculous Manner, made his Escape, and swam off to a
Dutch Ship, which failing near the Shore, in its Way
from China > had sent their Boat on shore for fresh
Water; that he durst not come to that Part of the
Shore where the Boat was, but made shift in the Night,
to take into the Water farther off, and, swimming a
great while, at last the Ship's Boat took him up.
He then told us, That he went to Batavia, where
two of the Seamen, belonging to the Ship, had arrived,
having deserted the rest in their Travels; and gave an.
Account, That the Fellow who had run away with
the Ship, fold her at Bengal to a Set of Pirates, which
were gone a cruising in her; and that they had already-
taken an Ettglijb Ship, and two Dutch Ships, very richly-
laden.
This latter Part we found to concern us directly,
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my Partner
said very well, if we had fallen into their Hands, and
they had had such a Preposseffion against us before-
hand,- it had been in vain for us to have defended our-
selves, or to hope for any good Quarters at their Hands;
especially considering that our Accusers had been ous
Judges, and that we could have expected nothing from
them but what Rage would have dictated, and ungo-
verned Passion have executed. And therefore it was
his Opinion, we should go directly back to Bengal, from
whence we came, without putting in at any Port what-
ever; because there we could give an Account of our-
selves, and could prove where we were when the Ship
put in, whom we bought her of, and the like; and,
which was more than all the rest, if we were put to the
Necessity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we
should be sure to have some Justice $ and not be hang'd
first, and judged afterward.
Vol. II. N°. 21. B h X was
I was sometime os my Partner's Opinion; but after
a Iktle more serious thinking, I told him, I thought it
was a very great Hazard for us to attempt returning to
Bengal, for that we were on the wrong Side of the
Streights of Malaca; and that if the Alarm was given,
we should be sure to be way-laid on every Side, as well
by the Dutch of Bata<via, as the Englijb elsewhere; that
if we mould be taken, as it were, running away, we
mould even condemn ourselves, and there would want
no more Evidence to destroy us. I also asked the Englijb
Sailor's Opinion, who said, He was of my Mind, and
that we stiould certainly be taken.
This Banger a little startled my Partner, and all the
Ship's Company; and* we immediately resolved to go
away to the Coast of Tonquin, and so on to China i and
from thence pursuing the first Design, as to Trade, find
some. way or other .to dispose of the Ship, and come
back in some of the Vessels of the Country, such as we
could get. This was • approved of as the best Method
for our Security; and accordingly we steered away
N. N. E. keeping above fifty Leagues off from the'usual
Course to the Eastward.
This, however, put .us to some Inconveniencies; for
first, the Winds, when we came to that Distance from
the Shore, seemed to be more steadily against us, blow-
ing almost Trade, as we call it, from the East, and
E. N. E. so that we were a long while upon our Voyage;
and we were but ill provided with Victuals for so long a
Run; and, which was still worse, there was some Dan-
ger, that those Engstjb and Dutch Ships, whose Boats
pursued.us, whereof some were bound that Way, might
be got in before usand if not, some other Ship, bound
to) China, might have Information of us. from them, and
pursue us with the some Vigour.
I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late Escape from the Longboats,,
to have been in the most dangerous Condition that ever
I" was in through.all my past Life; for, whatever ill Cir-
cumstances I had been in, I .was never pursued for a.
Thief before; nor had 1 ever done any Thing that
merited the Name of distionest, or fraudulent, much
Us, thievish. I had chiefly been mine own Enemy;
or, ai I iay righ'ly say, i had been nobody's Enemy-
but my own. Bat now I was embarafs'd in the wor^
Condition imaginable; for though I was perfectly in-
nocent, I was no Condition to make that Innocence ap-
pear. And if I had been taken, it had been under a
supposed Guilt of the worst Kind; at least, a Crime
esteemed so among the People I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an Escape, tho'
which Way to do it, I knew not; or what Port or Place
we should go to. My Partner, seeing me thus dejected, ~
though he was the most concerned at first, began to en-
courage me; and describing to me the several Ports of
that Coast, told me, Fie would put in,- on the Coast of
Cochinchina, or the Bay of Tonquin; intending to go af-
terwards to Macao, a Town once in the Po/Teilion of the
Portuguese, and where still a great many European Fa-
milies resided, and particularly the Missionary Priests
usually went. thither, in order to their going forward
to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly,
though after a tedious and-irregular Course, and very
much streightened for Provisions, we came within Sight
of the Coast very early" in the Morning; and, upon Re-
flection upon the past Circumstances we were in, and the
Danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved to put into
a small River, which, however, had Depth enough of
Water for us, and to fee if we could, either over Land,
or by the Ship's Pinnace, come to know what Ships were
in any Port thereabouts. This happy Step was, indeed^
our Deliverance; for though we did not immediately fee
any European Ships in the Bay osTcnquin, yet, the next
Morning, there came into the Bay two Dutch Ships, and
a third without any Colours spread out, but which we
believed to be a Dutchman, passM by at abou-t two
Leagues Distance, steering for the Coast of China; and
in the Afternoon went by two Englijh Ships, steering the
fame Course.; and thus, we thought, we saw ourielves
beset with Enemies, both one Way and the other. The
Place we were in was wild and barbarous, the People
Thieves, even by Occupation or Profession; and though,
it is true, we had not much to seek of them, and, ex-
cept getting a few Provisions, cared not how little we
'had to do with them, yet it was with much Difficulty
£ b i that
that we kept ourselves from, being insulted by then*
several ways.
We were in a small River os this Country, within a
few Leagues of its utmost Limits Northward; and by
om Boat we coasted North-east to the Point of Land
which opens the great Bay of Tonquin; and it was in
this beating-up along the Shore, that we discovered as
above, that, in a Word, we were surrounded with Ene-
mies. The People we were among were the most: bar-
barous of all the Inhabitants of the Coast; having no
Correspondence with any other Nation, and dealing
only in Fiih, and Oil, and such gross Commodities; and
it may be particularly seen, that they are, as I said, the
most barbarous of any of the Inhabitants; viz. that
among other Customs they have this as one, That if any
Vessel have the Misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their
Coast, they presently make the Men all Prisoners; that
is to fay, Slaves: And it was not long before we found
a Spice of their Kindness this way, on the Occasion
following.
I have observed above, that our Ship sprung a Leak
at Sea, and that we could not find it out; and however
it happened, that, as I have said, it was stopped unex-
pectedly, in the happy Minute of our being to be seized,
by the Dutch and Engli/h Ships, near the Bay of Si am;
yet, as we did not find the Ship so perfectly tight and
found as we desired, we resolved, while we were in this
Place, to lay her on shore, take out what heavy Things
we had on board, which were not many, and to waih
and clean her Bottom; and, if possible, to find, out
where the Leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the Ship, and brought
all our Guns, and other moveable Things, to one Side,
we try'd to bring her down, that we might come at her
Bottom 5 for, on second Thoughts, we did not care to
lay her dry aground, neither could we find out a proper
Place for it.
The Inhabitants who had never been acquainted with
such a Sight, came wondering down to the Shore, to
look at us; and seeing the Ship lie down on one Side
in such a manner, and heeling towards the Shore, and
not feeing our Men, who were at work on her Botr
*om, with Stages, and with their Boats on the Off*
fide, they presently concluded, that the Ship was cast
away, and lay so very fall on the Ground.
On this Supposition they came all about us in two
or three Hours time, with ten or twelve large Boats,
having some os them eight, some ten Men in a Boat,
intending, no doubt, to have come on board, and plun-
dered the Ship, and if they had found as there, to have
carried as away for Slaves to their King, or whatever
they call him, for we knew nothing who was their Go-
vernor.
When they came up the Ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at work, cn the
Outside of the Ship's Bottom and Side, washing, and
graving, and Hopping, as every Seafaring Man knows
how.
They stood for awhile gazing at us, and we, who
were a little furpriz\i, could not imagine what their
Design was; but, being willing to be sure, we took
this Opportunity to get some of us into the Ship, and
others to hand down Arms and Ammunition to those
that were at work, to defend themselves with, if there
should be Occasion; and it was no more than need;,
for, in less than a Quarter of an Hour's Consultation,
they agreed, it scorns, that the Ship was really a Wreck j
that we were all at Work, endeavouring to save her, or
to save our Lives by the Help of our,Boats; and wheii
We handed our Arms into the Boats, they concluded,
by that Motion, that we were endeavouring to save
some of our Goods: Upon this they took it lor granted
they all belonged to them; and away they came di-
rectly upon our Men, as if it had been in a, Line of
Battle.
Our Men, seeing so many os them, began to be
frighted; for we lay but in an ill Posture to fight, and
cry'd out to u^ to know what they should do. I im-
mediately called to the Men who worked upon the
Stages, to slip them down, and get up the Side into
the Ship: and bade those in the Boat to row round, and
come on board; and those few of us who were on
board, work'd 'with all 'the Strength and Hands we
had, to bring the Ship to rights 5 but however, neither
she Men upon the Stage, nor those in the Boats, coul4
da
tla as they were ordered, before the Cochinchineses were
upon them; and, with two of their Boats boarded our
Longboat, and began to lay hold of the Men as their
'Prisoners. .
The first Mast thry laid hold of was an Englijh Sea-
rnan, a stout strong Fellow, who, having a Mufquet in
his Hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it down in
*he Boat, like a Fool, as I thought. But he understood
3iis Business better than I could teach him; for he grap-
pled the Pcgatiy and dragg^l him by main Force out of
their own Boat into ours; where, taking him by the
two Ears, he beat his Head so against the Boat's Gun-
nel, that the Fellow died instantly in his Hands; and in
the mean time, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up
the Mufquet, and;-with the But-end of it, so laid about
him, that he knocked down five of them, who attempted
to enter the Boat; but this was little towards resisting
thirty or forty Men, who fearless, because ignorant of
their Danger, began to throw themselves into the Long-
boat, where we had but live Men to defend it: But one
Accident gave our Men a complete Victory, which de-
served our Laughter rather than any thing else; and
that was this:
Cur Carpenter being preparing to grave the Outside
of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams where he had
caulked her, to stop the Leaks, had got two Kettles just
let down into the Boat; one silled with boiling Pitch,
and the other with Rosin, Tallow, and Oil, and such
•Stuff* as the Shipwrights use for that Work; and the
Man that tended the Carpenter, had a great iron La-
dle in his Hand, with which he supplied the Men that
were at Work with that hot Stuff; two of the Enemy's
Men entered the Boat jud where this Fellow stood,
being in the Foreflicets; he immediately saluted them
with a Ladleful of the Stuff, boiling hot, which so
burnt and scalded them, being half-naked, that they
roared out like two Bi^h, and, enraged with the Fire,
leaped both into the Sea. The Carpenter law it, and
ersd out, Well done, Jack, give them some more of
it; when stepping forward himself, he takes one of
their Mop, and dipping it in the Pitch-pot, he and his
Man threw it among them so plentifully, that, in short,
os all the Men in tinee-Boats, there was not one that
5 was
was not scalded and burnt with it" in a most frightful
pitiful Manner, and made such a Howling and Crying,
that I never heard a worse Noise, and, indeed, nothing
like it; for it is worth observing, That though Pain na-
turally makes all People cry out, yet. every Nation have
a particular way of Exclamation, and make Noises as
different from another as their Speech. I cannot give
the Noise these Creatures made, a better Name than
Howling, nor a Name more proper to the Tone of it;
for I never heard any thing more like the Noise of the
Wolves, which, as I have (aid, I heard howl in the
Forest on the Frontiers of Languedoc.
I was never pleased with a Victory better in my Life;
not only as it was a perfect Surprize to me, and that
our Danger was imminent before; but as we got this
Victory without any Bloodshed, except of that Man the
Fellow killed with his naked Hands, and which I was
very much concerned at; for I was iick of killing such
poor Savage Wretches, even though it was in my own
Defence, knowing they came on Errands which they
thought jail, and knew no better; aud that though it
may be a just Thing, because necessary, for there is no
necessary Wickedness in Nature; yet I thought it 'was a
fad Life, when we must be always obliged to be killing
oar Fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves; and, indeed,
I think so still; and I would, even now, suffer a great
deal, rather than I would take away the Life even of the
worst Person injuring me. I believe also, all considering.
People, who know the Value of Life, would be of my
Opinion, is they entered seriously into the Considera-
tion of it.
JBut to return to my Story: All the while this was .
doing, my Partner and I, who managed the rest of the
Men on board, had, with great Dexterity, brought the
Ship almost to rights; and, having gotten the Guns
into their Places again, the Gunner called to me, to bid.
our Boat get out of the Way, for he would let sty a-
mong them. I called back again to him, and bid him
not offer to fire, for the Carpenter would do the Work,
without him j but bade him heat another Pitch-kettle
which our Cook, who was on board, took care of, .
Biit the Enemy was so terrified with what they met with,
in their first Attack, that they would not come on again;
and:
and some of them, that were farthest off, seeing the Ship
swim, as it were, upright, began, as we supposed, tc*
see their Mistake, and gave over the Enterprise, finding
it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of this
merry Fight; and, having gotten some Rice, and some
Roots, and Bread, with about sixteen good big Hogs on
board, two Days before, we resolved to stay here no
longer, but go forward, whatever came of it; for we
made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next
Day with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch-
kettle would dispose of for us.
We, therefore, got all our Things on board the fame
Evening, and the next Morning were ready to fail. lit
the mean time, lying at an Anchor some Distance from
the Shore, we were not so much concerned, being
now in a sighting Posture, as well as in a sailing Posture^
if any Enemy had presented. The next Day, having
finished our Work within board, and finding our Ship
was perfectly healed of all her Leaks, we set Sail;
we Would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin; for we
wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known
concerning the Dutch Ships that had been there; but we
durst not stand in there, because we had seen several
Ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before; so we
kept on N. E. towards the Iste of Formosa, as much a-*
fraid of being seen by a Dutch or Englijh Merchant Ship,
as a Dutch or EngUJb Merchant Ship in the Mediterranean
is of an Algerine Man of War.
When we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. EL
as if we would go to the Manillas > or the Philippine
Islands; and this we did, that we might not fall into
the Way of any of the European Ships; and then we
steered North again, till we came to the Latitude of
22 Degrees, 20 Minutes; by which means we made
the Island of Formosa directly, where we came to an
Anchor, in order to get Water, and fresh Provisions,
which the People there, who are very courteous and
civil in their Manners, supplied us with willingly, and
dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their
Agreements and Bargains; which is what we did not
find among other People; and may be owing to the
Remains of Christianity, which was once planted here
by
hf a bufch Missionary of* Protofiants, and is a Testimony
of what I have often observed; w«. That the Christian.
Religion always civilizes the People, and reforms their
Manners, where it is received, whether it works saving
Effects upon them of no.
From hence we failed still North, keeping the Coail
of Cbitia at an equal distance, till we knew we were
beybhd all the Ports Of Chihd, where our European Ships
usually tome; being resolved, if possible, not to fail into
any of their Hands, especially in this Country, where,
as our Circumstances were, we could hot. fail of being
intirely ruined; nay, so great was my Fear in parti-
cular, as to my being taken by them, that I believe
firmly, I would much rather have chosen to fall into
the Hands of the Spanijh Inquisition.
Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, we
resolved to pat into the first Trading Port we should
tome at; and, standing in for the Shore, a Boat came
off two Leagues to us, with an old Portuguese Pilot ori
board, who, knowing us to be an European Ship, came
to offer his Service, which, indeed, we were very glacf
of, and took him on board: Upon which, without ask-
ing us, whither we would go, he dismissed the Boat he
came in, and sent it back.
I thought it was now so much in our Choice, to make
the old Man carry us whither we would, that I began
so talk with him about carrying of us to the Gulph of
Nanquin, which is the most Northern Part of the Coast
of China, The old Man said he knew the Gulph of
Nanquin Very well; but, smiling, aiked us what we
would to there.
I told him we would fell our Cargo, and purchase
China Wares, Callicoe^, Raw Silks, Tea, Wrought Silks*
&c. arid so would return by the fame Course we came.
He told us1 our best Port had been to frave put in' at Ma-
tao, where we could riot fail of a Market for our Opium,
to our Satisfaction, and might, for our IVIoney, have
purchased all Softs of China Goods, as cheap as we
could at Narifuin.
Not 'being able to put the old Man out of his Talk,
of which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told
him, we were Gentlemen, as well as- Merchants; anrf
Yql. XT. C cs that
that we had a Mind to go and see the great City of
Peking, and the famous Court of the Monarch of China.
Why then, fays the old Man, you should go to Ningpo,
where, by the River which runs into the Sea there, you
may go up within five Leagues of the Great CanaL This
Canal is a navigable made Stream, which goes through
the Heart of all that vast Empire of China, crosses all the
Rivers, passes some considerable Hills, by the Help of
Sluices and Gates, and goes up to the City of Peking^
being in Length near 270 Leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our
Business now: The great Question is, If you can carry
us up to the City of Nanquin, from whence we can travel
to Peking afterwards? Yes, he said, he could do so very
well, and there was a great Dutch Ship gone up that
Way just before. This gave me a little Shock; a Dutch
Ship was now our Terror; and we had much rather
have met the Devil, at least, if he had not come in too
frightful a Figure: We depended upon it, that a Dutch
Ship would be our Destruction, for we were in no
Condition to fight them; all the Ships they trade with
in those Parts being of great Burden, and of much greater
Force than we were.
The old Man found me a little confused, and under
some Concern, when he named a Dutch Ship; and said
to me, Sir, you need be under no Apprehension of the
Dutch, I suppose they are not now at War with your
Nation. No, said I, that's true; but I know not what
Liberties Men may take, when they are out of the
Reach of the Laws of their own Country. Why, said
he, you are no Pirates, what need you fear? They will
not meddle with peaceable Merchants fare
If I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly up
into my Face at that Word, it was hinder'd by some
Stop in the Vessels appointed by Nature to circulate
it; for it put me into the greatest Disorder and Confu-
sion imaginable; nor was it possible for me to conceal
it so, but that the old Man easily perceived it.
Sir, said he, I find you are in some Disorder in your
Thoughts, at my Task; pray be pleased to go which
Way you think fit; and, depend upon it, I'll do you all
the Service I can. Why, Seignior, said I, it, is true, I
am a little unsettled in my Resolution at this Time,
whither
whither to go in particular; and I am something more
so, for what you said about Pirates; I hope there are
no Pirates in these Seas; we are but in an ill Condition
to meet with them; for you fee we have but a small
Force, and but very weakly mann'd. ,
O, Sir, said he, do not be concerned, I do not know,
that there h^ve been any Pirates in these Seas these fif-
teen Years, except one, which was seen, as I hear, in
the Bay of Siam, about a Month since; but you may
be assured j(he is gone to the Southward; nor was she
a Ship of any great Force, or fit for the Work; she was
not built for a Privateer, but was run away with by a
reprobate Crew that were on board, after the Captain
and some of his Men had been murdered by the Mala-
canst at or near the Island of Sumatra.
What \ said I, seeming to know nothing of the Mat-
ter, Did they murder the Captain? No, said he, I do
not understand, that they murdered him; but, as they
afterwards ran away with the Ship, it is generally be-
lieved they betrayed him into the Hands of the^ Mala-
cans% who did murder him; and, perhaps, they pro-
cured them to do it. Why then, said I, they deserve
Death, as much as if they had done it themselves.
Nay, said "the old Man, they do deserve it; and they
will certainly have it, if they light upon any EngUJh
or Dutch Ship; for they have all agreed together, that,
if they meet that Rogue, they will give him no Quar-
ter.
But, said I to him, you say the Pirate is gone out
of these Seas: How can they meet with him then?
Why, that is true, said he, they do fay so; but he was,
as I tell you, in the Bay of Siam, in the River Cambo-
dia, and was discovered there by some Dutchmen who
belonged to the Ship, and who were left on shore
when they run away with her; and some English and
Dutch Traders being in the River, they were within a
little of taking him. Nay, said he, if the foremost
Boats had been well seconded by the rest, they had
certainly taken him; but he, finding only two Boats
within Reach of him, tack'd about, and fi¥d at these
two, and disabled them, before the other came up*
and then standing off to Sea, the other were not able
* to follow him, and so he got away. But they have
Ccz . all
all (q e#act a Description of the Ship, that they will be
sure tp know him; and, where-ever they find him*
tfyey have vowed to give no Quarter to either th#
Captain, or the Seamen, but to liang them all up at
the Yard-arm.
What I said I, will they execute them right or wrong,
hang them first, and judge them afterwards? O, Sir I
said the old Pilot, there is no need to make a formal
Business of it with such Rogues as those; let them tie
them Back to Back, and set them a diving; it is no
more than they rightly deserve.
I knew I had my old Man fast aboard, and that he
could do me no Harm; so that I turned short upon
him; Well, nov/> Seignior, said I, and this is the very
Reason why I would have you carry us to Nanquin,
and not to put back to Macao, or to any other Part of
the Country, where the English or Dutch Ships come $
for, be it known to you, Seignior, those Captains of
the English and Dutch Ships are a Parcel of rash, proud,
insolent Fellows, that neither know what belongs to
Justice, or how to behave themselves, as the Laws of
God and Nature direct:; but, being proud of their Of«
fices, and npt, understanding their Power, they would
a4 the Murderers to punish Robbers; would take upon
them to insult Men, sajsly accused, and determine them
guijity. without due Inquiry; and, perhaps, I may live
to^call some of them to an Account for it, where they
may be taught how Justice is to be executed; and that
no Man ought to be treated as a Criminal, till some
Evidence may be;had of the Crime, and that he is the
Man.'
'With this It tpl<J him, that this was the very Ship
the.y had attacked; and gave him a full Account of the
Skirmish, we had with, their Boats, and how foolishly
ana coward-like they behaved1. I told him ail the
Story of pur buying, the. Ship, and how the Dutchmen
served us. I told him, the Reasons I had to believe,
that this Story o^f killing the Master, by the Ma/acam,
was not true.; as also,the running away wi^h the Ship;
buj; that it was all a Fictiqn. of their own, to. suggest
that ]the Men were turned Pirates; and they ought to
haye^been sure it was so, before they had ventured to.

fog, that they woiaid have the Blood of those Mesty wli#

rshe old Man was amazed at this Relation.; and tokfc
13$, We were .very much ia the Right to g& away to the
No-Kh; and that if he mij^ht advise us, it fhodld be to-
fell the Ship in China, v/hich we might very well ck>, and
buy o«.bqjldaaaa:her in the Country: And,-{aid hey tteo*
you will not get so good a Ship, yet you may get- one
able enough m carry voii and all your Goods back again
to Bwga£r or any-where else.
I told him,, I would take his Advice, when. I came- to
any Port where I, could find a Ship for my Turn, or get
any Customer to buy this. He replied, I should meet
with Customers enough, for the Ship at Nattqum, and-that
a Chinese junk would serve me very well to go back
again,; and that he would procure me People both to
buy one, and sell, the other.
Well, but, Seignor, fays I, as you fay they know the
Ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your Mea-
Aires, b«2 instrumental to bring some honest innocent
Men into a terrible Broil, and, perhaps, be murdered,
in^cold Blood; for where-ever they find the Ship, they
will prove the Guilt upon the Men, by proving this
was the Ship; and so innocent Men may probably be
overpowered and. murdered. Why, said the old Man,
I'll hnd out a Way to prevent that also; for as I know1
all those Commanders you speak of very well, and shall.
see them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them
to rights in the Thing, and let them know, that they had
been so much in the Wrong, that though the People
who were? on board at first, might run away with- the
Ship*, yet it was not true, that they had turned Pirates;
ani that in particular, those were not the Men that
first went? off with the Ship, but innocently bought Tier
for their Trade; and I am persuaded they will so far
believe me, as, at least, to act more cautiously foivthe
time, to come. Well, said I, and will you deliver one
Message:to them from me? Yes, I will/fays, he, if you
wilLgive it under.your Hand, in Writing, that 1 may
be ahl& to > prove, it came from you, and not out of
my own Head. I answered, That I would readily give
it him' under my Hand. So I took" a Pen, and Ink,
and Papery and wrote - at large the. Story of assaulting.
me
me with the Long-boats, &c. the pretended Reason of
it, and the unjust cruel Design of it and concluded to
the Commanders, that they had done what they not
only should have been ashamed of, but also, that if ever
they came to England, and I lived to fee them there,
they Ihould all pay dearly for it, if the Laws of my
Country were not grown out of Use before I arrived
there.
. My old Pilot read this over and over again, and asked
me several times, If I would stand to it. I answered, I
would stand to it as long as I had any thing left in
the World; being sensible that I should, one time or
other, find an Opportunity to put it home to them.
But we had no Occasion ever to let the Pilot cany this
Letter; for he never went back again. While those
Things were parsing between us, by way of Discourse,
we went forward directly for Nanquin, and, in about
1-3 Days Sail, came to an Anchor at the South-west
Point of the great Gulph of Nanqmn; where, by the
way, I came by Accident to understand, that the two
Dutch Ships were gone that Length before me, and
that I should certainly fall into their Hands. I con-
sulted my Partner again in this Exigency, and he was
as much at a Loss as I was, and would very gladly
have been safe on shore almost any-where. However,
I-was not in such Perplexity neither, but I alked the
old Pilot, If there was no Creek, or Harbour, which I
might put into, and pursue my Business with the Chi,
nese privately, and be in no Danger of the Enemy?
He told me, If I would fail to the Southward about
two-and-forty Leagues, there was a little Port called
£htinchangy where the Fathers of the Mission usually
landed from Macao f on their Progress to teach the
^Christian Religion to the Chinese* > and where no Eu-
ropean Ships ever put in; and if I thought to put in
there, I might consider what farther Course to take
when I was on shore. He confessed, he said, it was
not a Place for Merchants, except that at some certain
Times they had a kind of a Fair there, when the Mer-
chants from Japan came .over thither to buy the Chinese
Merchandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this Place; the Name
of the Port, as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell wrong;
 
for I do not particularly remember it, having lost this
together with the Names of many other Places set down
in a little Pocket-book, which was spoiled by the Wa-
ter, on an Accident which I shall relate in its Order; but
this I remember, that the Chinese or Japanese Merchants
we correspond with, called it by a different Name from'
that which our Portuguese Pilot gave it, and pronounced
it as above, Quinchang.
As we were unanimous in oar Resolutions to go
to this Place, we weighed the next Day, having only
gone twice on stiore, where we were to get fresh Wa-
ter; on both which Occasions the People of the Coun-
try were very civil to us, and brought us abundance
of Things to fell to us; I mean of Provisions, Plants,
Roots, Tea, Rice, and some Fowls; but nothing with-1
out Money.
We came to the other Port (the Wind being con-
trary) not till five Days, but it was very much to our
Satisfaction; and I was joyful, and, I may fay, thankful,
when I set my Foot safe on shore ; resolving, and my
Partner too, that if it was possible to dispose of our-
selves and Effects any other way, though not every
way to our Satisfaction, we would never let one Foot
on board that unhappy Vessel more; and, indeed, I
must acknowlege, that of all the Circumstances of Life,
that ever I had any Experience of, nothing makes Man-
kind so completely miserable, as that of being in con-
stant Fear. Well does the Scripture fay, The Fear of
Man brings a Snare; it is a Life of Death; and the Mind
is so intirely suppressed by it, that it is capable of no
Relief; the animal Spirits iink, aud all the Vigour of
Nature, which usually supports Men under other Af-
flictions, and is present to them in the greatest Exigen-
cies, fails them here.
Nor did it fail1 of its usual Operations upon the Fancy,
by heightening every Danger, representing the English
and Dutch Captains to be Men uncapable of hearing Rea-
son, or distinguishing between honest Men and Rogues;
or between a Story calculated for our own Turn, made
out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a true ge-
nuine Account of our whole Voyage, Progress, and De-
sign; for we might many ways have convinced any
reasonable Creature, that we were not Pirates j the
Goods
Goods we had on board, the Course we steered, Ouf
frankly shewing ourselves, and entering into such and
such Ports even our very Manner, the Force we had*
the Number of Men, the few Arms, little Ammuni-
tion, sliort Provisions; all these would have served to
convince any Man, that we were no Pirates. The Opi-
um, and other Goods, we had on board, would make
it appear the Ship had been at Bengal j the Dutchmen*
who, it was said, had the Names of all the Men that
were in the Ship,, might easily fee, that we werd a Mix-
ture of Englijh, Portuguese^ and Indians^ and but two
Dutchmen on board. These, and many other particu-
lar Circumstances might have made it evident to the
Understanding of any Commander, whose Hands we
might fall into, that we were no Pirates.
But Fear, that blind useless Passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the Vapours; it bewildered
our Understandings, and set the Imagination at work,
to form a thousand terrible Things, that, perhaps,
might never happen; we first supposed, as, indeed,
every body had related to us, that the Seamen on board
the English and Dutch Ships, but especially the Dutchy
were so enraged at the Name of a Pirate, and especi-
ally at our beating of therr Boats, and escaping, that
they would not give themselves leave to inquire, whe-
ther we were Pirates or no; but would execute us off-
hand, as we call it, withoat giving us any room for a
Defence. We reflected, that there was really so much
apparent Evidence before them, that they would scarce
inquire aster any more ; as, first, That the Ship was
certainly the fame, and that some of the Seamen among
them knew her, and had been on board her; and, se-
condly, That when we had Intelligence at the River
Cambodia, that they were coming down to examine us,
we fought their Boats, and fled •; so that we made no
Pirates, as we were satisfied of the contrary; and I
often said, I knew not but I should have been apt to
fcave taken the like Circumstances for Evidence, if the
Tables were turned, and my Cafe was- theirs; and have
made no Scruple of cutting all the Crew to~pieces, with-
out believing, or^ perhaps, considering, what they might
have to offer in their Defence.
doubt
 
were as fully satisfied of oar being
But
But let that be how it will, those were our Appre-
hensions; and both my Partner and I too scarce slept a
Night without dreaming of Halters, and Yard-arms;
that is to fay, Gibbets? of Fighting, and being taken;
of Killing, and being killed; and one Night I was in
such a Fury in my Dream, fansying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their. Seamen
down, that I struck my double Fist against the Side of
the Cabin I lay in, with such a .Force as wounded my
Hand most grievously, broke my Knuckles, and cut and
bruised the Flelh; so that it not only waked me out' of
my Sleep, but I was once afraid I should have lost two
of my Fingers.
Another Apprehension I had, was, of the cruel Usage
we should meet with from them, if we fell into their
Hands: Then the Story of Amboyna came into my
Head, and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us,,
as they did our Countrymen there ; and make some of
our Men, by Extremity of Torture, confess those Crimes
they never were guilty of; own themselves, and all of
us, to be Pirates; and so they would put us to Death,
with a formal Appearance of Justice; and that they
might be tempted to do this, for the Gain of our Ship
and Cargo, which was worth four or five thousand
Pounds,. put all together.
These Things tormented me, and my Partner too,
Night and Day ; nor did we consider, that the Captains
of Ships have no Authority to act thus ; and if we had
surrendered Prisoners to them, they could not answer'
the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be ac-,
countable for it when they came into their own Coun-
try. This, I fay, gave me no Satisfaction ; for if they
will act thus with us, what Advantage would it be to*
us, that they would be called to Account for it; or, if
we were first to be murdered, what Satisfaction would
it be to us, to have them punished when they cafne
Home?
I cannot refrain taking notice here, what Reflections
I now had, upon the past Variety* of my particular
Circumstances; how hard I thought it was, that I,'
who had spent forty Years in a Life of continued Dif-
ficulties, and was, at last, come, as it were, at the Port
or Haven which all Men drive at, <v>zt to have Re£
V o u IL D d and
and Plenty, should be a Volunteer in new Sorrows, by
my own unhappy Choice; and that I, who had escaped
so many Dangers in my Youth, should now come to
be hanged in my old Age, and in so remote a Place,
for a Crime I was not in the least inclined to, mucfo
less guilty of; and in a Place and Circurostance, where
Innocence was 'not like to be any Protection at all to
me.
• After these Thoughts, something of Religion would
come in; and I would be considering, that this seemed
to me to be a Disposition of immediate Providence ; and
I ought to look upon it, and submit to it, as such;
that although I was innocent as to Men, I was far from
being innocent as to my Maker ,• and I ought to look
in, and examine what other Crimes in my Life were
most obvious to me, and for which Providence might
justly inflict this Punishment, as a Retribution ; and that
I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a Ship-
wreck, if it had pleased God to have brought such a
Disaster upon me.
In its Turn, natural Courage would sometimes take
its Place; and then I would be talking myself up to
vigorous Resolutions, that I would not be taken, to be
barbarously used by a Parcel of merciless Wretches in
cold Blood that it was much better to have fallen into
the Hands of the Savages, who were Men-eaters, and
who, I was sure, would feast upon me, when they had
taken me, than by those, who would perhaps, glut
their Rage upon me, by inhuman Tortures and Bar-
barities; that, in the Cafe of the Savages, I always re-
solved to die fighting, to the last -Gasp; and why mould
I not do so now, feeing it was much more dreadful,
to me at least, to think of falling into these Mens
Hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten by
Men? For the Savages, give them their Due, would
not eat a Man till he was dead ; and killed him first, as-
we do a Bullock; but that these Men had many Arts
beyond the Cruelty of Death. Whenever these Thoughts
prevailed, I was sure to put myself into a kind of Fever,
with the Agitations of a supposed Fight; my Blood
would boil, and my Eyes sparkle, as if I was engaged;
and I always resolved, that I would take no Quarter at
their Hands; but even at last, if I could resist no longer,
I would:
3 would blow up the Ship, and all that was in her, and
leave them but little Boot/ to boast of.
But how much the greater Weight the Anxieties and,
Perplexities of these Things were to our Thoughts
while we were at Sea, by so much the greater was
our Satisfaction, when we saw ourselves on shore;
and my Partner told me he dreamed, That he had 3
very heavy Load upon his Back, which he was to carry
up an .Hill, and found that he was not able to stand long
under it; but the Portuguese Pilot came, and took it off
Jiis Back, and the Hill disappeared, the Ground before
him mewing all smooth and plain: And^ truly it was
so ; we were all like Men who had a Load taken off
their Backs.
For my part, I had a Weight taken off from my
Heart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and, as
I said above, we resolved to go no more to Sea in that
Ship. When we came on more, the old Pilot, who
was now our Friend, got us a Lodging, and a Ware-
house for our Goods, which, by the way, was much
the fame; it was a little House or Hut, with a large
Jiouse joining to it, all built with Canes, and palisadoed
round with large Canes, to keep out pilfering Thieves,
of which it seems there were not a few in the Country.
However, the Magistrates allowed us also a little Guard,
and we had a Soldier with a kind of Halbert, or Half-
pike, who stood Centinel at our Door; to whom we
allowed a Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Money,
about the Value of three Pence, per Day, so that our
-Goods were kept very safe.
The Fair or Mart, usually kept in this Place, had been
over some Time; however, we found that there were
three or four Junks in the River, and two Japanners> I
mean, Ships from Japan, with Goods which they had
.bought in China, and were not gone away, having Ja-
panese Merchants on more.
The first thing our old Portuguese Pilot did for us,
was, to bring us acquainted with three Missionary Ro~
tfiijh Priests, who were in the Town, and who had
been there some time, converting the People to Chri-
stianity ; but we. thought they made but poor Work
of it, and made them but sorry Christians when they
had done. However, that was not our Business. One
D d 2 of
of these was a Frenchman, whom they called Father
Simon; he was a jolly well-conditioned Man, very free
in his Conversation, not seeming so serious and grave
as the other two did; one of whom was a Portuguese,
and the other a Genoese; but Father Simon was cour-
teous, easy in his Manner, and very agreeable Company;
the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and
austere, and applied seriously to the Work they came
about, viz. to talk with, and insinuate themselves
among the Inhabitants, where-ever . they had Oppor-
tunity: We often eat and drank with those Men:
And though I must confess, the Conversion, as they
call it, of the Chinescs to Christianity, is so far from
the true Conversion required, to bring Heathen People
to the Faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little
more than letting them know the Name of Christ, fay
some Prayers to the Virgin Mary, and her Son, in a
Tongue which they understand not, and to cross them-
selves, and the like; yet it must be confessed, that these
Religious, whom we call Missionaries, have a firm Be-
lief, that these People mall be saved, and that they arc
the Instrument of it; and, on this Account, they un-
dergo not only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards
of living in such Places, but oftentimes Death itself, with
the most violent Tortures, for the fake of this Work;
and it would be a great Want of Charity in us, what-
ever Opinion we have of the Work itself, and the Man-
ner of their doing it, if we should not have a good
'Opinion of their Zeal, who undertake it with so many
Hazards, and who have no Prospect of the least temporal
Advantage to themselves. '*
But to return to my Story: This French Priest, Fa-
ther Simon, was appointed, it seems, by Order of the
Chief of the Mission, to go up to Peking, the Royal
Seat of the Chinese Emperor ; and waited only for an-
other Priest, who was ordered to come to him from
Macao, to go along with him; and we scarce ever
met together, but he was inviting me to go that Jour-
ney with him, telling me, How he would shew me all the
glorious Things of that mighty Empire; and among
the rest, the greatest City in the World ; a City, said
he, that your London and our Paris, put together, can-
not be equal to. This was the City of Peking, which, I
confess,
confess, is very great, and infinitely full of People; but,
as I looked on those Things with different Eyes from
other Men, so I shall give my Opinion of them in few-
Words, when I come, in the Course of my Travels, to
speak more particularly of them.
But first, I come to my Friar, or Missionary : Dine-,
ing with him one Day, and being very merry toge-
ther, I mewed some little Inclination to go with him
and he pressed me and my Partner very hard, and
with a great many Persuasions, to consent. Why,
Father Simon, fays my Partner, why* mould you de-
sire our Company so much? You know we are Here-
tics, and you do not love us, nor can keep us Com-
pany with any Pleasure. O ! says he, you may, per-
haps, be good Catholics in time; my Business here is
to convert Heathens; and who knows but I may con-
vert you too? Very well, Father, said I; so you will
preach to us all the Way. I won't be troublesome to
you, said he ; our Religion does not divest us of good
Manners ; besides, said he, we are here like Country-
men; and so we are, compared to the Place we are in;
and if you are Hugonots, and I a Catholic, we may
be all Christians at last; at least, said he, we are all
Gentlemen, and we may converse so/ without being-
uneasy to one another. I liked that Part of his Di£
course very well, and it began to put me in mind of
my Priest, that I had left in the Brasih; but this Fa-
ther Simon did not come up to his Character by a great
deal; for though Father Simon had no Appearance of a
criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had not that
Fund of Christian Zeal, strict Piety, and sincere Af-
fection to Religion, that my other good Ecclesiastic had,-
of whom I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us,
nor soliciting us to go with him; but we had some-
thing else before us at that time ; for we had all this
while our Ship, and our Merchandize, to dispose of;
and we began to be very doubtful what we mould
do, for we were now in a Place of very little Busi-
ness; and once I was about to venture to fail for the
River of Kilam, and the City of Nanquin: But Provi-
dence seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than
ever, to concern itself in our Affairs; and I was en-
couraged
tararaged from this very time to think, I should, one
way or other, get out of this tangled Circumstance,
and be brought Home to my own Country again;
though I had not the least View of the Manner; and,
when I began sometimes to think of it, could not
imagine by what Method it was to be de>ne. Provi-
dence, I fay, began here to clear up our way a little;
and the first thing that offered was, that our old Por-
tuguese Pilot brought a Japan Merchant to us, wh®
began to inquire what Goods we had; and, in the
iirst place, he bought all our Opium, and gave us a
very good Price for it, paying us in Gold by Weight,
some in small Pieces of their own Coin, and some in
small Wedges, of about ten or eleven Ounces each.
While we were dealing with him for our Opium, it
came into my Head, that he might, perhaps, deal with
us for the Ship too ; and I ordered the Interpreter to
propose it to him. He shrunk up his Shoulders at it,
when it was first proposed to him but, in a few Days
after, he came to me, with one of the Missionary Priests
for his Interpreter, and told me, He had a Proposal to
make to me, and that was this: He had bought a
great Quantity of Goods of us, when he had no
Thoughts (or Proposals made to him) of buying the
Ship; and that, therefore, he had not Money enough
to pay for the Ship; but if I would let the fame Men
who were in the Ship navigate her, he would hire
the Ship to go to Japan, and would fend them from
thence to the Philippine Islands with another Loading,
which he would pay the Freight of, before they went
from Japan; and that at their Return he would buy
the Ship. I began to listen to this Proposal, and so
eager did my Head still run upon Rambling, that I
could not but begin to entertain a Notion myself of
going with him, and so to sail from the Philippine
islands, away to the Soutb-Seas; and accordingly 1
asked the Japanese Merchant, if he would not hire us
to the Philippine Islands, and discharge us there. He
said, No, he could not do that; for then he could not
have the Return of his Cargo; but he would discharge
hs in Japan, he said, at the Ship's Return. Well, still
I was for taking him at that Proposal, and going my.
self j but my Partner, wiser than myself, persuaded^ me
from it, representing the Dangers, as well of the Seas,
as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and trea-
cherous People; and then of the Spaniards at the Phi-
lippines, snore false, more cruel, more treacherous, thaa
they.
Bat to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Con-
clusion; the first thing we had to do, was, to consult
with the Captain of the Ship, and -with the Men, and
know if they were willing to go to Japan; and, while
I was doing this, the young Man, whom, as I said, my
Nephew had left with me as my Companion for ray
Travels, came to me, and told me, that he thought that
Voyage promised very fair, and that there was a great
Prospect of Advantage, and he would be very glad if I
undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give
him Leave, he would go as a Merchant, or how Ipleaietl
to order him; that if ever he came to England, and I
was there, and alive, he would render me a faithful
Account of his Success, and it should be as much mine
as I pleased.
J was really loth to part with him ; tut, consider-
ing the Prospect of Advantage, which was really con-
siderable, and that he was a young Fellow as likely to
do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go;
but first I told him, I would consult my Partner, and
give him an Answer the next Day. My Partner and
1 discoursed about it; and my Partner made a most
generous Offer: He told me, You know it has been an
unlucky Ship, and we both resolve not to go to Sea in
it again ; is your Steward (so he called my Man) will
venture the Voyage, I'll leave my Share of the Vessel to
him, and let him make the best of it; and if we live to
meet in England, and he meets with Success abroad, he
snail account for one half os the Profits of the Ship's
Freight to us, the other Ilia 11 be his own.
If my Partner, who was no way concerned with
my young Man, made him such an Offer, I could do
no less than offer him the fame; and all the Ship's
Company being willing to go with him, we made over
half the Ship to him in Property, and took a Writing
from him, obliging him to account for the other; and
away he went to Japan. The Japan Merchant proved
a very punctual honest Man to him, protected him ac
1 7a*xnr
Japan, and got him a Licence to come on shore, which
the Europeans in general have not lately obtained; paid
him his Freight very punctually, sent him to the Philip-
pines, loaded with Japan and China Wares, and a Su-
pracargo of their own, who, trafficking with the Spa-
niards, brought back European Goods again, and a great
Quantity of Cloves, and other Spice; and there he was
not only paid his Freight very well, and at a very good
Price, but, being not willing to fell the Ship then, the
Merchant furnished him with Goods on his own Ac-
count; that for some Money, and some Spices of his
own, which he brought with him, he went back to the
Manillas, to the Spaniards, where he fold his Cargo very
well. Here, having gotten a good Acquaintance at
Manilla, he got his Ship made a free Ship; and the
Governor of Manilla hired him to go to Accapuko in
America, on the Coast of Mexico; and gave him a Li-
cence to land there, and travel to Mexico, and to pass in
any Spanijh Ship to Europe, with all his Men.
He made the Voyage to Accapuko very happily, and
there he fold his Ship; and having there also obtained
Allowance to travel by Land to Porto Bcllo, he found
means, some how or other, to go to Ja?naica with all
his Treasure; and about eight Years after came to
England exceeding rich; of which I shall take Notice
in its Place ; in the mean time, I return to our particu-
lar Affairs.
Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Com-
pany, it came before us, of course, to consider what
Recompence we mould give to the two Men, that
give us such timely Notice of the Design against: us in
the River of Cambodia. The Truth was, they had done
us a considerable Service, and deserved well at our
Hands; though, by the way, they were a couple of
Rogues too; for, as they believed the Story of our be-
ing Pirates, and that we had really run away with the
Ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the
Design that was formed against us, but to go to Sea
with us as Pirates ; and one of them confeifed after-
wards, that nothing else but the Hopes of going a
Roguing, brought him to do it. However, the Ser-
vice they did us was not the less ; and therefore, as I
had promised to be grateful to them, I mil: ordered the.
Money
Money to be paid to djem, which they said was due
to them on board their respective Ships; that is to
fay, the Englishman nineteen Months Pay, and to the
Dutchman seven ; and, over and above that, I gave each
of them a small Sum of Money in Gold, which con-
tented them very well, then I made the Englishman Gun-
ner in the Ship, the Gunner being now made Second
Mate and Purler; the Dutchman I made Boatswain;
so they were both very well pleased, and proved very
serviceable, being both able Seamen, and very stout
Pellows.
We'were now on shore in China. If I thought myself
banished, and remote from my own Country, at Bengal,
where. I had many ways to get Home for my Money,
what could I think of myself now, when I was gotten
about a thousand Leagues farther off from Home,
and perfectly destitute of all manner of Prospect of
Return \
All we had for it was this; that in about four
Months time there was to be another Fair at that
Place where we were, and then we might be able to
purchase all Sorts of the Manufactures of* the Country,
and withal might possibly find some Chinese Junks or
Veslels from Nanquin, that would be to be fold, and
would cany us and our Goods whither we pleased.
This I liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides,
as our particular Persons were not obnoxious,- so if any
Engli/h or Dutch Ships came thither, perhaps we might
have an Opportunity to load our Goods, and get Passage
to some other Place in India nearer Home.
Upon these Hopes we resolved to continue here ;~
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three Jour-
neys into the Country; first we went ten Days Jour-
ney to fee the City of Nanquin, a City well worth
seeing indeed; they say it has a Million of People in
it; which, however, I do not believe; it is regularly-
built, the Streets all exactly strait, and cross one ano-
ther, in direct Lines, which gives the Figure of it great
Advantage.
But when I came to compare the miserable People
of these Countries with ours ; their Fabrics, thejr Man-
ner of Living, their Government, their Religion, their
Vol. IL N°. 2*, E e , . Wealth,
Wealth, and their Glory (as some call it) I must: con-
fess, I do not so much as think it worth naming, or
worth my while to write of, or any that shall come after
me to read.
It is very observable, that we wonder at the Gran-
deur, the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Go-
vernment, the Manufactures, the Commerce, and the
Conduct of these People; not that it is to be wondered
at, or indeed, in the least, to be regarded; but because,
having first a Notion of the Barbarity of those Coun-
tries, the Rudeness, and the Ignorance that prevail
there, we do not expect to find any such things so
far off.
Otherwise, what are their Euildings to the Palaces
and Royal Buildings of Europe? What their Trade, to
the universal Commerce of England, Holland, France,
and Spain? What their Cities to ours, for Wealth,
Strength, Gaiety of Apparel, rich Furniture, and an in-
finite Variety? What are their Ports supplied with a
few Junks and Barks, to our Navigation, our Mer-
chants Fleets, our large and powerful Navies? Our
City of London has more Trade than all their mighty
Empire. One Englijh, or Dutch, or French Man of
War of 80 Guns, would fight with, and destroy all
the Shipping of China. But the Greatness of their
Wealth, their Trade, the Power of their Government,
and Strength of their Armies, is surprising to us, be-
cause, as I have said, considering them as a barbarous
Nation of Pagans, little better than Savages, we did
not expect such Things among them ; and this, indeed,
is the Advantage with which all their Greatness and
Power is represented to us; otherwise it is in itself
nothing at all ; for, as I have said of their Ships, so
rpay be said os their Armies and Troops; all the Forces
of their Empire, though they were to bring two Mil-
lions of Men ipto the Field together, would be able to
do nothing but ruin the Country, and starve themselves.
Jf they were to besiege a strong Town in Slanders, or
to fght a disciplined Army, one Line of German Cui-
ra fliers, or a French Cavalry, would overthrow all the
Horse of China; a Million of their Foot could not
stand before one-embattled Body of our Infantry, posted
sq
so as not to be surrounded, though they were not to
be one to twenty in Number; nay, I do not boast, if I
say, that 30,000 Gertnan or English Foot, and 10,000
French Horse, would fairly beat all the Forces of China.
And so of our fortified Towns, and of the Art of ouf
Engineers, in assaulting and defending Towns; there is
not a fortified Town in China could hold out one Month,
against the Batteries and Attacks of an European Army;
and at the fame time, all the Armies of China could
never take such a Town as Dunkirk, provided it was
not starved; no, not in ten Years Siege. They have
Fire arms, it is true; but they are aukward, clumsy,
and uncertain in going off; they have Powder, but it
is of no Strength; they have neither Discipline in the
Field, Exercise to their Arms, Skill to attack, or Tem-
per to retreat; and therefore I must confess, it seemed
strange to me, when I came Home, and heard our Peo-
ple say such fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glory,
Magnificence, and Trade of the Chinese, because I saw
and knew, that they were a contemptible Herd or
Croud of ignorant sordid Slaves, subjected to a Go-
vernment qualified only to rule such a People; and, in
a Word, for I am now launched quite beside my Design,
I say, in a Word, were not its Distance inconceivably
great from Muscovy, and were not the Muscovite Em-
pire almost as rude, impotent, and ill-governed a Croud
of Slaves as they, the Czar of Miscovy might, with
much Ease, drive them all out of their Country, and
conquer them in one Campaign; and had the Czar,
who I since hear is a growing Prince, and begins to
appear formidable in the World, fallen this Way, instead
of attacking the warlike Swedes, in which Attempt none
of the Powers of Europe would have envied or inter-
rupted him ; he might, by this time, have been Em-
peror of China, instead of being beaten by the King
Of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to
s;x in Number. As their Strength aud their Grandeur,
so their Navigation, Commerce, and Husbandry, is im-
perfect and impotent, compared to the fame Things
in Europe; also, in their Knowlege, their Learning, their
Skill in the Sciences, they have Globes and Spheres,
and a Smatch of the Knowlege of the Mathematics;
Ee 2 feat
but when you come to inquire into their Knowlegey
how short-sighted are the wisest of their Students!
they know nothing of the Motion of the heavenly Bo-
dies; and so grosty, absurdly ignorant, that when the
$un is eclipsed, they think it is a great Dragon has as-
saulted and run away with it, and they fall a clattering;
with all the Drums and Kettles in the Country, to
fright the Monster away, just as we do to hive a Swarm
of Bees.
* As this is the only Excursion of this kind which I
have made in all the Account I have given of my
Travels, so I shall make no more Descriptions of Coun-
tries and People; it is none of my Business, or any Part
of my Design; but, giving an Account of my own Ad-
ventures, through a Life of inimitable Wanderings, and
a long Variety of Changes, which, perhaps, few have
heard the like of, I shall say nothing of the mighty
Places, desart Countries, and numerous People, I have
yet to pass through, more than relates to my own
Story, and which my Concern among them will make
necessary. I was now, as near as I can compute, in
the Heart of China, about the Latitude of thirty De-
grees North of the Line, for we were returned from
Nanquin; I had indeed a mind to fee the City of Pe-
king, which J had heard so much of, and Father Simon
importuned me daily to do it; at length his Time of
going away being set, and the other Missionary, who
was to go with nim, being arrived from Macao, it
was necessary, that we should resolve either to go, or
not to go ,* . so I referred him to my Partner, and left
it wholly to his Choice; who, at length, resolved it
in the Affirmative; and we prepared for our Journey.
We set out with very good Advantage, as to finding
the Way; for we got Leave to travel in the Retinue of
one of their, Mandarins, a kind of Viceroy, or principal
Magistrate, in the Province where they reside, and who
take great State upon them, travelling with great AtT
tendance, and with great Homage from the People,,
who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them,
because all the Countries they pass through are obliged
to furnish Provisions for them, and all their Attendants,
That which I particularly observed, as to oux travelling.
r with
with his Baggage, was this; that though we received
sufficient Provisions, both for ourselves and our Horses,
from the Country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet
we were obliged to pay for every thing we had, after
the Market-price of the Country, and the Mandarin's
Steward, or Commissary of the Provisions, collected it
duly from us, so that our travelling in the Retinue of
the Mandarin, though it was a very great Kindness to
us, was not such a mighty Favour in him, but was,
indeed, a great Advantage to him, considering there
were about thirty other People travelled in the fame
manner besides us, under the Protection of his Reti-
nue, or, as we may call it, under his Convoy. This,
I fay, was a great Advantage to him; for the Country
furnished all the Provisions for nothing, and he took all
our Money for them.
We were five-and-twenty Days travelling to Peking?
through a Country infinitely populous, but miserably
cultivated, the Husbandry, Oeconomy, and the Way
of Living, all very miserable, though they boast so
much of the Industry of the People ; I sayr miserable j
and so it is, if we, who understand bow to live, were
to endure it, or to compare it with our own. but not
so to these poor Wretches, who know no other. The
Pride of these People is infinitely great, and exceeded by
nothing but their Poverty, which adds to that which.
I call their Misery. I must needs think the naked Sa-
vages of America live much more happy, because, as they
have nothing, fa they desire nothing; whereas these are
proud and insolent, and, in the main, are mere Beggars
and Drudges; their Ostentation is inexpressible, and is
chiefly shewed in their Cloaths and Buildings, and in the
keeping Multitudes ^of Servants or Slaves, and, which is
to the last Degree ridiculous, their Contempt of all the
World but themselves.
I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards-
in the Desarts and vast Wildernesses of Grand Tartars $
than here; and yet the Roads here are well paved, and
well kept, and very convenient for Travellers; but no*
thing was more aukward to me, than to fee. such au
haughty, imperious, insolent People, in the midst of
the grossest Simplicity and Ignorance; for all their famed.
Ingenuity
Ingenuity is no more. My Friend Father Simon and t
used to be very merry upon these Occasions, to fee the
beggarly Pride of those People; for Example, coming
by the House of a Country Gentleman, as Father Simon
called him, about ten Leagues off from the City of Nan-
quiny we had, first of all, the Honour to ride with the
Master of the House, about two Miles ; the State he
rode in, was a perfect Don Quixctism, being a Mixture
of Pomp and Poverty.
The Habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a
Scaramouch, or Merry-Andrew; being a dirty Ccillico,
with all the tawdry Trappings of a Fool's Coat, such as
Hanging-Sleeves, Taffety, and Cuts and Slashes almost on
every Side; it covered a rich TafFety Vest, as greasy as a
Butcher, and which testified, that his Honour must needs
be a most exquisite Sloven.
His Horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling Crea-
ture, such as in England might fell for about 30 or 40
Shillings ; and he had two Slaves followed him on Foot,
to drive the poor Creature along; he had a Whip in
his Hand, and he belaboured the Beast as fast about the
Head as his Slaves did about the Tail; and thus he rode
by us with about ten or twelve Servants, and we were
told he was going from the City to his Country Seat,
about half a League before us. We travelled on gently,
but thi^ Figure of a Gentleman rode away before us;
and as we stopped at a Village about an Hour to refresh
us, when we came by the Country Seat of this great
Man, we saw him in a little Place, before his Door,
eating his Repast; it was a kind of a Garden, but he
was easy to be seen, and we were given to understand,
that the more we looked on him, the better he would
be pleased.
I-Je sat under a Tree, something like the Palmetto -
Tree, which effectually shaded him over the Head, and
on the South-side; but under the Tree also was placed
a large Umbrella, which made that Part look well
enough; he fat lolling back in a great Elbow-Chair,
being a heavy corpulent Man, and his Meat being
brought him by two Women Slaves ; he had two.more,
whose Office, I think, few Gentlemen in Europe would
accept os their Service in, viz. Que fed the 'Squire-
with
with a Spoon, and the other held the Dish with one
Hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his Wor-
ship's Beard, and Taffety Vest, with the other ; while
the great fat Brute thought it below him to employ his
own Hands in any of those familiar OfEees, which Kings
and Monarchs would rather do, than be troubled with
the clumsy Fingers of their Servants.
I took this Time to think what Pains Mens Pride puts
them to; and how troublesome a haughty Temper,
thus ill managed, must be to a Man of common Sense;
and, leaving the poor Wretch to please himself with our
looking at him, as if we admired his Pomp, whereas
we really pitied and contemned him, we pursued our
Journey; only Father Simon had the Curiosity to stay
to inform himself what Dainties the Country Justice
had to feed on, in all his State; which he said he had
the Honour to taste of, and which was, I think, a Dose
that an Englijb Hound would scarce have eaten, if it
had been oTfered him, *viz. a Mess of boiled Rice, with
a great Piece of Garlick in it, and a little Bag silled with
Green Pepper, and another Plant which they have there,
something like our Ginger, but smelling like Must:,
and tasting like Mustard; all this was put together, and'
a small Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boiled in it; and
this was his Worship's Repast, four or five Servants more
attending at a Distance. Jf he fed them meaner than he
was fed himself, the Spice excepted, they must fare Very
coarsly indeed.
As for our Mandarin, with whom we travelled, he
was respected like a King; surrounded always with his
Gentlemen, and attended in all his Appearances with
such Pomp, that I saw little of him but at a Distance $
but this I observed, that there was not an Horse in his
Retimie, but that our Carriers Pack-Horses in ExgLzxJ
seem to me to look much better but they were so co-
vered with Equipage, Mantles, Trappings and such-like
Trumpery, that you cannot see whether they are fat or
lean. In a Word, we could see scarce any thing but
their Feet and their Heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my Trouble and
Perplexity that I have given an Account of being over,
I had no anxious Thoughts about me; which made this
Journey
Journey much the pleasanter to me; nor had I any ill
Accident attended me, only in the passing or fording a
small River, my Horse fell, and made me free of the
Country, as they call it; that is to fay, threw me in;
the Place was not deep, but it wetted me all over : I
mention it because it spoiled my Pocket-book, wherein
1 had set down the Names of several People and Places
which I had Occasion to remember, and which not
taking due care of, the Leaves rotted, and the Words
were never after to be read, to my great Loss, as to the
Names of some Places which I touched at in this
Voyage.
At length we arrived at Peking; I had nobody with
me but the Youth, whom my Nephew the Captain had
given me to attend me as a Servant, and who proved
very trusty and diligent; and my Partner had nobody
with him but one Servant, who was a Kinsman. As
for the Portuguese Pilot, he being desirous to fee the
Court, we gave him his Passage, that is to *fay, bore
his Charges for his Company; and to use him as an
Interpreter, for he understood the Language of the
Country, and spoke good French > and a little English \
and, indeed, this old Man was a most useful Implement
to us every-where; for we had not been above a Week
at Peking, when he came laughing, Ah, Seignior In-
glesef said he, I have something to tell you, will make
your Heart glad. My Heart glad? said I; What can
that be ? I don't know any thing in this Country can
either give me Joy or Grief, to any great Degree. Yes,
yes, said the old Man, in broken Engli/h, make you
glad, me sorrow; sorry he would have said. This
made me more inquisitive. Why, said I, will it make
you sorry? Because, said he, you have brought me
here 25 Days Journey, and will leave me to go back
alone; and which Way mall I get to my Port afterwards,
without a Ship, without a Horse, without Pecune? So he
called Money; being his broken Latin; of which he had
abundance to make us merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great Caravan of
Muscovite and Polish Merchants in the City, and they
were preparing to set out on their Journey, by Land, to
Muscovy, within four or five Weeks and he was sure
we would take the Opportunity to go with them, and
leave
leave him behind to go back all alone. I confess, I
was surprised with his News; a secret Joy spread it-
self over my whole Soul, which I cannot describe, and
never felt before or since ; and I had no Power, for a
good while, to speak a Word to the old Man; but at
last I turned to him: How do you know this? said I: «
Are you sure it is true ? Yes, said he, I met this Morn-
ing, in the Street, an old Acquaintance of mine, an Ar~
txenian, or one you call a Grecian, who is among them;
he came last from Asrac an, and was designing to go
to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has al-
tered his Mind, and is now resolved to go ba^k with
the Caravan to Moscow, and so down the River of
Wolga to Asracan. Well, Seignior,, said I, do not be
uneasy about being^ left to go back alone; if this be a
Method for my Return to England, it shall be your
Fault, if you go back to Macao at all. We then went to
consulting together what was to be done, and asked my
Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News, and whe-
ther it would suit with his Affairs? He told me he
would do just as I would; for he had settled all his Af-
fairs so well at Bengal, and left his Effects in such good
Hands, that as we had made a good Voyage here, if he
could vest it in China Silks, wrought and raw, such as
might be worth the Carriage, he would be content to
go to England, and then make his Voyage back to Bengal
by the Company's Ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portugal Pilot would go with us, we would bear his
Charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased ; nor,
indeed, were we to be esteemed over-generous in that
Part neither, if we had not rewarded him farther j for
the Service he had done us was really worth all that,
and more ; for he had not only been a Pilot to us at
Sea, but he had been also like a Broker for us on shore;
and his procuring for us the Japan Merchant, was some
Hundreds of Pounds in our Pockets. So we consulted
together about it ; and, being willing to gratify him,
which was, indeed, but doing him Justice, and Very
willing also to have him with us besides, for he was
a most necessary Man on all Occasions, we agreed to
give him a Quantity of coined Gold, which, as I com-
Vol. II. F f pate
pute it, came to about 175 Pounds Sterling between us,
and to bear his Charges, both for himself and Horse,
except only a Horse to carry his Goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called him,
to let him know what we had resolved; I told him, he
had complained of our being like to let him go back
alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolved he
should not go back at all: That as we had resolved to.
go to Europe with the Caravan, we resolved also he
inould go with us, and that we called him to know
his Mind, He shook his Head, and said, it was a long
Journey, and he had no Pecune to carry him thither,
nor to subsist himself when he came thither, We told'
him, we believed it was so, and therefore we had re-
solved to do something for him, that should set him
see how sensible we were of the Service he had done
us ; and also how agreeable he was to us : And then I
told him what we had resolved to give him here,
which he might lay out as we would do our own; and
that as for his Charges, if he would go with us, we
would set him safe ashore, (Life and Casualties ex-
cepted) either in Muscovy or England, which he would,
at our own Charge, except only • the Carriage of his
Goods.
He received the Proposal like a Man transported, and
told us, he would go with us over the whole World;
and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves for the Jour-
ney. However, as it was with us, so it was with the
other Merchants; they had many things to do \ and
instead of being ready in five Weeks, it was four Months
and some odd Days before all Things were got toge-
ther.
It, was the Beginning of February, our Stile, when we
set out from Peking; my Partner and the old Pilot had
gone/Express back to the Port where we had first put
in, to dispose of some Goods which we had left there;
and. I, with a Chinese Merchant, whom I had some
Knowlege of at Nwquin, and who came to Peking on
his <>wn Affairs, we.nt to Navquin, where I bought
ninety Pieces of fine Damasks, with about two hundred
Pieces of other very fine Silks, of feyeral Sorts, some,
mixed with Gold, and had all these brought to Peking
against
against my Partner's Return; besides this, we bought
a very large Quantity of Raw Silk, and some other
Goods; our Cargo amounting, in these Goods only,
to about Three thousand five hundred Pounds Ster-
ling, which, together with Tea, and some fine Cal-
licoes, and three Camel-loads of Nutmegs and Cloves,
loaded in all eighteen Camels for our Share, besides
those we rode upon ; which, with two or three spare
Horses, and two Horses loaded with Provisions, made
us, in short, twenty-six Camels and Horses in our Re-
tinue.
The Company was very great, and, as near as I can
remember, made between three and four hundred Horse
and Camels, and upwards of an hundred and twenty
Men, very well armed, and provided for all Events.
For, as tne Eastern Caravans are subject to be attacked
by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars; but they are
not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barba-
rous when they prevail.
The Company consisted of People of several Nations,
such as Muscovites chiefly; for there Were above sixty of
them who were Merchants or Inhabitants of Moscow,
though of them some were Ll^jofiians^ and to our par-
ticular Satisfaction, five of them were Scots, who ap-
peared also to be Men of great Experience in Business,
and very good Substance.
When we had travelled one Day's Journey, the Guides,
who were five in Number, called all the Gentlemen and
Merchants; that is to fay, all the Passengers, except the
Servants, to a great Council, as they termed it. At this
great Council every one deposited a certain Quantity of
Money to a common Stock, for t^e necesiary Expence
of buying Forage on the Way, where it was not other-
wise to be had, and for satisfying the Guides, getting
Horses, and the like. And here they constituted the
Journey, as they called it, They named Captains
and Officers to draw us all up, and give the Command
in cafe of an Attack, and gave e^ery one their Turn of
Command. Nor was this forming us into Order any
more than what we found needful upon the Way, as
shall be observed in its Place.
Ff 2
The
The Road all on this Side of the Country is very po-
pulous, and is full of Potters, and Earth-makers, that
is to fay, People that tempered the Earth for the China
Ware; and, as I was going along, our Portugal Pilot,
who had always something or other to fay to make us
merry, came sneering to me, and told me, He would shew
me the greatest Rarity in all the Country; and that I
Ihould have this to fay of China, after all the ill-humoured
Things I had said of it, that I had seen one Thing which
was not to be seen in all the World beside. I was very
importunate to know what it was; at last he told me,
It was a Gentleman's House, built all with China Ware.
Well, said I, are not the Materials of their Building
the Product of their own Country; and so it is all
China Ware, is it not? No, no, fays he, I mean, it is a
Mouse all made of China Ware, such as you call so
in England; or, as it is called in our Country, Porcelain.
Well, said I, such a thing may be: How big is it?
Can we carry it in a Box upon a Camel? If we can,
we will buy it. Upon a Camel ! said the old Pilot,
holding up both his Hands ; why there is a Family of
thirty People lives in it.
I was then curious, indeed, to fee it; and when I came
to it, it was nothing but this ; it was a Timber House,
or a House built, as we call it in England, with Lath and
Plaister, but all the Plaistcring was really China Ware,
that is to fay, it was plaillered with the Earth that makes
China Ware.
The Outside, which the Sun shone hot upon, was
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and paint-
ed with blue Figures, as the large China Ware in England
is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt. As to
the Inside, all the Wails, instead of Wainscot, were lined
up with hardened and painted Tiles, like the little square
Tiles we call Gaily-Tiles in England, all made of the
finest China, and the Figures exceeding fine indeed, with
extraordinary Variety of Colours, mixed with Gold,
many Tiles making but one Figure,, but joined so-arti-
ficially with Mortar being made of the fame Earth, that
it was very hard to fee where the Tiles met. The
Floors of the Rooms were of the fame Composition*
and as hard as the earthen Floors we have in Use in-
several
5
several Parts of England, especially Lincolnshire, Notting-
hamshire, Leicester/hireyUc. as hard as Stone, and smooth,
but not burnt and painted, except some smaller'Rooms,
like Closets, which were all as it were paved with the
fame Tile; the Cielings, and, in a Word, all the Plai-
stering-work in the whole House, were of the same
Earth ; and, aster all, the Roof was covered with Tiles
of the fame, but of a deep shining Black.
This was a China Warehouse, indeed, truly and lite-
rally to be called so; and, had I not been upon the
Journey, I could have stayed some Days to fee and ex-
amine the Particulars of k. They told me there were
Fountains and Fish-ponds in the Garden, all paved at
the Bottom and Sides with the fame, and fine Statues
set up in Rows on the Walks, intirely formed of the
Porcelain Earth, and burnt whole.
As this is one of the Singularities of China, so they
may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they
excel in their Accounts of it; for they told me such in-
credible Things of their Performance in Crockery-
ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as know-
ing it could not be true: One told me, in particular,
of a Workman that made a Ship, with all its Tackle,
and Masts, and Sails, in Earthen-ware, big enough to
carry fifty Men. If he had told me he launched it, and
made a Voyage to Japan in it, I might have said some-
thing to it indeed; but as it was, I knew the whole
Story, which was, in short, asking Pardon for the Word,
that the Fellow ly'd; so I smiled, and said nothing
to it.
This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Ca-
ravan, for which the Leader of it for the Day, fined
me about the Value of three Shillings ; and told me, If
it had been three Days Journey without the Wall, as
it was three Days within, he must have fined me four
times as much, and made me alk Pardon the next
Council Day; so I promised to be more orderly; for,
indeed, I found afterwards, the Orders made for keep-
ing all together, were absolutely necessary for our com-
mon Safety. ~
In two Days more we passed the great China Wall,
made for a Fortification against the Tartan; and a very
grc&t
great Work it is, going over Hills and Mountains in an
endless Track, where the Rocks are impassable, and the
Precipices such as no Enemy could possibly enter, or,
indeed, climb up, or where, if they did, no Wall could
hinder them. They tell us, its Length is near a thou-
sand English Miles, but that the Country is five hun-
dred in a strait measured Line, which the Wall bounds,
without measuring the Windings and Turnings it takes;
'tis about four Fathom high, and as many thick in some
Places.
I stood still an Hour, or thereabout, without tres-
passing on our Orders, for so long the Caravan was in
passing the Gate; I fay, I stood still an Hour to look at
it on every Side, near, and far off, I mean, what was
within my View; and the Guide of our Caravan, who
had been extolling it for the Wonder of the World,
was mighty eager to . hear my Opinion of it. I told
him it was a most excellent thing to keep off the Tar-
tars; which he happened not to understand as I meant
it, and so took it for a Compliment; but the old Pilot
laugh'd; O Seignior Inglcse, said he, you speak in Co-
lours. In Colours ! said I; What do you mean by
that ? Why you speak what looks white this Way, and
black that Way gay one Way, and dull another Way;
you tell him it is a good Wall to keep out Tartars;
you tell me by that, it is good for nothing but to keep
out Tartars; or, it will keep ,out none but Tartars; I
understand you, Seignior Ingles, I understand you, said
he, joking; but Seignior Chinese understand you his
own way.
Well, said I, Seignior, do you think it would stand
out an Army of our Country People, with a good
Train of Artillery; or our Engineers, with two Com-
panies of Miners? Would they not batter it down in
ten Days, that an Army might enter in Battalia, or blow
it up into the Ah, Foundation and all, that there should
be no Sign of it left? Ay, ay, said he, I know that.
The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said,
and I gave him leave to tell him a sew Days after,
for we were then almost out of their Country, and
he was to leave us in a little time afterwards; but when
he knew what I had said, he was dumb all—fche rest
of
of the Way, and we heard no more of his fine Story of
the Chhtese Power and Greatness, while he ftay'd.
After we had passed this mighty Nothings called a Wall
something likæ the Picis Wall, so famous in Northumber-
land*, and built by the Romans, we began to find the
Country thinly inhabited, and the People rather 'con-
fined to live in fortified Towns and Cities, as being sub-
ject to the Inroads and Depredations of the Tartars, who
rob in great Armies, and therefore are not to be refilled
by the naked Inhabitants of an open Country,
And here I began to find the Necessity of keeping to-
gether in a Caravan, as we travelled ; for we saw several
Troops of "Tartars roving about; but when I came to lee
them distinctly, I wondered more that the Chinese Em-
pire could be conquered by such contemptible Fellows j
for they are a mere Herd or Croud of wild Fellows,
keeping no Order, and understanding no Discipline, or
manner of Fight.
Their Horses are poor, lean, starved Creatures, taught
nothing, and are fit for nothing ; and this we found
the first Day we saw them, which was after we en-
tered the wilder Part of the Country; our Leader for
the Day gave Leave for about .sixteen of us to go a
hunting, as they call it; and what was this but hunt^
ing of Sheep! However, it may be called Hunting too;
for the Creatures are the wildest, and swiftest of Foot,
that ever I saw of their kind; only they will' not run a
great Way; and you are sure of Sport when you begin,
tke Chace; for they appear generally by thirty or forty
in.a Flock, and, like true Sheep, always keep together
when they fly.
In Pursuit of this odd Sort of Game, it was our Hap,
to meet with about forty Tartars; whether they were
hunting Mutton as we were, or whether they looked
for another kind of Prey, I know not; but as soon as
they saw us, one of them blew a kind of Horn very
loud, but with a barbarous Sound that I had never
heard before; and, by the way, never care to hear
again. We all supposed this was to call their Friends,
abqut them ; and ib it was; for in less than half a
(Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of forty or fifty more-
appeared
appeared at about a Mile distance, but our Work was
over first, as it happened.
One of the Scots Merchants of Moscow happened to
be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the Horn, he
told us, in short, That we had nothing to do, qut to
charge them immediately, without Loss of Time; and,
drawing us up in a Line, he asked, If we were resolved?
We told him, We were ready to follow him : So he rode
directly up to them. They stood gazing at us like a
mere Crowd, drawn up in no Order, nor shewing the
Face of any Order at all; but as soon as they saw us
advance, they let fly their Arrows; which however
miffed us very happily; it seems they mistook not their
Aim, but their Distance; for their Arrows all fell a
little short of us, but with so true an Aim, that had we
been about twenty Yards nearer, we must have had se-
veral Men wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted; and though it was at a
great Distance, we fired, and sent them leaden Bullets
for wooden Arrows, following our Shot full Gallop,
resolving to fall in among them Sword in Hand ; for
fa our bold Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed,
but a Merchant, but he behaved with that Vigour and
Bravery on this Occasion, and yet with such a cool
Courage too, that I never saw any Man in Action fit-
ter for Command. As soon as we came up to them,
we fired our Pistols in their Faces, and then drew;
but they fled in the greatest Confusion imaginable;
the only Stand any of them made, was on our Right,
where three of them stood, and, by Signs, called the
rest to come back to them, having a kind of Scymitar
in their Hands, and their. Bows hanging at their BacKs.
Our brave Commander, without asking any body to
follow him, galloped up close to them, and with his
Fusil knocked one of them off his Horse, killed the
second with his Pistol, and the third ran away ,* and thus
ended our Fight: But we had this Misfortune attending
£t, viz. That all our Mutton that we had in Chace,
got away. We had not a Man killed or hurt; but,
as for the Tartars, there were about five of them killed;
hs>w many were wounded, we knew not; but this we
knew,-
knew, that the other Party was so frighted with the Noise
of our Guns, that they fled, and never made any At-
tempt upon us.
We were all this while in the. Chinese Dominion, and
therefore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards;
but in about five Days we entered a vast great wild De-
sert, which held us three Days and Nights March ; and
we were obliged to carry our Water with us in great
Leather Bottles, and to encamp all Night, just as I have
heard they do in the Deserts of Arabia.
I asked our Guides, Whose Dominion this was in?
and they told me, this was a kind of Border, that
might be called No Mans Land; being a Part of the
Great Karakathay, or Grand Tartary; but that how-
ever it was reckoned to China ; that there was no Care
taken here, to preserve it from the Inroads of Thieves;
and therefore it was reckoned the worst Desert in the
whole March, though we were to go over some much
Larger.
In passing this Wilderness, which, I confess, was at
the first View very frightful to me, we saw two or three
times little Parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be
upon their own Aifairs, and to have no Design upon
us; and so, like the Man who met the Devil, if they
had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to fay to them;
we let them go.
Once, however, a Party of them came so near, as
to stand and-gaze at us; whether it was to consider
what they mould do, viz. to attack us, or not attack us,
we knew not; but when we were passed at some Di-
stance by them, we made a Rear-guard of forty Men,
and stood ready for them, letting the Caravan pass
half a Mile, or thereabouts, before us: After a while
they marched off, only we found they assaulted us with
five Arrows at their parting; one of which wounded
a Horse, so that it disabled him; and we left him the
next Day, poor Creature, in great need of a good Far-
rier; we suppose they might shoot more Arrows, which
might fall snort of us; but we saw no more Arrows, or
Tartars, at that Time.
We travelled near a Month after this, the Ways being
not so good at first, though still in the Dominions of
You II. Gg the
the Emperor of China,; but lay, for the most part, in
Villages, some of which were fortified, because of the
Incursions of the Tartars. When we came to one of
these Towns (it was about two Days and an half's
Journey before we were to come to the City of Naum),
I wanted to buy a Camel, of which there are plenty
to be fold all the Way upon that Road, and of Horses
also, such as they are, because so many Caravans com-
ing that Way, they are very often wanted. The Per-
son that I spoke to, to get me a Camel, would have
gone and fetched it for me; but I, like a Fool, must
be officious, and go. myself along with him. The
Place was about twa Miles out of the Village, where,
it seems., they kept the Camels, and Horses feeding un-
der a Guard.
I walked it on Foot, with my old Pilot in Company,
and a Chinese, being a little desirous, forsooth, of a little
Variety. When we came to this Place, it was a low
marshy Ground, walled round with a Stone Wall, piled
up dry, without Mortar or Earth among it, like a
Park, with a little Guard of Chinese Soldiers at the Doors.
Having bought a Camel;, and agreed for the Price, I
came away; and the Chimse Man, that went with me,
led. the Camel; when on a sudden, came up five Tar-
tars on Horseback; twa of them seized the Fellow,
and took the Camel from him, while the other three
stepped up to me, and my old Pilot; seeing us, as it
were unarmed, for I had no Weapon about me but
my Sword, which couM but ill defend me against three
Horsemen. The first that came up, stopped short upon
my drawing my Sword (for they are errant Cowards);
but a second coming upon my Left, gave me a Blow
on the Head, which I never felt till afterward, and
wondered, when I came to. myself, what was the Mat-
ter with me, and where I was, for he laid me stat on
the Ground; but my ney|rnfailing old Pilot, the Portu-
guese (so Providence unl"6bkf?d-£or directs Deliverances
from Dangers, which to us are unforeseen), had a Pistol
in his Pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the Tar-
tars neither; if they had, I suppose they would" not have
attacked us. But Cowards are always boldest when
there is no Danger.
The old Man, seeing me d&Wn, with & bold Heart
stepped up to the Fellow that had struck me, and, lay-
ing hold of his Arm with one Hand, -and pulling him
down by main Force a little towards him with the
other, he ihot him into the Head, and 1aid him dead on
the Spot; he then immediately stepped up to him who
had stopped us, as I said, a*id before he could coftse
forward again {for it was all dotte" as it were ki a Mo-
ment), made a Blow at him with a Scymitar^ which
he always wore; but, milFmg the Man, cut his Horfe
into the #Side of his Head, cut otae of his Ears off by
the Root, and a great Slice down the Side of his Face.
The poor Beast, enraged with the Wounds, was no more
to be governed by his Rider, though the Fellow fat well
enough too ; but away he flew, and carried him quite
out of the Pilot's Reach, and at some Distance rising
upon his hind Legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell
upon him.
In this Interval the poor Chinese came in, who had
lost the Camel, but he had no Weapon ; however* fee-
ing the Tartar down, and his Horse fallen upon him,
he runs to him, and, seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured
Weapon he had by his Side, something like a Pole-ax,
but not a Pole-ax neither, he wrenched it from him,
and made mist to knock his Tartarian firains Out witli
it. But my old Man had the third Tartar to deal with
still 5 and seeing he did not fly as he expected, nor come
on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stood stock-
still, the old Man stood still too, and falls to work with
his Tackle to charge his Pistol again j but as soon as the
Tartar saw the Pistol, whether he supposed it to be the
same or another, I know not; but away he seoured, and
left my Pilot, my Champion I called him afterwards* a
complete Victory.
By this time I was a little awake; for I thought, when
I first be^gan to awake, that I had been in a sweet Sleep;
but as I said above, I wondered where I was, how-I
came upon the Ground, and what was the Matter 5 in
a* Word, a few Moments after, as Sense returned, I felt
Pain, though I did not know where; I clapped . my
Hand to my Head, and took it away bloody j then I
felt my Head ach; and then/ in another Moment, Me-
G g 2 moiy
mory returned, and every thing was present to me
again.
I jumped up upon my Feet instantly, and got hold of
my Sword, but no Enemies in View. I found a Tar-
tar lie dead, and his Horse standing very quietly by
him and, looking farther, I saw my Champion and
Deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had
.done coming back with his Hanger in his Hand; the
old Man, seeing me on my Feet, came running to me,
and embraced me with a great deal of Joy, being afraid
before, that I had been killed; and seeing me bloody,
would see how I was hurt; but it was not much, only
what we call a broken Head; neither did I afterwards
iind any great Inconvenience from the Blow, other than
the Place which was hurt, and which was well again in
two or three Days.
We made no great Gain however, by this Victory;
for we lost a Camel, and gained a Horse: But that which
was remarkable, when we came back to the Village,
the Man demanded to be paid for the Camel ; I dis-
puted it, and it was brought to a Hearing before the
Chinese Judge of the Place ; that is to fay, in English^
we went before a Justice of the Peace. Give him his
Due, he acted with a great deal of Prudence and Impar-
tiality; and, having heard both Sides, he gravely asked
the Chinese Man that went with me to buy the Camel,
whose Servant he was ? I am no Servant, said he, but
went with the Stranger. At whose Request ? said the
Justice. At the Stranger's Request, said he, Why then,
said the Justice, you were the Stranger's Servant for
the Time; and the Camel being delivered to his
Servant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay
ibr it.
I confess the Thing was so clear, that I had not a
Word to say; but, admiring to see such just Reasoning
. upon the Consequence, and so accurate stating the Cafe,
I paid willingly for the Camel, and sent for another;
bujt ypjrmy observe, I sent for it ; I did not go so fetch
it myself any more; I had enough of that.
The City of Naum is a Frontier of the Chinese Em-
;pirje $ they call it fortified, and so it is, as Fortifications
go there $ for this I will venture to affirm, that all the
* Tartars
Tartars in Karakathay, which, I believe, are some Mil-
lions, could not batter down the Walls with their Bows
and Arrows; but to call it strong, if it were attacked
with Cannon, would be to make those who understand
it, laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, above two Days Journey
of this City, when Messengers were sent Express to
every Part of the Road, to tell all Travellers and Ca-
ravans to halt, tili they had a Guard sent to them ; for
that an unusual Body of Tartars, making ten thousand
in all, had appeared in the Way, about thirty Miles be-
yond the City.
This was very bad News to Travellers; however, it
was carefully done of the Governor, and we were very
glad to hear we Ihould have a Guard. Accordingly
two Days after we had 200 Soldiers sent us from a Gaii-
fon of th2 Chinese, on our Left, and three hundred more
from the City of Naum, and with those we advanced
boldly; the 300 Soldiers and Naum marched in our
Front, the 20c in our Rear, and our Men on each Side
of our Camels with our Baggage, and the whole Ca-
ravan in the Centre; in this Order, and well prepared
for Battle, we thought ourselves a Match for the whole
10,000 Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared; but the
next Day, when they did appear, it was quite another
thing.
It was early in the Morning, when marching from a
little well-situated Town, called CJjangu, we had a Ri-
ver to pass, where we were obliged to ferry; and had
the Tartars had an Intelligence, then had been the Time
to have attacked us, when the Caravan being over,
the Rear-guard was behind; but they did not appear
there.
About three Hours after, when we were entered up-
on a Desert of about fifteen or sixteen Miles over, be-
hold, by a Clouxi of Dust they raised, we saw an Enemy
was at hand; and they were at hand indeed, for they
came on upon the Spur.
The Chinese, our Guard on the Front, who had talk'd
so big the Day before, began to stagger, and the Sol-
diers frequently looked behind them ; which is a certain
gign in a Soldier, that he is just ready to run away. My
old
Old Pilot was of my Mind; and, being near me, he
called out, Seignior Ingle/ey said he, those Fellows must
tie encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if the Tar-
tafs come on, they will never stand it. I am of your
Mind, said I: But what Course must be done? Done!
feid he; let fifty of our Men advance, and flank them
tm each Wing, and encourage them, and they will fight
li&e brave Fellows in brave Company; but without it
they will every Man turn his Back. Immediately I rode
Tap to our Leader, and told him, who was exactly of
Cur Mind ,* and accordingly fifty of us marched to the
Right Wing, and fifty to the Left, and the rest made a
Line of Reserve; for so we marched, leaving the last
ZOO Men to make another Body by themselves, and
to guard the Camels; only that, if need were, they
Should fend an hundred Men to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable
Company they were; how many, we could not tell;
fcut 10,000 we thought was the least. A Party of 'em
tame on first, and viewed our Posture, traversing the
Ground in the Front of our Line; and as we found
them within Gun-shot, our Leader ordered the two
Wings to advance swiftly, and give them a Salvo on
each Wing, with their Shot, which was done; but they
went ofF, and, I suppose, went back to give an Ac-
count of the Reception they were like to meet with;
and, indeed, that Salute clogged their Stomachs; for
they immediately halted, stood a while to consider of
it, and, wheeling off" to the Left, they gave over the
Design, and said no more to us for that time; which was
very agreeable to our Circumstances, which were but
Very indifferent for a Battle with such a Number.
Two Days after this we came to the City Naum, or
Naunm; we thanked the Governor for his Care for us,
and collected to the Value of 100 Crowns, or there-
abouts, which we gave to the Soldiers sent to guard
tis; and here we rested one Day. This is a Garifon
indeed, and there were 900 Soldiers kept here; but
the Reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite Fron-
tiers lay nearer to them than they do now, the Musco-
vites having abandoned that Part of the Country (which
§es from this City West, for about two hundred Miles)
as
as desolate, and unfit for Use; and more especially, be-
ing so very remote, and so difficult to send Troops thi-
ther for its Defence; for we had yet above two thousand
Miles to Muscovy, properly so called.
After this we passed several great Rivers, and twu'
dreadful Deserts, one of which we were sixteen Days pair-
ing over, and which, as I said, was to be called No Marts
Land; and on the 13 th of April we came to the Fron-
tiers of the Muscovite Dominions. I think the first City,
or Town, or Fortress, whatever it might be called, that
belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Argun^ be- 1
ing on the West-fide of the River Argun..
I could not hut difcover an infinite Satisfaction, that f
was now arrived in, as 1 called it, a Christian Country;
or, at least, in a Country governed by Christians; for-
though the Muscovites do, in my Opinion, but just deserve-
the Name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be*
and are very devout in their Way. It would certainljp
occur to any Man who travels the World as I have
done, and who had any Power of Reflection; I fay, k
would occur to him, to reflect what a Blessing it is to-
be brought into the World where the Name of God,
and of a Redeemer, is known, worshipped and adored,
and not where the People, given up by Heaven t<*
strong Delusions, worship the Devil, and prostrate them-
selves to Stocks and Stones; worship Monsters, Ele-
ments, horrible-shaped Animals, and Statues, or Images
of Monsters. Not a Town or City we passM through,
but had their JPagods, their Idols, and their Temples,
and ignorant People worshipping even the Works of their
own Hands.
Now we came where, at least, a Face of the Christian
Worship appeared, where the Knee was bowed to Je-
sus; and whether ighorantly or not, yet the ChiifHaBr
Religion was owned, and the Name of the True God
was called upon, and adored; and it made the very
Recesses of my Soul rejoice to fee it. I saluted the brave
Scots Merchant I mentioned above, with my first Ac-
knowlegement of this; and, taking him by the Hand,
I said to him, Blessed be God, we are once again come
among Christians. He smiled, and answered, Do not
xejoice too soon, Countryman; these Mx/cov*tes are
5 but
but an odd Sort of Christians; and but for the Name op
it, you may fee very little of the Substance for some
Months farther of our Journey.
Wei!, said I, but still 'tis better than Paganism, and
worshipping of Devils. Why, Til tell you, said he;
except the Ruffian Soldiers in Garisons, and a few of the
Inhabitants of the Cities upon the Road, all the rest of
this Country, for above a thousand Miles farther, is in-
liabited by the worst and most ignorant of Pagans; and
fo indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest Piece of
solid Earth, if I understand any thing of the Surface of
the Globe, that is to be found in any Part of the
World ; we have at least twelve hundred Miles to the
Sea, Eastward ; we had at least two thousand to the
Bottom of the Baltic Sea, Westward; and almost three
thousand Miles, if we left that Sea, and went on West to
the British and French Channels; we had full five thou-
sand Miles to the Indian or Persian Sea, South; and
about eight hundred Miles to the Frozen Sea, North:
Nay, if iome People may be believed, there might be
no Sea. North-east, till we came round the Pole, and
consequently into the North-west, and fo had a Conti-
nent of Land into America, no Mortal knows where;
though I could give some Reasons why I believe that to
be a Mistake too.
As we entered into the Muscovite Dominions, a good
while before we came to any considerable Town, we
had nothing to observe there but this; firs):, that all the
jRivers run to the East. As I understood by the Charts
which Tome of our Caravans had with them, - it was
plain, that all those Rivers ran into the great River
Vamoury or Gammour. This River, by the natural
Course of it, must run into the East Sea, or Chinese
Ocean. The Story they tell us, that the Mouth of this
River is choked up with Bulrushes of a monstrous
Growth, <viz. three Foot about, and twenty or thirty
Foot high, I must be allowed to /ay, I believe nothing .
of; but as its Navigation is of no Use, because there
is no Trade that Way, the Tartars, to whom alone it
belongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle, so nobody
that ever I heard of, has been curious enough, either to
6°
go dovvn to the Mouth os it in Boats, or come up froin
the Mouth of it in Ships; but this is certain, that this
River running due East, in the Latitude of 60 Degrees,
carries a vast Concourse of Rivers along with it, and
finds an Ocean to empty itself in that Latitude; so we
are sure of Sea there.
Some Leagues to the North of this River there are
several considerable Rivers, whose Streams run as due
North as the Yaœour runs East; and these are all found
to join their Waters with the great River Tartarus
named so from the northermost Nations of the Mo-
gul Tartars, who, the Chinese fay, were the first Tar-
tars in the World; and who, as our Geographers alledge,
are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred Story.
These Rivers running all Northward, as well as all
the other Rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evi-
dent, that the Northern Ocean bounds the Land also
on that Side; so that it does not seem rational in the
least to think, that the Land can extend itself to join
with America on that Side, or that there is not a Com-
munication between the Northern and the Eastern
Ocean; but of this I shall say no more; it was my Ob-
servation at that Time, and therefore I take Notice of
it in this Place. We now advanced from the River Ar-
guna by easy and moderate Journeys, and were very
visibly obliged to the Care the Czar of Mufccroy has
taken, to have Cities and Towns built in as many Places
as are possible to place them, where his Soldiers keep
Garison something like the Stationary Soldiers placed
by the Romans in the remotest Countries of their Em-
pire, some of which I had read were particularly placed
in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and for the
Lodging of Travellers; and thus it was here; for where-
ever we came, though at these Towns and Stations,
the Garisons and Governor were Ruffians, and profefs'd
mere Pagans, sacrificing to Idols, and worshipping the
Sun, Moon, and Stars, or all the Host of Heaven; and
not only so, but were of all the Heathens and Pagans
that ever I met with, the most barbarous, except only
that they did not eat Man's Flelh, as our Savages of
America did.
Vol. II. N°. 23. H h
Some
Some Instances of this we met with in the Country
between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite Domi-
nions, and a City of Tartars and Ruffians together,
called "Norttdnjkay; in which Space is a continued De-
fart or Forest, which cost us twenty Days to travel over
it. In a Village near the last of those Places I had the
Curiosity to go and fee their way of Living, which is
moil brutish and unfufferable; they had, I suppose, a
great Sacrifice that Day; for there stood out upon an
old Stump of a Tree, an Idol made of Wood, fright-
ful as the Devil; at least as any thing we can think of
to represent the Devil, can be made; it had an Head
certainly not so much as resembling any Creature that
the World ever saw; Ears as big as Goats Horns, and
as high; Eyes as big as a Crown Piece; a Nose like a
crooked Ram's Horn, and a Mouth extended four-cor-
ner'd, like that of a Lion,, with horrible Teeth, hook'd
like a Parrot's undcr-Bili; it was dressed up in the
filthiest Manner that you can suppose ; -its upper Gar-
ment was of Sheep-skins, with the Wool outward; a
great Tartar Bonnet on the Head, with two Horns
growing" through it; it was about eight Foot high,
yet had no Feet or Legs, or any other Proportion of
Parts.
This Scarecrow was set up at the Out-fide of the
Village; and when I came near to it, there were fix-
teen or seventeen Creatures, whether Men or Women,
I could not tell, for they make no Distinction by their
Habits, either of Body or Head these lay all flat on the
Ground, round this formidable Block of Jhapelels Wood.
I saw no Motion among them any more than if they
had been Logs of Wood like their Idol; at first I really
thought they had been so; but when I came a little
nearer, they started up upon their Feet; and raised an
howling Cry, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed
Hounds, and walked away as if they were displeased at
our disturbing them. A little way off from this Mon-
ster, and at the Door of a Tent or LI ut, made all of
Sheep-lkins and Cow-skins, dry'd, stood three Butch-
ers: I thought they were such; for when I came nearer
to them, I found they had long Knives in their Hands,
and in the Middle of the Tent appeared three Sheep kill'd,
and one young Bullock, or Steer. These, it seemsr.wetfe
Sacrifices to that senseless Log of an Idol; and these
three Men, Priests belonging to it; and the Seventeen,
prostrated Wretches were the People who brought the
Offering, and were making their Prayers to that Stock.
I confess I was more moved at their Stupidity, and
this brutish Worship of an Hobgoblin, than ever I wsts
at any thing in my Life; to fee God's most glorious
and best Creature, to whom he had granted so many
Advantages, even by Creation, above the rest of the
Works of his Hands, vested with a reasonable Soul, and
that Soul adorned with Faculties and Capacities adapted
both to honour his Maker, and be honoured by him;
I fay, to fee it funk and degenerated to a Degree so
more thari stupid, as to prostrate itself to a frightful
Nothing, a mere imaginary Object, dressed up by
themselves, and made terrible to themselves by their
own Contrivance, adorned only with Clouts and Rags;
and that this should be the Effect of mere Ignorance,
wrought up into hellish Devotion by the Devil him-
self; who, envying, to his Maker, the Homage and
Adoration of his Creatures, had deluded them mto such
cfrofs surfeiting, sordid, and brutiih Things, as one
would think ihould mock Nature itself
But what signified all the Astonishment and Reflection
of Thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it before my
Eyes ; and there was no room to wonder at it, or think
it impossible; all my Admiration turned to Rage; and
I rode up to the linage or Mcmiler, call it what you
wdl, ana with my Sword cut the Bonnet that was on
its Head in two, iu the Middle, so that it hung down
by one of the Horns; and one of our Men that was
with me took hold of the Sheep-skin that covered it,
and puiled at it, when, behold, a most hideous Outcry
and Howling ran through the Village, and two or three
hundred People came about my Ears, so that I was
glad to ib-u.- f»r it; for we saw some had Bows and
Arrows; but I resolved from that Moment to visit them
a;, a in.

H h z having
having been lamed and jaded with the Badness of the
Way, and our long March over the last Desert; so we
had some Leisure here to put my Design in Execution,
I communicated my Project to the Scots Merchant of
Mo/cow, of whose Courage I had had sufficient Testi-
mony, as above. I told him what I had seen, and
with what Indignation I had since thought, that human
Nature could be so degenerate. I told him, I was re-
solved, if I could get but four or five Men well arm'd,
to go with me, to go and destroy that vile, abomi-
nable Idol; to let them see, that it had no Power to
help itself, and consequently could not be an Object of
Worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them that
offered Sacrifices to it.
He laughed at me: Said he, Your Zeal may be good;
but what do you propose to yourself by it? Propose!
said I; to vindicate the Honour of God, which is in-
sulted by this Devil-Worship. But how will it vindi-
cate the Honour of God? said he, while the People
will not be able to know what you mean by it, un-
less you could speak to them too, and tell them so;
and then they will fight you too, Til assure you; for
they are desperate Fellows, and that especially in De-
fence os their Idolatry. Can we not, said I, do it in
the Night, and then leave them the Reasons in Write-
ing, in their own Language? Writing! said he, why
there is not in five Nations of them, one Man that
knows any thing of a Letter, or how to read a Word
in any Language, or in their own. Wretched Igno-
rance! said I to him; however, I have a great mind
to do it perhaps Nature may draw Inferences from
it to them, to let them fee how brutish they are, to
worship such horrid Things. Look you, Sir, said he,
if your Zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you must
do it; but, in trie next place, I would have you consi-
der, these wild Nations of People are subjected, by
Force, to the Czar of Mu(co<vy\ Dominions; and if you
do this, 'tis ten to one but they will come by Thou-
sands to the Governor of Nertz.injkay> and complain,
and demand Satisfaction; and if he cannot give them
Satisfaction, 'tis ten to one but they revolt; and it will
occasion
•ccasion a new War with all the Tartars in the Coun-
try.
This, I confess, put new Thoughts into my Head -
for awhile but I harped upon the fame String still; -
and all that Day I was uneasy to put my Project in
Execution. Towards the Evening the Scots Merchant
met me by Accident in our Walk about the Town,
and desired to speak with me: I believe, said he, I
have put you off of your good Design; I have been a
little concerned about it since; for I abhor the Idol and
Idolatry, as much as you can do. Truly, said I, you
have put it off a little as to the Execution of it, but
you have not put it all out of my Thoughts; and, I
believe, I shall do it still before I quit this Place, tho'
I were to be delivered up to them for Satisfaction. No,
no, said he; God forbid they mould deliver you up to
such a Crew of Monsters! they lhall not do that neir
ther } that would be murdering you indeed. Why,
said I, how would they use me? Use you! said he; 111
tell you how they served a poor Ruffian, who affronted
them in their Worship just as you did, and whom they
took Prisoner; after they had lamed him with an Ar-
row, that he could not run away, they took him, and
stripped him stark-naked, and set him upon the Top
of the Idol-Monster, and stood all round him, and shot
as many Arrows into him as would stick over his
whole Body; and then they burnt him, and all the
Arrows sticking in him, as a Sacrifice to the Idol.
And was this the fame Idol? said I. Yes, said he, the
very same. Well, said I, Til tell you a Story: So I re-
lated the Story or our Men at Madagascar, and how they
burnt and sack d the Village there, and killed Man, Wo-
man, and Child, for their murdering one of our Men,
just as it i:^ related before; and when I had done, I
added, that I thought we ought to do so to' this Vil-
lage.
He listened very attentively to the Story; but when
I talked of doing so to that Village; said he, You mis-
take very much; it was not this Village, it was almost
a hundred Miles from this Place; but it was the fame
Idol; for they carry him about in Procession all over
the Country. Well, said J, then that Idol ought to be
puniihed
jpaiiithed fork; and it shall, said I, if I live this Night
out.
In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the Design,
and told me I should not go alone, but he would go
-with me; but he would go first, and bring a stout Fel-
low, one of his Countrymen, to go also with us; and
one, said he, as famous for his Zeal as you can'desire
any one to be, against such devilish Things as these.
In a word, he brought me bis Comrade, a Scotsman,
whom he called Captain Richardson; and I gave him a
full Account of what I had seen, and also of what I in-
tended; and he told me, readily he would go with
me, if it cost him his Life. So we agreed to go, only
we throe. I had, indeed, proposed it to my Partner;
but he declined it. He said, He was ready to assist me
to the utmost, and upon all Occasions, for my Defence;
but that ,this was an Adventure quite out of his Way:
So, I fay, we resolved upon our Work, only we three,
and my Man-servant, and to put it in Execution that
Night about Midnight, with all the Secrecy imagin-
able.
However, upon second Thoughts, we were willing
to delay it till the next Night, because the Caravan be-
ing to set forward in the Morning, we supposed the
Governor could not pretend to give them any Satis-
faction upon us when we were out of his Power; the
Scots Merchant, as steady in his Resolution to enter -
prize it, as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar s
Robe or Gown of Sheep-flans, and a Bonnet, with a
Bow and Arrows, and had provided the fame for himself
and- his Countryman, that the People, if they saw us,
should not be able to determine who we were.
All the first Night we spent in mixing up some com-
bustible Matter with Jqua <vitœ, Gunpowder, and such
other Materials as we could oet; and, having a good
Quantity of Tar in a little Pot, about an Hour after
Night we set out upon our Expedition.
We came to the Place about eleven o'Clock at Night,
and found that the People had not the least jealousy of
Danger attending their Idol; the Night Was cloudy;
yet the Moon gave us Light enough to fee, that the
Idol stood iust in the fame Posture and Place that it
J ~ AU
did before. The People seemed to be #11 at their Rest;
only, that in the great Hut, or Tent, as: we called it,
where we saw the three Priests, whom we mistook for
Butchers ; we saw a Light, and, going up close to the
Door, we heard People talking, as if there were five
or six of them; we concluded therefore, that if we
set Wildfire to the Idol, these Men would come out
immediately, and run up to the Place to rescue it from
the Destruction that we intended for it; and what to*
do with them we knew not. Once we thought of
carrying it away, and setting Fire to it at a Distance';
but when we came to handle it, we found it too bulky
for our Carriage; so we were at a Loss again. The
second Scotsman was for setting Fire to the Tent,' or
Hut, and knocking the Createres that were there on
#the Head, when they came out; but I could not join
with that; I was against killing them, if it was possible
to be avoided. Well then, said the Scots Merchant, PII
tell you what we will do; we will try to take 'em Pri-
soners, tie their Hands, and make them stand and fee
their Idol destroyed.
As it happened, we had Twine or Packthread enough
about us, which we used to tie our Fire-works toge-
ther with; so we resolved to attack these People first,
and with as little Noise as we could. The first Thing
we did, we knocked at the Door: when one of the;
Priests coming to the Door, we immediately seized up-
on him, stopped his Mouth, and ty'd his Hands behind
him, and led him to the Idol, where we gagg'd him,
that he might not make a Noise j tied his Feet also to-
gether, and left him on the Ground.
Two of us then waited at the Door, expecting- that-
another would come out to see what the Matter was;
but we waited so long till the third Man came back to
us; and then, nobody coming out, we knocked again
gently, and immediately out came two more, and we
served them just in the same manner, but were oblig'd1
to go all with them, and lay them down by the Idol
some Distance from one another; when, going back,-
we found two more were come out to the Door, aud
a third stood behind them witfiin the * Door. We-
seized the two, and immediately tied them, when the
third
third stepping back, and crying out, my Scots Merchant
went in after him, and taking out a Composition we
had made, that would only smoke and stink, he set
Fire to it, and threw it in among them; by that time
the other Scotsman, and my Man taking Charge of the
two Men already bound, and tied together also by the
Arm, led them away to the Idol, and left them there,
to see if their Idol would relieve them, making haste
back to us.
When the Fuze we had thrown in had filled the Hut
with .so much Smoke, that they were almost suffocated, .
we then threw in a small Leather Bag of another kind,
which flamed like a Candle, and, following it in, we
found there were but four People left, who, it seems,
were two Men and two Women, and, as we supposed,
had been about some of their diabolic Sacrifices. They *
appeared, in ihort, frighted to Death, at least so as to
sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak neither,
for the Smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had
the other, and all without any Noise. I ihould have
said, we brought them out of the House, or Hut, first;
for, indeed, we were not able to bear the Smoke any
more than they were. When we had done thi?, we
carried them all together to the Idol; when we came
there we fell to work with him; and first we daubed
him all over, and his Robes also, with Tar, and such
other Stuff as we had, which was Tallow mixed with
Brimstone; then we stopped his Eyes, and Ears, and
Mouth full of Gunpowder; then we wrapped up a
great Piece of Wilds!re in his Bonnet; and then stick-
ing all the Combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, we looked about to fee if we could find any thing
else to help to burn him; when my Scotsman remem-
bred, that by the Tent, or Hut, where the Men were,
there lay a Heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Rushes
I do not remember; away he and the other Scotsman
ran, and fetched their Arms full of that. When we
had done this, we took all our Prisoners, and brought
them, having united their Feet, and ungag'd their
Mouths, and made them stand up, and set them just
before
before their monstrous Idol, and then set Fire to the
Whole.
We staid by it a Quarter os an Hour, or thereabouts,
till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, and Ears of the:
Idol blew up, and, as we could perceive, had split and
deformed the Shape of it; and, in a word, till we saw"
it burn into a mere Block or Log of Wood; and then
setting the dry Forage to it, we found it would be soon
quite consumed, so we began to think of going away;
but the Scotsman said, No, we must not go; for these
poor deluded Wretches will all throw themselves inta
the Fire, and burn themselves with the Idol; so we re-
solved to stay till the Forage was burnt down too, and
then we came away, and left them.
In the Morning we appeared among our Fellow
Travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for out
Journey; nor could any Man suggest, that we had been
any-where but in our Beds, as Travellers might be sup-
posed to be, to fit themselves for the Fatigues of that
Day's Journey.
But it did not end so; for the next Day came a great
Multitude of the Country-people, not only of this
Village, but of a hundred more, for aught I know, to
the Town-Gates; and, in a most outrageous Manner,
demanded Satisfaction of the Ruffian Governor, for the
insulting their Priests, and burning their Great Cham-
Cbi-TbaungUy such an hard Name they gave the mon-
strous Creature they worshipped; the People of Nert-
xinjkay were at first in a great Consternation; for, they
said, the Tartars were no less than thirty thousand, and
that in a few Days more, they would be one hundred
thousand strong»
The Ruffian Governor sent out Messengers to appease"
them and gave them all the good Words imaginable.
He assured them he knew nothing of it, and that there
had not a Soul of his Garifon been abroad; that it
could not be from any-body there; and if they would
let him know who it was, they mould be exemplarily
punished. They returned, haughtily, That all the Coun-
try reverenced the Great Cbam-Cbi-Tbawgii, who
dwelt in the Sun, and "no Mortal would have dccr^i
to offer Violence to his Image, but some Christian-Mis-
Vol, It I i crcant?
cfeant; so they called them, it seems ; and they there^
fore denounced War against him, and all the Ruffians?
who, they said, were Miscreants aud Christians.
The Governor, still patient, and unwilling to make
a Breach, or to have any Cause of War alledged to be
given by him, the Czar having streightly charged him
to treat the conquered Country with Gentleness 'and Ci-
vility, gave them still all the good Words he could; at
last he told them, there was a Caravan gone towards
Russia that Morning, and, perhaps, it was some os themr
who had done 'em this Injury; and that, if they would
be satisfied with that, he would fend after them, to in-
quire into it. This seemed to appease them a little;
and accordingly the Governor sent after us, and gave us
a particular Account how the Thing was; intimating
withal, that if any in our Caravan had done it, they
should make their Escape; but that, whether they had
done it, or no, we mould make all the Haste forward
that was possible; and that, in the mean time, he would
keep them in play as long as he could.
This was very friendly in the Governor. How-
ever, when it came to the Caravan, there was nobody
knew any thing of the Matter; and, as for us that were
guilty, we were the least of all suspected; none so
much as asked us the Question j however, the Captain
of the Caravan, for the Time, took the Hint that the
Governor gave us, and we marched or travelled two
Days and two Nights without any considerable Stop,
and then we lay at a Village called Plothus; nor did we
make any long Stop here, but hastened on towards
"Jaranxcna, another of the Czar of Muscovy s Colonies,
and where we expected we should be safe; but it ia-
to be observed, that here we began, for two or three
Days March, to enter upon a vast nameless Desert, of
which I mall fay more in its Place; and which if we
had now been upon it, 'tis more than 'probable, we
had been all destroyed. It was the second Day's March
from Plothus, that, by the Clouds of Dust behind us at
a great Distance, some of our People began to be sen-
sible we were pursued; we had entered the Desert, and
had pass'd by a great Lake, called Schanh Ofcr9 when
we perceived a very great Body of Horse appear on
2 the
die other Side of the Lake to the North, we travelling
West. We observed they went away West, as we did;
•but had supposed we should have taken that Side os
the Lake, whereas we very happily took the South
Side; and in two Days more we saw them not, for they,
believing we were still before them, pushed on, till they
came to the River Udda; this is a very great River
when it passes farther North; but where we came to it,
we found it narrow and ford able.
The third Day they either found their Mistake, or
had Intelligence of -us, and came pouring in upon us,
towards the Dusk of the Evening. We had, to our
great Satisfaction, just pitched upon a Place for our
Camp, which was very convenient for the Night; for
as we were upon a Desert, though but at the Begin-
ning of it, that was above five hundred Miles over, we
had no Towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none
.but the City Jara^ena^ which we had yet two Days
March to; the Desert, however, had some few Woods
in it on this Side, and little Rivers, which ran all into
-the great River Vdda, It was in a narrow Streight be-
tween two small, but very thick Woods, that we pitched
our little Camp for that Night, expecting to be attacked
in the Night.
Nobody knew but ourselves, what we were pursues •
for; but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go
about in Troops in that Desert, so the Caravans always
fortify themselves every Night against them, as against
^Armies of Robbers j and it was therefore no new Thing
to be pursued.
But we had this Night, of all the Nights of our
Travels, a most advantageous Camp; for we lay be-
tween two Woods, with a little Rivulet running just
before our Front; so that we could not be surrounded
or attacked any way, but in our Front ;Or Rear; we
took care also to make our Front as strong as we could,
by placing our Packs, with our Camels and Horses, all
in a Line on the Inside o.f the River, and we felPd
some Trees in our Rear.
In this Posture we encamped -for the Night \ but the
Enemy was upon us before we had finished our Situa-
tion: They did not come on us like Thieves, as we
I i 2 expected ^
^xpected; but sent three Messengers to us, to demantj
%e Men to be delivered to them, that had abused their
Priests, and burnt their God Cbam-Cbi-Tbaungu> that
they might burn them with Fire; and, upon this, they
said, they would go away, and do us no further Harm,
^Otherwise they would burn us all with Fire. Our
Men looked very blank at this Message, and began
to stare at one another, to fee who looked with
niost Guilt in their Faces; but, nobody was the Word,
nobody did it. The Leader of the Caravan sent Word,
he was well assured it was not done by any of our
Camp ; that we were peaceable Merchants travelling on
our Business; that we had done no Harm to them, or
to any one else; and therefore they mult look farther
for their Enemies, who had injured them, for we were
not the People; so desired them not to disturb us; for
if they did, we mould defend ourselves.
They were far from being fatisfy'd with this for an
Answer, and a great Croud of them came down in
the Morning, by Break of Day, to our Camp; but,
seeing us ni such an advantageous Situation, they durst
come no farther than the Brook in our Front, where
they stood, and shewed us such a Number, as, indeed,
terrified us very much; for those that spoKe least of
them, spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood, and
: looked at us a while, and then setting up a great Howl,
they let fly a Cloud of Arrows among us; but we were
well enough fortified for that, for we sheltered under
our Baggage; and I do not remember that one Man of
us was hurt.
Some time after this, we saw them move a little to
our Right, and expected them on the Rear, when a
cunning Fellcw, a CoJJack, ar, they call them, of Jara-
woena, "jn the Pay of the Muscovites, calling to the
Leader of the Caravan, said to him, Til go send all these
People away to Sibeilka; this was a City four or five
T)ays JourneV, at least, to the South, and rather behind
us. So he takes his Bow and Arrows, and, getting
on Horseback, he rides away from our Rear directly,
as it v.ere, back to NcrtzztrJ&ay; after this, he takes a
great Circuit about, and comes to the Army of the
Tartars, as if he had been sent Express to tell them
a long*
& long Story, that the People who-had burnt their Cham-
Cbi-Tbau?iguy were gone to Sibeilka, with a Caravan of"
Miscreants,' as he called them; that is to fay, Chri-
stians; and that they were resolved to burn the God
'Scbal-Isar-, belonging to the Tonguses. _ r
As this Fellow was a mere Tartar > and perfectly
spoke their Language; he counterfeited so well, that
they all took it from him, and away they drove, in a
moil violent Hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems, vya$
five Days Journey to the South, and in less than three
Hours they were intirely out of our Sight, and we ne-
ver heard any more of them, nor ever knew whether
they went to that other Place called Sibeilka, or no.
So we pafs'd safely on to the City of Jaranxcna,
where there was a Garison of Muscovites; and there
we relied five Days, the Caravan being exceedingly fa-
tigued with the last Day's March, and with want of
Rest in the Night.
From this Ci~y we had a frightful Desert, which
held us three-and-twtnty Days March. We furniGied
ourselves with some Tents here, for the better accom-
modating ouiilhcs in the Night; and the Leader of
the Ln:avan procured sixteen Carriages, or Waggons,
of the Country, for carrying our Water and Provisions;
and these Can lages were our Defence every N>ht round
our little Camp ; so that had the Tartars appeared, un-
less t\ty had been very numerous indeed, they would
not have been able to hurt us.
We may well be supposed to want Rest again after
this long Journeyfor in this Desert we saw neither
House or Tree, or scarce a Bulh ; we saw, indeed, abun-
dance os the Sable-hunters, as they called them; theje
are all Tartars of the 71%;// Ta,-taryy of which this
Country is a fart; and they frequently attack small
Caravans; but we saw no Numbers of them together.
I was curious to fee the Sable-skins they catched""^ but
I could never speak with any of them; for they durst
not come near us, neither durst we straggle from our
Company, to go near then?.
After we had pafs'd this Desert, we came into a
Country pretty well inhabited; that is to fay, we
found Towns and Castles settled by the Czar of Mss.
covy, with Garisons of Stationary Soldiers to protect
the Caravans, and defend the Country against the Tar-
tars, who would otherwise make it very dangerous
travelling; and his Czarisli Majesty has given such strict
Orders for the well guarding the Caravans and Mer-
chants, that if there are any Tartars heard of in the
Country, Detachments of the Garrison are always sent
to see Travellers safe from Station to Station.
And thus the Governor of Adinjkoy, whom I had
Opportunity to make a Visit to, by means of the Scots
Merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered us
a Guard of 50 Men, if we thought there was any
Danger, to the next Station.
J thought long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe, we should find the Country better peopled,
and the People more civilized; but I found myself
mistaken in both, for we had yet the Nation of the
Tonguefes to pass through; where we saw the fame
Tokens of Paganism and Barbarity, or worse, than be-
fore; only as they were conquered by the Muscovites,
and intirely reduced, they were not so dangerous ; but,
for Rudeness of Manners, Idolatry, and Polytheism,
110 People in the World ever went beypnd them. They
are cloathed all in Skins of Beasts, and tjieir Houses are
built of the fame. You know not a Man from a Wo-
man, neither by the Ruggednefs of their Countenances,
or their Cloaths; and in the Winter, when the Ground
is cover'd with Snow, they live under Ground in Houses
like Vaults, which have Cavities or Caves going from
one to another.
If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thawign for a
whole Village,, or Country, these had Idols in every
Hut, and every Cave; besides, they worship the Stars,
the Sun, the Water, the Snow ; and, in a word, every
thing that they do not understand, and they understand
but very little; so that almost every Element, every
uncommon thing, sets them a sacrificing.
But I am no more to describe People than Countries,
any farther than my own Story comes to be concerns
in them. I met with nothing peculiar to myself in
all this Country, which, I reckon, was from the De-
sert, which I spoke of last, at least, 400 Miles, half of
'it
it being another Desert, whicfi took, us up twelve Days
severe Travelling, without House, Tree, or Bush; but
were obliged again to carry our own Provisions, as well
Water as Bread. After we were out of this Desert,
and had travelled two Days, we came to Janezay, a
Muscovite City or Station, on the great River Janexay.
This River, they told us, parted Europe from Jsia, tho*
©ur Map-makers, as I am told, do not agree to it 5
however, it ia certainly the Eastern Boundary of the
antient Siberia, which now makes a Province only of
the vast Muscovite Empire, but is itself equal in Bignes*
to the whole Empire of Germany.
And yet here I observed Ignorance and Paganism
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite Garisons; all the
Country between the River Ohy and the River Jatiezay
is as intirely Pagan, and the People, as barbarous, as
the remotest of the 'Tartars, nay, as any Nation for
aught I know in djia or Jmerica. I also found, which
I observed to the Muscovite Governors, whom I had
Opportunity to converse with, that the Pagans are not
much the wiser, or the nearer Christianity, for being
under the Muscovite Government; which they acknow-
ledged was true enough, but, they said, it was none of
their Business: That if the Czar expected to convert
his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar Subjects, it should
be done by fending Clergymen among them, not Soldi-
ers; and they added, with more Sincerity than I ex*
pected, that they found it was not so much the Con-
cern of their Monarch to make the People Christians,
as it was to make them Subjects,
From this River td the great River Oby, we crossed
a wild uncultivated Country; I cannot fay 'tis' a bar-
barous Soil; 'tis only barren of People, and good Ma-
nagement; otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant,
fruitful, and agreeable Country. What Inhabitants we
found in it are all Pagans, except such as are sent
among them from Russia j for this is the Country I
mean on both Sides the River Oby, whither the Mus-
covite Criminals, that are not put to Death, are ba-
mmed, and from whence it is next to impossible 5the)r
should ever come away.
I have
I have nothing material to say of my particular Af-
fairs, till I came to Toboljki, the Capital City of Siberia^
where J continued some time on the following Occa-
sion.
We had been now almost seven Months on our
Journey, and Winter began to come on apace; where-
upon my Partner and I called a Council about our par-
ticular Affairs, in which we found it proper, consider-
ing that we were bound for England, and not for Mos-
cow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They
told us of Sledges and Rein-Deer to carry us over the
Snow in the Winter-time; and, indeed, they have such
Things, as it would be incredible to relate the Par-
ticulars of, by which means the Ruffians travel more
in the Winter than they can in Summer; because in
these Sledges they are able to run Night and Day; the
Snow being frozen, is one universal Covering to Na-
ture, by which the Hills, the Vales, the Rivers, the
Lakes, are all smooth, and hard as a Stone; and they
run upon the Surface, without any Regard to what is
underneath.
But I had no Occasion to push at a Winter Journey of
this kind; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and
my Route lay two Ways; either I must go on as the
Caravan went, till I came to Jcrosiow, and then go ofF
West for Narva* and the Gulph of Finland, and so either
hy Sea or Land to Dantz.Uk, where I might possibly sell
my China Cargo to good Advantage, or I mult leave
the Caravan at a little Town on the Dwiua, from
whence I had but six Days by Water to Arch-Angela
and from thence might be sure of Shipping, cither to
England, Holland, or Hamlwgh.
Now to go any of these Journeys in the Winter,
would have been preposterous; for as to Dantzick, the
Baltic would be frozen up, and 1 could not get Pas-
sage; and to go by Land in those Countries, was far
lei's safe than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise to
Arch-Angel in OSlober, all the Ships would be gone
from thence, and even the Merchants, who dwell there
in Summer, retire South t/> Moscow in the Winter,
when the Ships are gone j so that I mould have no-
thing but Extremity of Cold to encounter, with a Scar-
city of Provisions, and must lie there in an empty Town
all the Winter: So that, upon the whole, I thought it
much my better Way to let the Caravan go, and to
make Provision to winter where I was, <viz. at Toboljki
in Siberia, in the Latitude of sixty Degrees, where I
was sure of three Things to wear out a cold Winter
with, «ws. Plenty of Provision, such as the Country af-
forded, a warm House, with Fuel enough, and excellent
Company; of all which I shall give a full Account in
its Place.
I was now in a quite different Climate from my
beloved Island, where I never felt Cold, except when
I had my Ague; on the contrary, I had much to do
to bear my Cloaths on my Back, and never made any
Fire but without Doors, and for my Necessity, in dres-
sing my Food, £sV. Now I made me three good Vests,
with large Robes or Gowns over them to hang down
to the Feet, and button close to the Wrists, and all
these lined with Furs, to make them sufficiently
warm.
As to a warm House, I must confess, I greatly dis-
like our Way in England, of making Fires in every
Room in the House, in open Chimneys, which, when
the Fire was out, always kept the Air in the Room
cold as the Climate. But taking an Apartment in a
good House in the Town, I ordered a Chimney to be
built like a Furnace, in the Centre of six several Rooms,
like a Stove, the Funnel to carry the Smoke went up
one Way, the Door to come at the Fire went in an-
other, and all the Rooms were kept equally warm,
but no Fire seen; like as they heat the Bagnios in
Evgland.
By this Means we had always the fame Climate in all
the Rooms, and an equal Heat was preserved; and how
cold soever it was without, it was always warm within;
and yet we saw no Fire, nor were ever incommoded
with any Smoke.
The most wonderful Thing of all was, that it Ihould*
be possible to meet with good Company here, in a
Country so barbarous as that of the most Northerly
K k Pam
Vol. II.
Parts of Europe, near the frozen Ocean, and within but
a very few Degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the Country where the State Criminals
of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished; this
City was full of Noblemen, Princes, Gentlemen, Colonels,
and, in short, all Degrees of the Nobility, Gentry, Sol-
diery, and Courtiers of Muscovy. Here were the fa-
mous Prince Galilfkcn, or Galojsken, and his Son, the old
General Robofiijky^ and several other Persons of Note, and
some Ladies.
By means of my Scots Merchant, whom, neverthe-
less, I parted with here, I made an Acquaintance with
several of these Gentlemen, and some of them of the
first Rank; and from these, in the long Winter-nights
in which I staid here, I received several agreeable Vi-
sits. It was talking one Night with a certain Prince,
one of the banished Ministers of State belonging to the
Czar of Muscovy, that my Talk of my particular Cafe
began. He had been telling me abundance of fine
Things, of the Greatness, the Magnificence, and Do-
minions, and the absolute Power of the Emperor of
the Ruffians. I interrupted him, and told him, I was
a greater and more powerful Prince than ever the Czar
of Muscovy was, though my Dominions were not so large,
or my People so many. The Rvsstan Grandee looked a
little surprized, and, fixing his Eyes steadily upon me,
began to wonder what I meant.
I told him, His Wonder would cease when I had ex-
plained myself. First, I told him, I had the absolute
Disposal of the Lives and Fortunes of all my Subjects:
That notwithstanding my absolute Power, I had not
one Person disaffected to my Government, or to my
Person, in all my Dominions. He shook his Head
at that, and said, There, indeed, I outdid the Czar of
Muscovy. I told him, That all the Lands in my King-
dom were my own, and all my Subjects were not only
my Tenants, but Tenants at Will: That they would
all fight for me to the last Drop; and that never Ty-
rant, for such I acknowleded myself to be, was ever so
universally beloved, and yet so horribly feared, by his
Subjects.
5
After
After amusing them with these Riddles in Govern-
ment for a while, I opened the Cafe, and told them
the Story at large of my living in the Island, and how
I managed both myself and the People there that were
under me, just as I have since minuted it down. They
were exceedingly taken with the Story, and especially
the Prince, who told me with a Sigh, that the true
Greatness of Life was to be Master of ourselves; that
he would not have exchanged such a State of Life as
mine, to have been Czar of Muscovy; and that he found
more Fdlclty in the Retirement he seemed to be •ba-
nished to there, than ever he found in the highest Au-
thority he enjoyed in the Court of his Master the Czar:
That the Height of human Wisdom was to bring our
Tempers down to our Circumstances, and to make a
Calm within, under the Weight of the greatest Storm
without. When he came first hither, he said, he used
to tear the Hair from his Head, and the Cloaths from
his Back, as others had done before him; but a little
Time and Consideration had made him look into him-
self, as well as round himself, to Things without t *
That he found the Mind of Man, if it was but once
brought to reflect upon the State of universal Life, and
how little this World was concerned in its true Feli-
city, was perfectly capable of making a Felicity for
itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own
best Ends and Desires, with but very little Assistance
from the World. That Air to breathe in, Food to
sustain Life, Cloaths for Warmth, and Liberty for Exer-
cise, in order to Health, completed in his Opinion, all
that the World could do for us; and though the Great-
ness, the Authority, the Riches, and the Pleasures,
which some enjoyed in the World, and which he had
enjoyed his Share of, had much in them that was agree-
able to us, yet he observed, that all those Tilings chiefly
gratified the coarsest of our Affections; such as our
Ambition, our particular Pride, our Avarice, our Va-
nity, and our Sensuality; all which were, indeed, the
mere Product of the worst Part of Man, were in them-
selves Crimes, and had in them the Seeds of all man-
ner of Crimes; but neither were related to, or con-
cerned with, any of those Virtues that constituted us
K k 2 wif«
wise Men, or of those Graces which distinguished us as
Christians: That being now deprived of all the fancy'd
Felicity, which he enjoyed in the full Exercise of all
those Vices, he said, he was at leisure to look upon the
dark Side of them, where he found all manner of De-
formity; and was now convinced, that Virtue only makes
a Man truly wife, rich, and great, and preserves him in
the Way to a superior Happiness in a future State; and
in this, he said, they were more happy in their Banish-
ment, than all their Enemies were, who had the full
Possession of all the Wealth and Power that they (the
Banilhed) had left behind them.
Nor, Sir, said he, do I bring my Mind to this poli-
tically, by the Necessity of my Circumstances, which
some call miserable; but if I know any Thing of my-
self, I would not go back, no, not though my Master,
the Czar, should call me, and offer to reinstate me in
all my former Grandeur; I say, I would no more go
back to it, than I believe my Soul, when it shall be
delivered from this Prison of the Body, and has had
a Taste of the glorious State beyond Life, would come
back to the Gaol of Flesh and Blood it is now inclosed
in, and leave Heaven to deal in the Dirt and Grime of
human Affairs.
He spoke this with so much Warmth in his Temper,
so much Earnestness and Motion of his Spirits, which
were apparent in his Countenance, that it was evident it
was the true Sense of his Soul. And, indeed, there was
no room to doubt his Sincerity.
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a Mo-
narch in my old Station, of which I had given him an
Account, but that I thought he was not a Monarch
only, but a great Conqueror; for that he that has got
a Victory over his own exorbitant Desires, and has the
absolute Dominion over himself, and whose Reason
intirely governs his Will, is certainly greater than he
that conquers a City. But, my Lord, said I, shall I
take the Liberty to alk you a Question? With all my
Heart, said he. If the Door of your Liberty was open'd,
said I, would not you take hold of it to deliver yourself
from this Exile?
Hold
Hold, said he, your Question is subtle, and requires
some serious just Distinctions; to give it a sincere An-
swer; and Til give it you from the Bottom of my
Heart. Nothing that I know of in this World would
move me to deliver myself from this State of Banifh-
ment, except these two; First, the Enjoyment of my
Relations; and, Secondly, a little warmer Climate;
but I protest to you, that to go back to the Pomp of
the Court, the Glory, the Power, the Hurry of a Mi-
nister of State; the Wealth, the Gaiety, and the Plea-
sures, that is to fay, Follies of a Courtier.,- if my Ma-
ster mould fend me Word this Moment, that he restores
me to all he banished me from; I protest, if 1 know
myself at ail, I would not leave this Wilderness, these
Deserts, and these frozen Lakes, for the Palace of
Muscoiv.
But, my Lord, said I, perhaps you not only are ba-
nished from the Pleasures of the Court, and from the
Power, and Authority, and Wealth, you enjoyed be-
fore; but you may be absent too from some of the
Conveniences of Life; your Estate, perhaps, confis-
cated, and your Effects plundered; and the Supplies
left you here may not be suitable to the ordinary De-
mands of Life.
Ay, said he, that is as you suppose me to be a Lord,
or a Prince, &c. So, indeed, I am; but you are now
to consider me only as a Man, an human Creature, not
at all distinguished from another; and so I can suffer no
Want, unless I mould be visited with Sickness and Di-
stempers. However, to put the Question out of Dis-
pute; you see our Manner; we are in this Place five
Persons of Rank; we live perfectly retired, as suited to
a State of Banishment; we have something rescued from
the Shipwreck of our Fortunes, which keeps us from
the mere Necessity of hunting for our Food, but the
poor Soldiers who are here, without that Help, live in
as much Plenty as we. They go into the WToods, ard
catch Sables and Foxes; the Labour of a Month will
maintain them a Year; and as the Way of Living is
not expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient to our-
selves: So that Objection is out of Doors.
I ha\rc
I have not Room so give a full Account os the most
agreeable Conversation I had with this truly Great
Man; in all which he shewed, that his Mind was so
inspired with a superior Knowledge os Things, so sup-
ported by Religion, as well as by a vast Share of Wis-
dom, that his Contempt of the World was really as
much as he had expressed, and that he was always the
fame to the last, as will appear in the Story I am going
to tell.
I had been here eight Months, and a dark dreadful
Winter I thought it to be; the Cold was so intense,
that I could not so much as look abroad, without be-
ing wrapt in Furs, and a Mask of Fur before my Face,
or rather a Hood, with only an Hole for Breath, and two
for Sight. The little Day-light we had, was, as we
reckoned, for three Months, not above five Hours a
Pay, and fix at most; only that the Snow lying on
the Ground continually, and the Weather clear, it was
never quite dark. Our Horses were kept (or rather
starved) under-ground; and, as for our Servants (for
we hired Servants here to look after our Horses and
selves), we had every now-and-then their Fingers and
Toes to thaw, and take care of, lest they should mortify
and fall off.
It is true, within Doors we were warm, the Houses
being close, the Walls thick, the Lights small, and the
Glass all double. Our Food was chiefly the Flem of
Deer, dry'd and cur'd in the Season; good Bread enough,
but baked as Biscuits; dried Fish of several Sorts, and
some Flesh of Mutton, and of the Buffaloes, which- is
pretty good Beef. All the Stores of Provision for the
Winter are laid up in the Summer, and well cur'd; our
Prink- was Water mixed with^«ct vita instead of Brandy;
and, for a Treat, Mead instead of Wine » which, how-
ever, they have excellent good. The Hunters, who ven-
ture abroad all Weathers, frequently brought us in fresh
Venison, very fat and good; and sometimes Bears Flesh,
but we did not much care for the last. We had a good
Stock of Tea, with which we treated our Friends as a-
bove; and, in a Word, we lived very chearfully and
well, all Things considered.
It
It was now March, and the Days grown consider-
ably longer, and the Weather at least tolerable; so other
Travellers began to prepare Sleds to carry them over
the Snow, and to get Things ready to be going; but
my Measures being fixed, as I have said, for Arch-
Angel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made na
Motion; knowing very well, that the Ships from the
South do not set out for that Part of the World till
May or June; and that if I was there at the Beginning
of August, it would be as soon as any Ships would be
ready to go away; and therefore, I fay, I made no
Haste to be gone, as others did j in a word, I saw a
great many People, nay, all the Travellers, go away
before me. It ieems, every Year they go from thence
to MuJc<no for Trade; <uiz. to carry Furs, and buy
Necessaries with them, which they bring back to fur-
nish their Shops; also others went on the fame Errand
to Arch-Angel but then they also, being to come back
again above eight hundred Miles, went all out before
me.
In short, about, the latter Ertd of May I began to
make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this, it
occurred to me, that leeing all these People were ba-
nished by the Czar of Muse&uy to Siberia, and yet, when
they came there, were at Liberty to go whither they
would; why did they not then go away to any Part of
the World wherever they thought 'sit? And I began to
examine what lhould hinder them frpm making such an
Attempt.
But my Wonder was over, when I entered upon
that Subject with the Person I have mentioned, who
answered me thus: Consider, first, Sir, said he, the
Place where we are; and, secondly, the Condition we
are in; especially, said he, the Generality of the People
who are banished hither. We are surrounded, said he,
with stronger Things than Bars and Bolts; on the
North Side is an unnavigable Ocean, where Ship never
sailed, and Boat never swam ; neither, if we had both,
could we know whither to go with them. Every
other Way, said he, we have above 1000 Miles to pals
through the Czar's own Dominions, and By-ways ut^
terly impassable, except by the Roads made by the
Govern*
Government, and through the Towns garisoned by his
Troops; so that we could neither pass undiscovered by
the Road, or subsist any other Way; so that it is in vain
to attempt it.
I was silenced, indeed, at once, and sound that they
were in a Prison, every jot as secure, as if they had
been locked up in the Castle of Moscow; however, it
came into my Thoughts, that I might certainly be
made an Instrument to procure the Escape of this ex-
cellent Person, and that it was very easy for me to
carry him away, there being no Guard over him in the
Country; and as I was not going to Mosoiv, but to
Arch-Angel, and that I went in the Nature of a Cara-
van, by which I was not obliged to lie in the Stationary
Towns in the Desert, but could encamp every Night
where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to
Arch-Jngel, where I would immediately secure him on
board an English or Dutch Ship, and carry him off safe
along with me; and, as to his Subsistence, and other
Particulars, that mould be my Care, till he mould bet-
ter supply himself.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his
very Face, that what I said put his Spirits into an ex-
ceeding Ferment; his Colour frequently changed, his
Eyes looked red, and his Fleart fluttered, that it might
be even perceived in his Countenance; nor could he im-
mediately answer me, when I had done, and, as it were,
expected what he would fay to it; and after he had
paus'd a little, he embraced me, and said, How unhappy
are we! unguided Creatures as we are, that even our
greatest Acts of Friendship are made Snares to us, and
we are made Tempters of one another I My dear
Friend, said he, your Offer is so sincere, has such
Kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so
calculated for my Advantage, that I must have very
little Knowledge os the World, if I did not both won-
der at it, and acknowledge the Obligation I have upon
me to you for it: But did you believe I was. sincere
in what I have so often said to you of my Contempt
of the World? Did you believe I spoke my very Soul
to you, and that I had really maintained that Degree
of Felicity here, that had placed me above a$ that the
World could give me, or do for me? Did you believe
I was sincere, when I told you I would not go back,
if I was recalled even to be all that once I was in the
Court, and with the Favour of the Czar my Master I
Did you believe me, my Friend, to be an honest Man,
or. did you think me to be a boasting Hypocrite? Here
he stopped, as if he would hear what I would fay 5 but,
indeed, I soon after perceived, that he stopped because
his Spirits were in Motion; his Heart was full . of
Struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I con*
fefs, astonished at the Thing as well as at the Man,,
and I used some Arguments with him to urge him to set
himself free: That he ought to look upon this as a
Door opened by Heaven for his Deliverance, and a Sum-
mons by Providence, who has the Care and good Dispo-
sition of ail Events, to do himself good, and to render
himself useful in the World.
He had by this time recovered himself; How do
you know, Sir, said he, warmly, but that instead of a
Summons from Heaven, it may be a Feint of another
Instrument, representing, in all the alluring Colours, to
me, the Shew of Felicity as a Deliverance, which may
in itself be my Snare, and tend^directly to my Ruin?
Here I am free from the Temptation of returning to
my former miserable Greatness; there I am not sure,
but that all the Seeds of Pride, Ambition, Avarice, and
Luxury, which I know remain in Nature, may revive
and take Root, and, in a word, again overwhelm me;
and then the happy Prisoner, whom you see now Ma-
ster of his Soul's Liberty, shall Jae the miserable Slave of
his own Senses, in she full of all personal Liberty. Dear
Sir, let me .remain in this blessed Confinement, banished
from the Crimes of Life, rather than purchase a Shew
of Freedom, at the Expence of the Liberty of my Rea-
son, and at the*Expence of the future Happiness which
now I have in my View, but shall then, I fear, quickly
lose Sight of; for I am but Flesh, a Man, a mere Man;
have Passions and Affections as likely to possess and
overthrow me as any Man: A be not my Friend and
my Tempter both together!
, Vol. II. Nc. 24. LI Jf
If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent, looking at him; and, indeed, admired
what I saw; the Struggle in his Soul was so great,
that though the Weather was extremely cold, it put him
into a most violent Sweat, and I found he wanted to
give Vent to his Mind; so I said a Word or two, that
I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on
him again; and then I withdrew to my own Apart-
ment.
About two Hours after, I heard somebody at or near
the Door of the Room, and I was going to open the
Door; but he had opened it, and came in: My dear
Friend, said he, you had almost overset me, but I am
recovered: Do not take it ill that I do not close with
your Offer; I assure you, 'tis not for want of a Sense
of the Kindness of it in you; and I came to make the
most sincere Acknowledgement of it to you; but* I
hope, I have got the Victory over myself.
My Lord, said. I, I hope you are fully satisfied, that
you ao not resist the Call os Heaven. Sir, said he, if it
had been from Heaven, the same Power would have in-
fluenced me to accept it; but, I hope, and am fully
satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I decline it; and
I have an infinite Satis/action in the Parting, that you
shall leave me an honest Man still, though not a free
Man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiese, and make Pro-
fessions to him of my having no End in it, but a sincere
Desire to serve him. He embraced me very passion-
ately, and assured me, he was sensible of that, and
should always acknowledge it; and with that he offered
me a very fine Present of Sables, too much, indeed,
for me to accept from a Man in his Circumstances; and
I would have avoided them, but he would not be re-
fused.
- The next Morning I sent my Servant to his Lord-
ship, with a small Present of Tea, two Pieces of China
Damask, and four little Wedges of Jafan Gold, which
did not all weigh above fix Ounces, or thereabouts; but
were far short of the Value of his Sables, which, in-
deed, when I came to England, I found worth near two
hundred Pounds, He accepted the Tea, and one Piece
of the Damask, and one os the Pieces of Gold, which
had a fine Stamp upon it, of the Japan Coinage, which
I found he took for the Rarity of it, but wdald not
take any more; and sent word by my Servant, that he
desired to speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what
had passed between us, and hoped I would not move
him any more in that Affair; but that, since I made
such a generous Offer to him, he a/k'd me, if I had
Kindness enough to offer the fame to another Person
that he would name to me, in whom he had a great
Share of Concern. I told him. That I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for
whom I had a particular Value, and should have been.
lad to have been the Instrument of his Deliverance;
owever, if he would please to name the Person to me,
I would give him my Answer, and hoped he would
not be displeased with me, if he was with my Answer.
He told me, it was only his Son, who, though I had
not seen, yet was in the fame Condition with himself,
and above two hundred Miles from him, on the other
Side the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would send
for him.
I made no Hesitation, but told him I would do it:
I made some Ceremony in letting him understand, that
it was wholly on his Account; and that feeing I coul€
not prevail on him, I would shew my Respect to him,
by my Concern for his Son: But these things are too
tedious to repeat here. He sent away the next Day
for his Son, and in about 20 Days he came back with
the Messenger, bringing fix or seven Horses, loaded
with very rich Furs, and which, in the Whole, amounted
to a very great Value.
His Servants brought the Horses into the Town, but
left the young Lord at a Distance till Night, when he
came incognito into our Apartment, and his Father pre-
sented him to me; and, in short, we concerted there
the manner of our Travelling, and every tiling proper
for the Journey.
I had bought a considerable Quantity of Sables, black
fox-skins, fine Ermins, and such other Furs that are
very rich; I fay, I had bought them in that City for
L 1 2 Exchange
JExch&nge for fipne of the Goods brought from China i
in particular, lor the Cloves and Netmegs, of which I
fold the greatest Part here, and the rest afterwards at
4rchangely for a much better Price than I could have
done at London; and my Partner who was sensible of
the Profit, and whose Business more particularly than
mine was Merchandise, * was mightily pleased with our
Stay, on Account of the TrafRck we made here.
It was the Beginning of June, when I left this re-
mote Place, a City, I believe, little heard of in the
World; and, indeed, it is ib far out of the Road of
Commerce, that I know not how it should be mucji
talked of. We were now come to a very small Cara-
van, being only thirty-two Horses and Camels, in all,
and all of them pasted for mine, though my new Guest
was Proprietor of 11 of them. It was most natural
also, that I should take more Servants with me than I
had before, and the young Lord pasted for my Stew-
ard; what Great Man I pass'd for myself, I know not,
neither did it concern me to inquire. We had here
."the worst and the largest PeYert to pass over that we
m.et with in all the Journey; indeed I call it the worst,
because the Way was very deep in some Places, and
very uneven in others; the best we had to fay for it,
was, that we thought we had no Troops of Tar/aw
and Robbers to fear, and that they never came on this
Side the 'River Oby, or at least but very seldom; but
we found it otherwise.
My young Lord had with him a faithful Muscovite
Servant, or rather a Siberian Servant, who was per-
fectly acquainted with the Country; and who led us
"by private Roads, that we avoided coming into 'the
principal Towns and Cities, upon the great Road, such
as Tumen, Soloy-Kanwjkoy, and several others; because
the Muscovite Garrisons which are kept there, are very
curious and strict in their Observation upon Travellers,
and searching lest any of the banilhed Persons of Note
Ihpuld make their Escape that Way into Muscovy^; but
by this means, as we were kept out of the Cities, so
our whole Journey was a Desert, and we were oblig'd
tq encamp and lie in our Tents, when we might have
had good Accommodation in the Cities on the Way^:.
This the young Lord was so sensible os, that he would
not allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several
Cities on the Way; but lay abroad himself, with his
Sen/ant, in the Woods, and met us always at the ap-
pointed Places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed the Ri-
ver Kama, which; in these Parts, is the Boundary be-
tween Europe and djta; and the first City on the Eu-
ropean Side was called Soloy-Kamojkoy, which is as much
as to fay, the great City on the River Kama ; and here
we thought to nave seen some evident Alteration in the
People, their Manners, their Habit, their Religion, and
their Business; but we were mistaken; for as we had
a vast Desert to pass, which, by Relation, is near seven
Jiundred Miles long in some Places, but not above two
hundred Miles over where we passM it; so, till we
.cahie past that horrible Place, we sound very little Dif-
ference between that Country and the Mogul Tartary;
the People mostly Pagans, and little better than the
Savages of America; their Houses and Towns full of
Idols, and their way of Living wholly barbarous, ex-
cept in the Cities as above, and the Villages near
them ;. where they are Christians, as they call them-
selves, of the Greek Church j but even these have their
Religion mingled with so many Rcliques of Supersti-
tion, that it is scarce to be known in some Places from
mere Sorcery and Witchcraft.
In palling this Forest, I thought, indeed, we mud,
after all our Dangers were, in our Imagination, escaped,
as before, have been plundered and robbed, and, per-
haps murdered by a Troop of Thieves; of what Counv
try they were, whether the roving Bands of the Ojlia-
chi, a kind of Tartars, or wild People on the Bank of
the Oby, had rang'd thus far; or whether they were
the Sable-hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a Loss t$
know; but they were all on Horseback, earned Bows
and Arrows, and were at first about five and-forty in
Number; they came so near to us, as within about
two Musquet-stiot; and, asking no Questions, they fmv
rounded us with their Horse, and looked very earnestly
upon us twice; at length they placed thejnjfelves
\\\ oqr Way .; upon which we drew up in a little LJjjk
befetfe
before our Camels, being not above sixteen Men in alf %
and being drawn up thus, we halted, and sent out the
Siberian Servant, who attended his Lord, to fee who
they were; "his Master was the more willing to let him
go, because he was not a little apprehensive, that they
were a Siberian Troop sent out after him. The Man
came up near tlKm with a Flag of Truce, and called
to them; but though he spoke several of their Lan-
guages, or Dialects of Languages rather, he could not
understand a Word they said; however, after some
Signs to him, not to come nearer to them at his Pe~
ril; so he said he understood them to mean, offering to
shoot at him if he advanced; the Fellow came back no
wiser then he went, only that by their Dress, he said,
he believed them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of
the Circassian Hords; and that there must be more of
them on the great Desert, though he never heard, that
tver any of them were seen so far North before.
This was small Comfort to us; however, we had
no Remedy: There was on our Left Hand, at about a
Quarter of a Mile's Distance, a little Grove or Clump
of Trees, which stood close together, and very near
the Road: I immediately resolved we would advance
to those Trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we
"could there; for, first, I considered that the Trees would
in great measure cover us from their Arrows $ and, in
the next Place, they could not come to charge us in &
Body: It was, indeed, my old Portuguese Pilot who
proposed it; and who had this Excellency attending
liim, namely, that he was always readiest and most apt
\o direct and encourage us, in Cafes of the most Dan-
ger. We advanced immediately with what Speed we
£outd, and gain'd that little Wood, the Tartars or
Thieves, for we knew not what to call them, keep-
ing their Stand, and not attempting to hinder us.
When we came thither, we found, to our great Satis-
faction, that it was a swampy springy Piece of Ground,
"and,. on the other Side, a very great Spring of Water,
which running out in a little Rill or Brook, was a
little farther joined by another of the like Bigness, and
in^ihlort, the Head or Source of a considerable
Ijterer, called afterwards"' she. IVirtjka; the. Trees which
grew
grew about this Spring, were not in all above two
hundred* but were very large, and flood pretty thick;
ib that as soon as we got in, we saw ourselves perfectly
safe from the Enemy, unless they alighted and attacked
us on Foot.
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese* with
indefatigable Application, cut down great Arms of the
Trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite off, from
one Tree to another; so that he made a continued
Fence, almost round us.
We staid here, waiting the Motion of the Enemy
some Hours, without perceiving they made any Offer
to stir; when, about two Hours before Night, they
came down directly upon us; and, though we had not
perceived it, we found they had been joined by some
more of the fame, so that they were near fourscore
Horse, whereof, however, we fansy'd some were Wo-
men. They came on till they were within half a Shot-
of our little Wood, when we fired one Musquet with-
out Ball, and called to them in the RuJJtan Tongue; to>
know what they wanted, and bid them keep off; but^
as if they knew nothing of what we said, they came>
k on with a double Fury directly up to the Wood-ficfc*
not imagining we were so barricado'd, that they could
not break in: Our old Pilot was our Captain, as well
as he had been ourJSngineer; and desired of us, not
to fire upon them till they came within Pistol-mot, that
we might be sure to kill; and that when we did fire*
we mould be sure to take good Aim. We bade him*
give the Word of Command; which he delayed sa.
long, that they were, some of them, within two Pikes,
Length of us when we fired.
We aimed so true (or Providence directed our Shot
so sure) that we killed fourteen of them at the first
Volley, and wounded several others, as also several of
their Horses; for we had all of us loaded our Pieces,
with two or three Bullets apiece, at least.
They were terribly surprised with ou^FIre, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred Rods from us;
in which time we loaded our Pieces again, and,., feeing-
them keep that Distance, we sallied out, and caught
four or five of their Horses, whose Riders, we sup-
pose d^.
posed, were killed; and, coming up to the Dead, we
could easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew not
from what Country, or how they came to make an
Excursion such an unusual Length.
About an Hour after they made a Motion to attack
us again, and rode round our little Wood, to see where
else they might break in; but finding us always ready
to face them, they went off again, and we resolved
not to stir from the Place for that Night.
We slept a little, you may be sure; but spent the most
Part of the Night in strengthening our Situation, and
barricadoing the Entrances into the Wood; and, keep-
ing a strict Watch, we waited for Day-iighty and, when
it came, it gave us a very unwelcome Discovery in-
deed; for the Enemy, who we thought were discou-
raged with the Reception they had met with, were
oow increased to no less than three hundred, and had
set up eleven or twelve Huts and Tents, as if they
were resolved to besiege us; and this little Camp they
had ^pitched, was upon the open Plain, at about three
Quarters of a Mile from us. We were, indeed, sur-
prised at this Discovery; and.now, I confess, I gave
myself over for lost, and all that I had. The Loss of
my Effects did not lie so near me (though they were
very considerable) as the Thoughts of falling into the
Hands of such Barbarians, at the latter End of my
Journey, after so many Difficulties "and Hazards as I
had gone thro1; and even in Sight of our Port, where
we expected Safety and Deliverance. As for my Part-
ner, lie was raging: He declared, that to lose his Goods
would be his Ruin; and he would rather die than be
starved; and he was for sighting to the last Drop.
The young Lord, as gallant as ever Fleih shewed
itself, was for fighting to the last also; and my old Pi-
lot was of the Opinion we were able to resist them
all, in the Situation we then were in; and thus we
spent the Day in Debates of what we should do; but
towards Evening we found, that the Number of our
Enemies still increased: Perhaps, as they were abroad
in several Parties for Prey, the first had sent out Scouts
to call for Help, and to acquaint them of the Booty;
3.nd we. did not know but by the Morning they anight.
ftill be a greater Number; so I began to inquire of those
People we had brought from Toboljki, if there was no
other, or more private Ways, by which we mighjt
avoid them in the Night* and, perhaps, either retreat
to some Town, or get Help to guard us over the De-
sert.
The Siberia*) who was Servant to the young Lord,
told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight,
he would engage to carry us off in the Night to a
Way that went North toward the River Petraz, by
which he made no question but we might get away,
and the Tartars never the wiser $ but he said, his Lord
Jiad told him he would not return, but would rather
chuse to fight. I told him he mistook his Lord; for
that he was too wife a Man to love fighting for the fake
of it; that I knew his Lord was brave enough, by what
he had mewed already ; but that his Lord knew better,
than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen Men fight
five hundred, unless an unavoidable Necessity forced
them to it; and that if he thought it possible for us
to escape in the Night, we had nothing else to do but
to attempt it. He answered, If his Lord gave him
such Order, he would lose his Life, if he did not per-
form it. We soon brought his Lord to give that Or-
der, tho' privately, and we immediately prepared for
the putting it in Practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled
a Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burning, and
prepared so as to make it burn all Night, that the Tar~
tars might conclude we were still there; but as soon
as it was dark (that is to fay,) so as we could fee the
Stars (for our Guide would not stir before) having all
pur Horses and Camels ready loaden, we followed our
new Guide, who, I soon found, steered himself by the
Pole, or North Star, all the Country being level for a
long Way.
After we had travelled two Hours very hard> it be-
gan to be lighter still; not that it was quite dark all
Night, but the Moon began to rife, so that, in short,
it was rather lighter than we wished it to be; but by
fix o'Clock next Morning we were gotten near fort*
Miles, though the Truth is, we almost spoiled our
Vol. IL Mm Horses.
Horses. Here we found a Ruffian Village named Kir-
maxhrjkoy, where we rested, and heard nothing of the
Ca/muck Tartars that Day. About two Hours before
Night we set out again, and travelled till eight the
next Morning, though not quite so hastily as before;
and about seven o'Clock we passed a little River called
Kirtza, and came to a good large Town inhabited by
Ruffiansf and very populous, called Ozowys: There we
heard, that several Troops or Hords of Ca/much had
been abroad upon the Desert, but that we were now
completely out of Danger of them, which was to our
great Satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we were
obliged to get some fresh Horses, and, having need
enough of Rest, we staid five Days; and my Partner
and I agreed to give the honest Siberian, who brought
us thitjaer, the Value of ten Pistoles for his conducting
US,
In five Days more we came to Veuffima, upon the
River Wltxogda, which running into the River Divina^
we were there very happily near the End of our Tra-
vels by Land, that River being navigable in seven
J>ays Passage to Archangel: From hence we came to
Larurenjkoy, where the Rjver joins, the third of July;
and provided ourselves with two Luggage-boats, and a
Barge, for our Convenience; we embarked the 7th>
and arrived all safe at Archangel the 18th, having been
a Year, five Months, and three Days, on the Journey,
including our Stay of eight Months and pdd Pays at
We were obliged to stay at this Place fix Weeks for
the Arrival of the Ships j and must have tarried longer,
had not a Hamburgher come in above a Month sooner
than any of the English Ships; when after some Con-
sideration, that the City of Hamburgh might happen
to be as good a Market for our Goods as London, we
all took Freight with him,-; and, having put our Goods
on board, it was most natural for me to put my Stew-
ard on board to take care of them; by which means
my young J^ord had a sufficient Opportunity to con-
ceal himself, never coming on shore again in all the
Time we staid there; and this he did, that he might
«pt be seen in the City, where some of the Moscow
3 JVIer-t
Merchants would certainly have seen and discovered
him.
We sailed from Archangel the 20th of August the
feme Year j and, after no extraordinary bad Voyage,
Arrived in the Elbe, the 13th of September: Here my
Partner and I found a very good Sale for our Goods>
as well those of China, as the Sables, &c. of Siberia;
and dividing the Produce of our Effects, my Share
amounted to 3475/. 17s* $d, notwithstanding 10 many
LoiTes we had sustained, and Charges we .had been at;
only remembring that I had included, in.this, about
six hundred Pounds-worth of Diamonds, whick I ha4
purchased at Bengal.
Here the young Lord took his Leave of us, and
went up the E/be, in order to go to the Court of Vi-
enna, where he resolved to seek Protection, and where
he could correspond with those of his Fathers Friends wh«
were left alive. He did not part without all the Testimo-
nies he could give, of Gratitude for the Service I had
done him, and his Sense of my Kindness to the Prince
his Father.
To conclude, having stayed near four Months in Ham*
burgb, I came from thence, over Land to the Hague, where
I embarked in the Packet, and arrived in London, the 10th
of January\ lJO$, having been gone from England ten
Years and nine Months.
And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I am
preparing for a longer Journey than all these, having lived
72 Years a Life of iniinite Variety, and learned susticz-
eptly to know- the Value of Retirement, and the Bleiling *
of ending our Pays in Peace.
