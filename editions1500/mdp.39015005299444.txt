THE LIFE OF
COLONEL JACK
IW A S now at the Height of my good Fortune; indeed
I was in very good Circumstances, and being of a fru-
gal Temper from the Beginning, I sav'd Things to-
gether as they came, and yet liv'd very well too; particu-
larly I had the Reputation of a very considerable Mer-
chant, and one that came over vastly Rich from Virginia,
and as I frequently brought Supplies for my several Fa-
milies and Plantations there, as they wrote to me for them
so I pass'd (I say) for a great Merchant.
I liv'd single indeed, and in Lodgings, but I began to
be very well known, and tho' I had subscrib'd my Name
only Jack to my particular Correspondent,yet the French,
among whom I liv'd near a Year, (as I have said) not un-
derstanding what 7^ meant, call'd me Monsieur Jacque,
and Colonel Jacques, and so gradually Colonel Jacque; so
I was call'd in the Certificate of exchanging me with the
other Prisoner, so that I went so also into Flanders; upon
which, and seeing my Certificate of Exchange, (as above)
I was call'd Colonel Jaques in England,by my Friend,who
I call'd Correspondent; and thus I pass'd for a Foreigner,
and a Frenchman, and I was infinitely fond of havingevery
Body take me for a Frenchman; and as I spoke French very
well, having learn'd it by continuing so long among them:
so I went constantly to the French-Church in London, and
spoke French upon all Occasions, as much as I could, and
VOl. ii b
2 The Li fe of Colonel Jac k
to compleat the Appearance of it, I got me a French Ser-
vant to do my Business, I mean as to my Merchandise,
which only consisted in receiving and disposingof Tobacco
of which I had about 500 to 600 Hogsheads a Year from
my own Plantations, and in supplying my People with
Necessaries, as they wanted them.
In this private Condition I continued about two Year
more, when the Devil owing me a Spleen, ever since I re-
fus'd being a Thief, paid me Home, with my Interest, by
laying a Snare in my Way, which had almost ruined me.
There dwelt a Lady, in the House opposite to the
House I lodg'd in, who made an extraordinary Figure, in
deed she went very well dress'd, and was a most beautiful
Person; she was well bred,sung admirably fine,and some-
times I could hear her very distinctly, the Houses being
over-against one another, in a narrow Court, not much
unlike Three-King-Court in Lombard-Street.
This Lady put herself so often in my Way, that I could
not in good Manners forbear taking Notice of her, and
giving her the Ceremony of my Hat, when I saw her at the
Window, or at the Door, or when I pass'd her in the
Court, so that we became almost acquainted at a Distance;
sometimes she also visited at the House I lodg'd at, and it
was generally contriv'd,that I should be introduced when
she came; and thus by Degrees we became more intimate-
ly acquainted,and often convers'd together in the Family,
but always in Publick, at least for a great while.
I was a meer Boy in the Affair of Love, and knew the
least of what belong'd to a Woman, of any Man in Europe
of my Age; the Thoughts of a Wife, much less of a Mis-
tress, had never so much as taken the least hold of my
Head, and I had been till now as perfectly unacquainted
with the Sex, and as unconcern'd about them, as I was
when I was ten Year old, and lay in a Heap of Ashes at a
Glass-House.
But I know not by what Witchcraft, in the Conversa-
tion of this Woman, and her singling me out upon several
Occasions, I began to be ensnared, I knew not how, or to
what End; and was on a sudden so embarrass'd in my
Thoughts about her, that like a Charm she had me always
in her Circle; if she had not been one of the subtilest Wo-
men on Earth, she could never have brought me to have
given myself the least Trouble about her; but I, drawn in
by the Magick of a Genius,capable to deceive a more wary
Capacity than mine, and it was impossible to resist her.
She attack'd me without ceasing, with the Fineness of
her Conduct, and with Arts, which were impossible to be
ineffectual; she was ever (as it were) in my View, often in
my Company, and yet kept herself so on the Reserve, so
surrounded continuallywithObstructions,that for several
Months after she could perceive I sought an Opportunity
to speak to her, she rendered it impossible, nor could I
ever break in upon her, she kept her Guard so well.
Th1s rigid Behaviour was the greatest Mystery that
could be, considering at the same Time, that she never
declined my seeing her,or conversing with me in Publick;
but she held it on, she took Care never to sit next me, that
I might slip no Paper into her Hand, or speak softly to
her; she kept some Body or other always between, that I
could never come up to her; and thus, as if she was resolv'd
really to have nothing to do with me, she held me at the
Bay several Months.
All this while nothing was more certain than that she
intended to have me, if she could catch, and it was indeed
a kind of a Catch, for she manag'd all by Art,and drew me
in with the most resolute Backwardness, that it was almost
impossible not to be deceiv'd by it; on the other Hand,
she did not appear to be a Woman despicable, neither was
she poor, or in a Condition that should require so much
Art to draw any Man in; but the Cheat was really on my
Side; for she was unhappily told, that I was vastly Rich, a
great Merchant, and that she would live like a Queen,
which I was not at all instrumental in putting upon her,
neither did I know that she went upon that Motive.
She was too cunning to let me perceive how easy she
was to be had; on the contrary, she run all the Hazards of
bringing me to neglect her entirely, that one would think
any Woman in the World could do; and I have wondered
often since, that how it was possible it should fail of mak-
ing me perfectly averse to her; for as I had a perfect In-
differency for the whole Sex, and never, till then, enter-
tained any Notion of them, they were no more to me than
a Picture hanging up against a Wall.
As we convers'd freely together in Publick, so she took
a great many Occasions to rally the Men, and the Weak-
ness they were guilty of, in letting the Women insult
them as they did; she thought if the Men had been Fools,
Marriage had been only Treaties of Peace between two
Neighbours, or Alliances offensive or defensive, which
must necessarily have been carried on sometimes by In-
terviews, and personal Treaties; but oftner by Ambassa-
dors, Agents, and Emissaries on both Sides; but that the
Women had outwitted us, and brought us upon our
Knees, and made us whine after them, and lower our-
selves, so as we could never pretend to gain our Equality
again.
I told her I thought it was a Decency to the Ladies, to
give them the Advantage of denying a little, that they
might be courted, and that I should not like a Woman the
worse for denying me. I expect it Madam, says I, when I
wait on you To-morrow, intimating, that I intended it;
you shan't be deceiv'd Sir, says she, for I'll deny now, be-
fore you ask me the Question.
I was dash'd so effectually, with so malicious, so devil-
ish an Answer, that I return'd with a little Sullenness; I
shan't Trespass upon you yet Madam, and I shall be very
careful not to offend you when I do.
It is the greatest Token of your Respect Sir, says she,
that you are able to bestow upon me, and the most agree-
able too, except one, which I will not be out of Hopes of
obtaining of you in a little Time.
What is in my Power to oblige you in Madam, said I,
you may command me in at any Time, especially the Way
we are talking of; this I spoke still with a Resentment
very sincere.
'Tis only, Sir, that you would promise to hate me with
as much Sincerity, as I will endeavour to make you a suit-
able Return.
I granted that Request, Madam, seven Year before
you ask'd it, said I, for I heartily hated the whole Sex, and
scarce know how I came to abate that good Disposition in
Compliment to your Conversation; but I assure you that
Abatement is so little, that it does no Injury to your Pro-
posal.
There's some Mystery in that indeed, Sir, said she, for
I desir'd to assist your Aversion to Women in a more par-
ticular Manner,andhop'd it should never abate undermy
Management. We said a Thousand ill-natured Things
after this, but she out-did me, for she had such a Stock of
Bitterness upon her Tongue, as no Woman ever went be-
yond her, and yet all this while she was the pleasantest,
and most obliging Creature in every Part of our Conver-
sation that could possibly be, and meant not one Word of
what she said, no, not a Word: But I must confess, it no
way answer'd her End; for it really cooled all my Thoughts
of her, and I, that had liv'd in so perfect an Indifferency to
the Sex all my Days, was easily return'd to that Condition
again, and began to grow very cold and negligent in my
usual Respects to her upon all Occasions.
She soon found she had gone too far with me; and in
short, that shewas extreamly out in her Politicks, that she
had to do with one that was not lifted yet among the
whining Sort of Lovers, and knew not what it was to adore
a Mistress, in order to abuse her; and that it was not with
me, as it was with the usual Sort of Men in Love, that are
warm'd by the Cold, and rise in their Passions, as the La-
dies fall in their Returns; on the contrary, she found that
it was quite alter'd; I was civil to her, as before, but not so
forward, when I saw her at her Chamber Window, I did
not throw mine open, as I usually had done, to talk with
her; when she sung in the Parlour, where I could easily
hear it, I did not listen; when she visited at the House
where I lodg'd, I did not always come down, or if I did, I
had Business which oblig'd me to go Abroad, and yet all
this while, when I did come into her Company, I was as
intimate as ever.
I could easily see that this madded her to the Heart,
and that she was perplex'd to the last Degree, for she
found that she had all her Game to play over again; that so
absolute a Reservedness, even to Rudeness and ill Man-
ners, was a little too much; but she was a meer Posture
Mispress in Love, and could put herself into what Shapes
she pleas'd.
She was too wise to shewa Fondness or Forwardness,
that look'd like Kindness, she knew that was the meanest,
and last Step a Woman can take, and lays her under the
Foot of the Man she pretends to; Fondness is not the last
Favour indeed, but it is the last Favour but one, that a
Woman can grant, and lays her almost as low, I mean i t
lays her at the Mercy of the Man she shews it to, but she
was not come to that neither: This Camelion put on an -
other Colour, turn'd on a sudden the gravest, soberest,
majestick Madam, so that any one would have thought
she was advanced in Age in one Week, from Two and
Twenty to Fifty, and this she carried on with so much
Government of herself, that it did not in the least looklike
Art; but if it was a Representation of Nature only, it was
so like Nature itself, that no Body living can be able to dis-
tinguish; she sung very often in her Parlour, as well by
herself as with two young Ladies, who came often to see
her; I could see by their Books, and her Guitar in her
Hand, that she was singing, but she never open'd the
Window, she kept her own always shut, or if it was open,
she would be sitting at Work, and not look up, it may be,
once in half an Hour.
If she saw me by Accident all this while, she would
smile, and speak as chearfully as ever, but it was but a
Word or two, and so make her Honours and be gone; so
that in a Word, we convers'd just as we did, after I had
been there a Week.
She tired me quite out at this Work, for tho' I began
the Strangeness indeed, yet I did not design the carrying
it on so far; but she held it to the last, just in the same
Manner as she began it: She came to the House where I
lodg'd as usual, and we were often together, supp'd to-
gether, play'd Cards together, danc'd together; for in
France I accomplish'd myself with every Thing that was
needful, to make me what I believ'd myself to be even
from a Boy, I mean a Gentleman; I say, we convers'd to-
gether, as above, but she was so perfectly another Thing
than what she us'd to be in every Part of her Conversation,
that it presently occurr'd to me, that her former Behaviour
was a kind of a Rant, or Fit; that either it was the Effect
of some extraordinary Levity that had come upon her, or
that it was done to mimick the Coquets of the Town, be-
lieving it might take with me, who she thought was a
Frenchman, and that it was what I lov'd; but her new Gra-
vity was her real natural Temper, and indeed became it
her so much better, or as I should say, she acted it so well,
that it really brought me back to have, not as much only,
but more Mind to her than ever I had before.
However, it was a great while before I discover'd my-
self, and I staid indeed to find out, if possible, whether
this Change was real or counterfeit; for I could not easily
believe it was possible the gay Humour she us'd to appear
in could be a Counterfeit; it was not therefore till a Year
and almost a Quarter, that I came to any Resolution in my
Thoughts about her, when on a meer Accident we came
to a little Conversation together.
She came to visit at our House as usual, and ithappen'd
all the Ladies were gone Abroad; but as it fell out, I was
in the Passage, or Entry of the House, going towards the
Stairs, when she knock'd at the Door; so stepping back, I
open'd the Door, and she, without any Ceremony, came
in, and run forward into the Parlour, supposing the Wo-
men had been there, I went in after her, as I could do no
less, because she did know that the Family was Abroad.
Upon my coming in, she ask'd for the Ladies, I told
her, I hop'd she came to visit me now, for that the Ladies
were all gone Abroad: Are they (said she) as if surpriz'd
(tho' as I understood afterwards she knew it before, as also
that I was at Home) and then rises up to be gone: No Ma-
dam, said I, pray do not go; when Ladies come to visit me
I do not use to tire them of my Company so soon; that's as
ill-natured, says she, as you could possibly talk, pray don't
pretend I came to visit you, I am satisfy'd who I came to
visit, and satisfy'd that you know it; yes Madam, said I,
but if I happen to be all of the Family that's left at Home,
then you came to visit me.
I never receive Visits from those that I hate, says she.
You have me there indeed, said I, but you never gave
me Leave to tell you, why I hated you, I hated you because
you would never give me an Opportunity to tell you I
lov'd you; sure, you took me for some frightful Creature
that you would never come near enough, so much as to
whisper to you that I love you.
I never care to hear any Thing so disagreeable, says
she, tho' it be spoken ever so softly.
We rallied thus for an Hour; in short, she shewed the
Abundance of her Wit, and I an abundant Deficiency of
mine; for tho' three or four Times she provok'd me to the
last Degree, so that once I was going to tell her I had
enough of her Company, and if she pleas'd I would wait
upon her to the Door; yet she had always so much Witch-
craft on her Tongue, that she brought herself off again;
till, to make the Story short, we came at last to talk seri-
ously on both Sides about Matrimony, and she heard me
freely propose it, and answered me directly upon many
Occasions: For Example, she told me, I would carry her
away to France, or to Virginia, and that she could not
think of leaving England, her native Country; I told her,
I hop'd she did not take me for a Kidnapper: By the way,
I did not tell her how I had been Kidnapp'd myself: She
said no, but the Consequence of my Affairs, which were
it seems mostly Abroad, might oblige me to go, and she
could never think of marrying any Man, that she could
not be content to go all over the World with, if he had oc-
casion to go himself. This was handsomely expressed in-
deed, I made her easy in that Point, and thus we began
the grand Parley, which indeed she drew me into with the
utmost Art and Subtilty, such as was peculiar to herself,
but was infinitely her Advantage in our treating of Mar-
riage; for she made me effectually court her, tho' at the
same Time in her Design she courted me with the utmost
Skill, and such Skill it was, that her Design was perfectly
impenetrable to the last Moment.
In short, we came nearer and nearer every Time we
met, and after one casual Visit more, in which I had the
mighty Favour of talking with her alone; I then waited
on her every Day at her own House, or Lodgings rather,
and so we set about the Work to a Purpose, and in about
a Month we gave the World the slip, and were privately
marry'd to avoid Ceremony, and the publick Inconveni-
ency of a Wedding.
We soon found a House proper for our Dwelling, and
so went to House-keeping; we had not been long together,
but I found that gay Temper of my Wife return'd, and
she threw off the Mask of her Gravity, and good Con-
duct, that I had so long fancy'd was her meer natural Dis-
position, and now having no more occasion for Disguises,
she resolv'd to seem nothing but what really she was, a
wild untam'd Colt, perfectly loose, and careless to con-
ceal any Part, no, not the worst of her Conduct.
She carry'd on this Air of Levity to such an Excess,
that I could not but be dissatisfy'd at the Expence of it,
for she kept Company that I did not like, liv'd beyond
what I could support, and sometimes lost at Play more
that I car'd to pay: Upon which, one Day, I took Occa-
sion to mention it, but lightly; and said to her, by way of
Raillery, that we liv'd merrily, for as long as it would last;
she turn'd short upon me, what do ye mean, says she,
why, you don't pretend to be uneasy, do ye? No, no, Ma-
dam, not I, by no Means, 'tis no Business of mine you
know, said I, to enquire what my Wife spends, or whe-
ther she spends more than I can afford, or less, I only de-
sire the Favour to know, as near as you can guess, how
long you will please to take to dispatch me, for I would
not be too long a dying.
I don't know what you talk of, says she, you may die
as leisurely, or as hastily as you please, when your Time
comes, I an't a going to kill you, as I know of.
But you are a going to starve me Madam, said he,
and Hunger is as leisurely a Death, as breaking upon
the Wheel.
I starve you, why are not you a great Virginia Mer-
chant, and did not I bring you i500 /. What would you
have? Sure, you can maintain a Wife out of that, can't
you?
Yes, Madam, says I, I could maintain a Wife, but not
a Gamester, tho' you had brought me i500 /. a Year, no
Estate is big enough for a Box and Dice.
She took Fire at that, and flew out in a Passion, and
after a great many bitter Words, told me in short, that
she saw no Occasion to alter her Conduct; and as for my
not maintaining her, when I could not maintain her long-
er, she would find some Way or other to maintain herself.
Sometime after the first Rattle of this Kind, she vouch-
safed to let me know that she was pleas'd to be with Child;
I was at first glad of it, in hopes it would help to abate her
Madness; but it was all one, and her being wtih Child,
only added to the rest, for she made such Preparations
for her Lying-inn, and the other Appendixes of a Child's
being born, that in short, I found she would be down-
right distracted; and I took the Liberty to tell her one
Day, that she would soon bring herself and me to De-
struction, and entreated her to consider that such Figures
as those were quite above us, and out of our Circle; and in
short, that I neither could, nor would allow such Ex-
pences, that at this Rate, two or three Children would ef-
fectually Ruin me, and that I desir'd her to consider what
she was doing.
She told me with an Air of Disdain, that it was none of
her Business to consider any Thing of that Matter, that
if I could not allow it, she would allow it herself, and I
might do my worst.
I begg'd her to consider Things for all that, and not
drive me to Extremities, that I married her to love and
cherish her, and use her as a good Wife ought to be us'd,
but not to be ruin'd, and undone by her. In a Word, no-
thing could molify her, nor any Argument persuade her
to Moderation, but withal took it so heinously, that I
should pretend to restrain her, that she told me in so many
Words, she would drop her Burthen with me, and then if
I did not like it, she would take Care of herself, she would
not live with me an Hour; for she would not be restrain'd,
not she, and talk'd a long while at that Rate.
I told her, as to her Child, which she call'd her Bur-
then, it should be no Burthen to me, as to the rest she
might do as she pleas'd; it might however do me this Fa-
vour, that I should have no more Lyings-Inn at the Rate
of 136 /. at a Time, as I found she intended it should be
now; she told me she could not tell that, if she had no .
more by me, she hop'd she should by some Body else; say
you so Madam, said I, then they that get them, shall keep
them: She did not know that neither, she said, and so
turn'd it off Jearing, and as it were Laughing at me.
Th1s last Discourse nettled me, I must confess, and the
more, because had a great deal of it, and very often, till in
short, we began at length to enter into a friendly Treaty
about parting.
Nothing cou'd be more Criminal than the several Dis-
courses we had upon this Subject; she demanded a separ-
ate Maintenance, and in particular at the Rate of 300 /. a
Year, and I demanded Security of her, that she should
not run me in Debt; she demanded the keeping of the
Child, with an Allowance of 100 /. a Year for that, and I
demanding that I should be secur'd from being charg'd
for keeping any she might have by some Boby else, as she
had threaten'd me.
In the Interval, and during these Contests, she drop'd
her Burthen, (as she call'd it) and brought me a Son, a
very fine Child.
She was content, during her Lying-Inn, to abate a lit-
tle, tho' it was but a very little indeed, of the great Ex-
pence she had intended ; and with some Difficulty and
Persuasion was content with a Suit of Child-bed Linnen
of 15/. instead of one she had intended of Threescore;
and this she magnified as a particular Testimony of her
Condescension, and a yielding to my avaricious Temper,
as she call'd it.
But after she was up again, it was the same Thing, and
she went on with her Humour to that Degree, that in a
little Time she began to carry it on to other Excesses, and
to have a sort of Fellows come to visit her, which I did not
like, and once in particular, staid Abroad all Night: The
next Day when she came Home, she began to cry out
first; told me where (as she said) she lay, and that the Oc-
casion was a Christening, where the Company had a
Feast, and staid too late; that if I was dissatisfied, I might
inform myself there of all the Particulars, where she lay,
and the like; I told her coldly, Madam, you do well to sug-
gest my being dissatisfied, for you may be sure I am, and
you cou'd expect no other; that as to going to your
Haunts to inform myself, that's not my Business; 'tis
your Business to bring Testimonies of your Behaviour,
and to prove where you lay, and in what Company, 'tis
enough to me that you lay out of your own House, with-
out your Husband's Knowledge or Consent, and before
you and I converse again, I must have some Satisfaction
of the Particulars.
She answer'd,with all her Heart, she was as indifferent
as I, and since I took so ill her lying at a Friend's House
on an extraordinary Occasion, she gave me to under-
stand, that it was what she would have me expect, and
what she would have the Liberty to do when she thought
fit.
Well Madam, said I, if I must expect what I cannot
allow, you must expect I shall shut my Doors by Day,
against those that keep out of them at Night.
She would try me, she said, very speedily, and if I shut
the Doors against her, she would find a Way to make me
open them.
Well Madam, says I, you threaten me hard, but I
would advise you to consider before you take such Mea-
sures, for I shall be as good as my Word: However, it was
not long that we cou'd live together upon these Terms;
for I found very quickly what Company she kept, and
that she took a Course which I ought not to bear; so I be-
gan the Separation first, and refused her my Bed: We had
indeed refrain'd all Converse as Husband and Wife for
about two Months before, for I told her very plainly, I
would Father no Brats that were not of my own getting;
and Matters coming thus gradually to an Extremity, too
great to continue as it was, she went off one Afternoon,
and left me a Line in Writing, signifying that Affairs
were come to such a Pass between us, that she did not
think fit to give me the Opportunity of shutting her out
of Doors, and that therefore she had retir'd herself to such
a Place; naming a Relation of her own, as scandalous as
herself; and that she hop'd I would not give her the Trou-
ble to sue for her Support, in the ordinary Course of Law,
but that as her Occasions requir'd, she should draw Bills
upon me, which she expefted I would not refuse.
I was extremely satisfied with this Proceeding, and
took Care to let her hear of it, tho' I gave no Answer at all
to her Letter, and as I had taken Care before, that when-
ever she play'd such a Prank as this, she should not be
able to carry much with her; so after she was gone, I im-
mediately broke up House-keeping, sold my Furniture
by publick Out-cry, and in it every Thing in particular
that was her own, and set a Bill upon my Door, giving her
to understand by it, that she had passed the Rubicon, that
as she had taken such a Step of her own Accord, so there
was no Room left her ever to think of coming back again.
This was what any one may believe I should not have
done, if I had seen any Room for a Reformation; but she
had given me such Testimonies of a Mind alienated from
her Husband in particular, espousing her own unsuffer-
able Lenity, that there was indeed no possibility of our
coming afterwards to any Terms again.
However, I kept a couple of trusty Agents so near her,
that I fail'd not to have a full Account of her Conduct,
tho' I never let her know any Thing of me, but that I was
gone over to France; as to her Bills which she said she
would draw upon me, she was as good as her Word in
drawing one of 30 /. which I refused to accept, and never
i6 The L i f e of Colonel Jack
It is true, and I must acknowledge it, that all this was
a very melancholy Scene of Life to me, and but that she
took Care by carrying herself to the last Degree provok-
ing, and continually to insult me, I could never have
gone on to the parting with so much Resolution, for I
really lov'd her very sincerely, and could have been any
Thing but a Beggar and a Cuckold with her, but those
were intollerable to me, especially, as they were put upon
me with so much insult and rudeness.
But my Wife carried it at last to a Point that made all
Things light and easy to me, for after above a Years Sepa-
ration, and keeping such Company as she thought fit, she
was pleased to be with Child again, in which she had,
however, so much Honesty, as not to pretend that she
had had any Thing to do with me; what a wretched Life
she led after this, and how she brought herself to the ut-
most Extremity of Misery and Distress, I may speak of
hereafter.
I had found soon after our parting, that I had a great
deal of Reason to put myself into a Posture at first, not to
be imposed upon by her; for I found very quickly that
she had run herself into Debt in several Places very con-
siderably; and that it was upon a Supposition, that I was
liable to those Debts: But I was gone, and it was absolute-
ly necessary I should do so; upon which, she found herself
oblig'd out of her wicked Gains, however, whatever she
made of them to discharge most those Debts herself.
As soon as she was deliver'd of her Child, in which my
Intelligence was so good, that I had gotten sufficient
Proof of it; I sued her in the Ecclesiastical Court, in order
to obtain a Divorce, and as she found it impossible to
avoid it, so she declin'd the Defence, and I gain'd a legal
Decree, or what they call it, of Divorce, in the usual Time
of such Process, and now I thought myself a Freeman
once again, and began to be sick of Wedlock with all my
Heart.
I liv'd retir'd, because I knew she had contracted
Debts which I should be oblig'd to pay, and I was resolv'd
to be gone out of her Reach, with what Speed I could,
but it was necessary that I should stay till the Virginia
Fleet came in; because I look'd for at least 300 Hogs-
heads of Tobacco from thence, which I knew would heal
all my Breaches; for indeed the Extravagance of 3 Years
vol. ii c
with this Lady, had sunk me most effectually, even far
beyond her own Fortune, which was considerable, tho'
not quite i500 /. as she had call'd it.
But all the Mischiefs I met with on Account of this
Match, were not over yet, for when I had been parted
with her about three Months, and had refused to accept
her Bill of 30 /. which I mention'd above, tho' I was re-
mov'd from my first Lodgings too, and thought I had ef-
fectually secur'd myself from being found out, yet there
came a Gentleman well dressed to my Lodgings one Day,
and was let in before I knew of it, or else I should scarce
have admitted him.
He was led into a Parlour, and I came down to him in
my Gown and Slippers; when I came into the Room, he
call'd me as familiarly by my Name, as if he had known
me 20 Year, and pulling out a Pocket-Book, he shows me
a Bill upon me, drawn by my Wife, which was the same
Bill for 30 /. that I had refused before.
Sir, says I, this Bill has been presented before, and I
gave my Answer to it then.
Answer! Sir, says he, with a kind of jeering taunting
Air, I don't understand what you mean by an Answer, it
is not a Question Sir, it is a Bill to be paid.
Well Sir, says I, it is a Bill I know that, and I gave my
Answer to it before.
Sir, Sir, says he, very saucily, your Answer! there's no
Answer to a Bill, it must be paid, Bills are to be paid, not
to be answered, they say you are a Merchant Sir, Mer-
chants always pay their Bills.
I begun to be angry too a little, but I did not like my
Man, for I found he began to be quarrelsome; however I
said, Sir, I perceive you are not much used to presenting
Bills; Sir, a Bill is always first presented, and presenting is
a Question, 'tis asking if I will accept, or pay the Bill, and
then whether I say yes or no, 'tis an Answer one Way or
other; after 'tis accepted, it indeed requires no more An-
swer but Payment when 'tis due, if you please to inform
yourself, this is the Usage which all Merchants or Trades-
men of any kind, who have Bills drawn upon them act by.
Well Sir, says he, and what then? What is this to the
paying me the 30 /.
Why Sir, says I, it is this to it, that I told the Person
that brought it, I should not pay it.
Not pay it! says he, but you shall pay it, ay, ay, you will
pay it.
She that draws it, has no Reason to draw any Bills up-
on me, I am sure, said I, and I shall pay no Bills she draws
I assure you.
Upon this, he turns short upon me, Sir, she that draws
this Bill is a Person of too much Honour to draw any Bill
without Reason, and 'tis an Affront to say so of her, and I
shall expect Satisfaction of you for that by itself; but first
the Bill Sir, the Bill, you must pay the Bill Sir.
I return'd as short, Sir, I affront no body. I know the
Person as well as you I hope, and what I have said of her
is no Affront, she can have no Reason to draw Bills upon
me, for I owe her nothing.
I omit intermingling the Oaths he lac'd his Speech
with, as too foul for my Paper, but he told me he would
make me know she had Friends to stand by her, that I
had abused her, and he would let me know it, and do her
Justice; but first, I must pay his Bill.
I answer'd in short, I would not pay the Bill, nor any
Bills she should draw.
With that he steps to the Door and shuts it, and swore
by G—d he would make me pay the Bill before we part-
ed, and laid his Hand upon his Sword, but did not draw it
out.
I confess I was frighted to the last Degree, for I had no
Sword, and if I had, I must own, that tho' I had learn'd a
great many good Things in France to make me look like a
Gentleman, I had forgot the main Article of learning how
to use a Sword, a Thing so universally practised there;
and to say more, I had been perfectly unacquainted with
Quarrels of this Nature; so that I was perfectly surprised
when he shut the Door, and knew not what to say or do.
However as it happen'd,the People of the Househear-
ing us pretty loud, came near the Door, and made a Noise
in the Entry, to let me know they were at Hand, and one
of the Servants going to open the Door, and finding it
lock'd, call'd out to me, Sir, for God's Sake open the
Door! What is the Matter? Shall we fetch a Constable? I
made no Answer, but it gave me Courage, so I sat down
composed in one of the Chairs, and said to him; Sir, this
is not the Way to make me pay the Bill, you had much
better be easy, and take your Satisfaction another Way.
He understood me of fighting, which upon my Word
was not in my Thoughts, but I meant that he had better
take his Course at Law.
With all my Heart, says he, they say you are a Gentle-
man, and they call you Colonel; now if you are a Gentle-
man, I accept your Challenge Sir, and if you will walk
out with me, I'll take it for full Payment of the Bill, and
will decide it as Gentlemen ought to do.
I challenge you Sir! said I, not I, I made no Chal-
lenge, I said, this is not the Way to make me pay a Bill
that I have not accepted, that is, that you had better seek
your Satisfaction at Law.
Law! says he, Law! Gentleman's Law is my Law; in
short Sir, you shall pay me or fight me, and then, as if he
had mistaken, he turns short upon me, nay, says he, you
shall both fight me and pay me, for I will maintain her
Honour; and in saying this he bestowed about 6 or 7
Damme's and Oaths, by Way of Parenthesis.
This Interval deliver'd me effectually, for just as the
Word fight me, for I will maintain her Honour, the Maid
had brought in a Constable, with 3 or 4 Neighbours to as-
sist him.
He heard them come in, and began to be a little in a
Rage, and asked him if I intended to mob him instead of
paying, and laying his Hand on his Sword, told me, if
any Man offered to break in upon him, he would run me
thro' the first Moment, that he might have the fewer to
deal with afterwards.
I told him he knew I had call'd for no Help, believing
he could not be in earnest in what he had said, and that if -
any Body attempted to come in upon us, it was to prevent
the Mischief he threaten'd, and which he might see I had
no Weapons to resist.
Upon this the Constable call'd, and charg'd us both in
the King's Name to open the Door, I was sitting in a
Chair, and offer'd to rise, he made a Motion as if he would
draw, upon which I sat down again, and the Door not be-
ing open'd, the Constable set his Foot against it and came
in.
Well Sir, says my Gentleman, and what now? What's
your Business here? Nay Sir, says the Constable, you see
my Business, I am a Peace Officer, all I have to do is to
keep the Peace, and I find, the People of the House fright-
ed for Fear of Mischief should be between you, have
fetch'd me to prevent it; what Mischief have they sup-
posed you should find, says he, I suppose, says the Con-
stable, they were afraid you shou'd fight; that's because
they did not know this Fellow here, he never fights, they
call him Colonel, says he, I suppose he might be born a
Colonel, for I dare say, he was born a Coward; he never
fights, he dares not see a Man, if he would have fought he
would have walk'd out with me, but he scorns to be brave,
they would never have talk'd to you of fighting, if they
had known him: I tell you Mr. Constable he is a Coward,
and a Coward is a Rascal; and with that he came to me,
and strok'd his Finger down my Nose pretty hard, and
laugh'd and mock'd most horridly, as if I was a Coward;
now for ought I knew it might be true, but I was now
what they call a Coward made desperate, which is one of
the worst of Men in the World to encounter with, for be-
ing in a Fury, I threw my Head in his Face, and closing
with him, threw him fairly on his Back by main Strength,
and had not the Constable step'd in and taken me off, I
had certainly stamp'd him to Death with my Feet, for my
Blood was now all in a Flame, and the People of the House
were frighted now as much the other Way, least I should
kill him, tho' I had no Weapon at all in my Hand.
The Constable too reprov'd me in his Turn, but I said
to him, Mr. Constable, don't you think I am sufficiently
provok'd? Can any Man bear such Things as these? I de-
sire to know who this Man is, and who sent him hither?
I am, says he, a Gentleman, and come with a Bill to him
for Money, and he refuses to pay it; well, says the Con-
stable very prudently, that's none of my Business, I am
no Justice of Peace to hear the Cause, be that among your
selves, but keep your Hands off of one another, and that's
as much as I desire; and therefore Sir, says the Constable
to him, if I may advise you, seeing he will not pay the
Bill, and that must be decided between you as the Law
directs, I would have you leave it for the present, and go
quietly away.
He made many impertinent Harangues about the Bill,
and insisted, that it was drawn by my own Wife; I said
angrily, then it was drawn by a Whore, he bullied me up-
on that, told me I durst not tell him so any where else; so
I answer'd, I would very soon publish her for a Whore to
all the World, and cry her down, and thus we scolded for
near half an Hour, for I took Courage when the Con-
stable was there, for I knew that he would keep us from
fighting, which indeed I had no Mind too, and so at
length I got rid of him.
I was heartily vex'd at this Rencounter, and the more,
because I had been found out in my Lodging, which I
thought I had effectually conceal'd; however I resolv'd
to remove the next Day, and in the mean Time I kept
within Doors all that Day till the Evening, and then I
went out in order not to return thither any more.
Being come out into Grace-cburcb-Sfreet, I observ'd a
Man follow me, with one of his Legs tied up in a String,
and hopping along with the other, and two Crutches; he
begg'd for a Farthing, but I enclining not to give him any
Thing, the Fellow follow'd me still, till I came to a Court,
when I answer'd hastily to him, I have not for you? Pray
don't be so troublesome, with which Words he knock'd
me down with his Crutches.
Being stunn'd with the Blow, I knew nothing what
was done to me afterwards; but coming to myself again, I
found I was wounded very frightfully in several Places,
and that among the rest my Nose was slit upwards, one
of my Ears almost cut off, and a great Cut with a Sword
on the Side of the Forehead, also a Stab into the Body,
tho' not dangerous.
Who had been near me, or struck me, besides the
Cripple that struck me with his Crutch I knew not, nor
do I know to this Hour, but I was terribly wounded, and
lay bleeding on the Ground sometime, till coming to my-
self I got Strength to cry out for Help, and People com-
ing about me, I got some Hands to carry me to my Lodg-
ing, where I lay by it more than two Months before I was
well enough to go out of Doors, and when I did go out,
I had Reason to believe that I was waited for by some
Rogues,who watch'd an Opportunity to repeat the Injury
I had met with before.
This made me very uneasy, and I resolv'd to get my-
self out of Danger if possible, and to go over to France, or
Home, as I call'd it, to Virginia; so to be out of the Way of
Villains and Assassinations, for every Time I stirr'd out
here, I thought I went in Danger of my Life, and therefore,
as before I went out at Night thinking to be conceal'd, so
now I never went out but in open Day, that I might be
safe, and never without one or two Servants to be myLife-
Guard.
But I must do my Wife a Piece of Justice here too, and
that was, that hearing of what had befallen me, she wrote
me a Letter, in which she treated me more decently than
she had been wont to do, said she was very sorry to hear
how I had been used, and the rather because she under-
stood it was on presenting her Bill to me; she said she
hop'd I could not in my worst Dispositions think so hard-
ly of her, as to believe it was done by her Knowledge or
Consent, much less by her Order or Direction; that she
abhorr'd such Things, and protested if she had the least
Knowledge, or so much as a Guess at the Villains con-
cern'd she would discover them to me; she let me know
the Person's Name to whom she gave the Bill, and where
he liv'd, and left it to me to oblige him to discover the
Person who had brought it, and used me so ill, and wish'd
I might find him, and bring him to Justice, and have him
punish'd with the utmost Severity of the Law.
I took this so kindly of my Wife, that I think in my
Conscience, had she come after it herself, to see how I
did, I had certainly taken her again; but she satisfied her-
self with the Civility of another Letter, and desiring me
to let her know as often as I could how I was, adding,
that it would be infinitely to her Satisfaction, to hear I
was recover'd of the Hurt I had receiv'd, and that he was
hang'd at Tyburn who had done it.
She used some Expressions, signifying as I under-
stood them, her Affliction at our parting, and her con-
tinu'd Respect for me, but did not make any Motion to-
wards returning; then she used some Arguments to move
me to pay her Bills, intimating that she had brought me a
large Fortune, and now had nothing to subsist, which
was very severe.
I wrote her an Answer to this Letter, tho'I had not to
the other, letting her know how I had been used, that I
was satisfied upon her Letter, that she had no Hand in it,
that it was not in her Nature to treat me so, who had never
injur'd her, used any Violence with her, or been the Cause
or Desire of our Parting; that as to her Bill, she could not
but know how much her expensive Way of living had
straitn'd and reduc'd me, and would if continu'd have
ruin'd me, that she had in less than 3 Years spent more
than as much as she brought to me, and would not abate
her expensive Way, tho' calmly intreated by me, with
Protestations, that I could not Support so great an Ex-
pence, but chose rather to break up her Family and go
from me, than to restrain herself to reasonable Limits,
tho' I used no Violence with her, but Entreaties, and
earnest Perswasions, back'd with good Reason; letting
her know how my Estate was, and convincing her that it
must reduce us to Poverty at least; that however, if she
would recall her Bill I would send her 30 /. which was the
Sum mention'd in her Bill, and according to my Ability
would not let her want, if she pleased to live within due
Bounds; but then I let her know also, that I had a very
bad Account of her Conduct, and that she kept Com-
pany with a scandalous Fellow, who I nam'd to her; that
I was loth to believe such Things of her, but that to put
an entire End to the Report, and restore her Reputation,
I let her know that still after all I had heard, if she would
resolve to live without Restraints, within the reasonable
Bounds of my Capacity, and treat me with the same Kind-
ness, Affection, and Tenderness, as I always had treated
her, and ever would: I was willing to receive her again,
and would forget all that was past; but that if she declin'd
me now, it wou'd be for ever, for if she did not accept my
Offer, I was resolv'd to stay here no longer, where I had
been so ill treated on many Occasions, but was preparing
to go into my own Country, where I would spend my
Days in quiet, and in a Retreat from the World.
She did not give such an Answer to this as I expected;
for tho' she thank'd me for the 30 /. yet she insisted upon
her Justification in all other Points, and tho' she did not
refuse to return to me, yet she did not say she accepted it,
and in short, said little or nothing to it, only a kind of
Claim to a Reparation of her injur'd Reputation and the
like.
This gave me some Surprize at first, for I thought in-
deed, any Woman in her Circumstances would have been
very willing to have put an End to all her Miseries, and
to the Reproach which was upon her, by a Reconciliation;
especially considering, she subsisted at that Time but
very meanly: But there was a particular Reason which
prevented her Return, and which she cou'd not plead to
in her Letter, yet was a good Reason against accepting an
Offer, which she would otherwise have been glad of, and
this was that as I have mention'd above, she had fallen in-
to bad Company, and had prostituted her Vertue to some
of her Flatterers, and in short, was with Child; so that she
durst not venture to accept my Offer.
However, as I observ'd above, she did not absolutely
refuse it, intending (as I understood afterward) to keep
the Treaty of it on Foot, till she could drop her Burthen,
as she call'd it before; and having been deliver'd private-
ly, have accepted my Proposal afterward; and indeed this
was the most prudent Step she cou'd take, or, as we may
say, the only Step she had left to take: But I was too many
for her here too, my Intelligence about her was too good
for her to conceal such an Affair from me, unless she had
gone away before she was visibly big, and unless she had
gone farther off too than she did, for I had an Account to
a Tittle, of the Time when, and Place where, and the
Creature of which she was deliver'd, and then my Offers
of taking her again were at an End, tho' she wrote me
several penitent Letters, acknowledging her Crime, and
begging me to forgive her; but my Spirit was above all
that now, nor cou'd I ever bear the Thoughts of her after
that, but pursued a Divorce, and accordingly obtain'd it,
as I have mention'd already.
Thi ngs being at this pass, I resolv'd (as I have observ'd
above) to go over to France, after I had receiv'd my Ef-
fects from Virginia, and accordingly I came to Dunkirk in
the Year and here I fell into Company with some
Irish Officers of the Regiment of Dillon, who by little and
little enter'd me into the Army, and by the Help of Lieu-
tenant General an Irishman, and some Money, I ob-
tain'd a Company in his Regiment, and so went into the
Army directly.
I was exceedingly pleased with my new Circumstances,
and now I used to say to myself, I was come to what I was
born to, and that I had never till now liv'd the Life of a
Gentleman.
Our Regiment, after I had been some Time in it, was
Commanded into Italy, and one of the most considerable
Actions that I was in, was the famous Attack upon Cre-
mona, in the Millanese, where the Germans being private-
ly, and by Treachery let into the Town in the Night,
thro' a kind of Common Shoar, surpriz'd the Town, and
got Possession of the greatest Part of it, surprizing the
Mareschal Duke de Villeroy, and taking him Prisoner as
he came out of his Quarters, and beating the few French
Troops which were left into the Citadel; but were in the
middle of their Victory so boldly and resolutely attack'd
by two Irish Regiments, who were quarter'd in the Street
leading to the River Po, and who kept Possession of the
Water-Gate, or Po Gate of the Town, by which the Ger-
man Reinforcements should have come in, that after a
most desperate Fight, the Germans had their Victory
wrung out of their Hands, and not being able to break
thro' us to let in their Friends, were oblig'd at length to
quit the Town again, to the eternal Honour of those Irish
Regiments, and indeed of their whole Nation, and for
which we had a very handsome Compliment from the
King of France.
I Nowhad the Satisfaction of knowing, and that for the
first Time too, that I was not that cowardly low spirited
Wretch that I was, when the Fellow bullied me in my
Lodgings, about the Bill of 30 /. had he attack'd me now,
tho' in the very same Condition, I should, naked and un-
arm'd as I was, have flewn in the Face of him, and tram-
pl'd him under my Feet; but Men never know them-
selves till they are tried, and Courage is acquir'd by Time
and Experience of Things.
Phillip de Comines tells us, that after the Battle of
Monteleri, the Count de Charlois, who till then had an utter
Aversion to the War, and abhorr'd it, and every Thing
that belong'd to it, was so chang'd by the Glory he ob-
tain'd in that Action, and by the Flattery of those about
him, that afterwards the Army was his Mistress, and the
Fatigues of the War his chief Delight; 'tis too great an
Example for me to bring in my own Case, but so it was,
that they flatter'd me so with my Bravery, as they call'd
it, on the Occasion of this Action, that I fancy'd myself
brave, whether I was so or not, and the Pride of it made
me bold and daring to the last Degree on all Occasions;
but what added to it was, that some Body gave a Particu-
lar Account to the Court of my being instrumental to the
saving the City, and the whole Cremonese, by my extra-
ordinary Defence of the Po Gate, and by my managing
that Defence after the Lieutenant Colonel, who com-
manded the Party where I was posted was kill'd; upon
which, the King sent me a publick Testimony of his ac-
cepting my Service, and sent me a Breviat to be a Lieu-
tenant-Colonel, and the next Courier brought me actually
a Commission for Lieutenant-Colonel in the Regiment
of .
I was in several Skirmishes and petty Encounters be-
fore this, by which I gain'd the Reputation of a good Offi-
cer, but I happen'd to be in some particular Posts too, by
which I got somewhat that I lik'd much better, and that
was a good deal of Money.
Our Regiment was sent from France to Italyby Sea, we
embark'd at Thoulon, and landed at Savona, in the Terri-
tory of Genoa, and marched from thence to the Dutchy of
Milan: At the first Town we were sent to take Possession
of, which was Alexandria, the Citizens rose upon our Men
in a most furious manner, and drove the whole Garrison,
which consisted of 800 Men, that is French, and Soldiers
in the French Service, quite out of Town.
I was quarter'd in a Burghers House, just by one of the
Ports, with 8 of my Men and a Servant, where calling a
short Council with my Men, we was resolved to main-
tain the House we was in,whatever it cost, till we received
Orders to quit it from the Commanding Officer; upon
this, when I saw our Men cou'd not stand their Ground
in the Street, being pressed hard by the Citizens, I turn'd
out of Doors all the Family, and kept the House as a Cas-
tle, which I was Governor in; and as the House join'd to
the City Gate, I resolv'd to maintain it, so as to be the last
that should quit the Place, my own Retreat being secur'd
by being so near the Port.
Having thus emptied the House of the Inhabitants,
we made no Scruple of filling our Pockets with whatever
we could find there, in a Word, we left nothing we could
carry away, among which, it came to my Lot to dip into
the Burgher's Cabinet, whose House it was where we
were, and there I took about the quantity of 200 Pistoles
in Money and Plate, and other Things of Value. There
was great Complaint made to Prince Vaudemont, who was
then Governor of the Millanese of this Violence; but as
the Repulse the Citizens gave us was contrary to his
Order, and to the general Design of the Prince, who was
then wholly in the Interest of King Philip, the Citizens
cou'd obtain nothing, and I found, that if we had plun-
der'd the whole City, it would have been the same Thing;
for the Governor had Orders to take our Regiment in,
and it was an Act of open Rebellion to resist us as they
did; however we had Orders not to fire upon the Bur-
ghers, unless constrain'd to it by evidently Necessity, and
we rather chose to quit the Place as we did, then dispute
it with a desperate Body of Fellows, who wanted no Ad-
vantage of us, except only that, of having Possession of
two Bastions, and one Port of our Retreat; first they were
treble our Number, for the Burghers being joined by 7
Companies of the regular Troops, made up above i600
Men besides Rabble, which was many more, whereas we
were about 800 in all; they also had the Citadel and seve-
ral Pieces of Cannon, so that we cou'd have made nothing
of it, if we had attack'd them; but they submitted 3 or 4
Days after to other Forces, the Soldiers within turning
upon them, and taking the Citadel from them.
After this, we lay still in Quarters 8 Months, for the
Prince having secur'd the whole Millanese for King Phil-
lip, and no Enemy appearing for some Time, had nothing
to do, but to receive the Auxiliar Troops of France; and
as they came, extend himself every Way as he cou'd, in
order to keep the Imperialists (who were preparing to
fall into Italy with a great Army) as much at a Distance as
possible, which he did, by taking Possession of the City
of Mantua, and of most of the Towns on that Side, as far
as the Lake De la Guarda, and the River Addige.
We lay in Mantua some Time, but were afterwards
drawn out by Order of the Count de Tesse, (afterwards
Marshal of France) to form the French Army till the Ar-
rival of the Duke de Vandosme, who was to Command in
Chief. Here we had a severe Campaign, Anno 1701. hav-
ing Prince Eugene of Savoy, and an Army of 40000 Ger-
mans, all old Soldiers to deal with, and tho' the French
Army was more numerous than the Enemy, by 2 5000
Men, yet being on the defensive, and having so many
Posts to cover, not knowing exactly where the Prince of
Savoy, who commanded the Imperial Army, would at-
tack us, it oblig'd the French to keep their Troops so di-
vided, and so remote from one another, that the Germans
push'd on their Design with great Success, as the His-
tories of those Times more fully relate.
I was at the Action at Carpi, July 1701, where we were
worsted by the Germans indeed, were forc'd to quit our
Encampment, and give up to the Prince the whole River
of Addige, and where our Regiment sustain'd some Loss,
but the Enemies got little by us, and Monsieur Catinate,
who Commanded at that Time, drew up in Order of Bat-
tle the next Day in Sight of the German Army, and gave
them a Defiance, but they would not stir, tho' we offer'd
them Battle two Days together, for having gain'd the
Passage over the Addige, by our quitting Rivo/i, which
was then useless to us, their Business was done.
Finding they declin'd a decisive Action, our Generals
pressed them in their Quarters, and made them fight for
every Inch of Ground they gained, and at length in the
September following, we attack'd them in their entrench'd
Posts of Chiar, here we broke into the very Heart of their
Camp, where we made a very terrible Slaughter, but I
know not by what Mistake among our Generals, or De-
fect in the Execution of their Orders, the Brigade of Nor-
mandy and our Irish Brigade, who had so bravely enter'd
the German Entrenchments, were not supported as we
should have been, so that we were oblig'd to sustain the
shock of the whole German Army, and at last to quit the
Advantage we had gain'd, and that not without Loss, but
being timely reinforced by a great Body of Horse, the
Enemy were in their Turn beaten off too, and driven
back into their very camp: The Germans boasted of hav-
ing a great Victory here, and indeed in repulsing us after
we had gain'd their Camp, they had the Advantage, but
had Monsieur de Tesse succoured us in Time, as old Ca-
tinat said he ought to have done, with i2000 Foot which
he had with him, that Days Action had put an End to the
War, and Prince Eugene must have been glad to have
gone back to Germany, in more Haste than he came, if
perhaps we had not cut him short by the Way.
But the Fate of Things went another Way, and the
Germans continu'd all that Campaign to push forward,
and advance one Post after another, till they beat us quite
out of the Millanese.
vol. ii d
The latter Part of this Campaign we made only a party
War, the French, according to their volatile Temper, be-
ing every Day abroad, either foraging or surprizing the
Enemy's Foragers, plundering or circumventing the
Plunders of the other Side, and that tho' they very often
come short Home; for the Germans had the better of
them on several Occasions, and indeed so many lost their
Lives upon those petty Encounters, that I think, includ-
ing those who died of Distempers gotten by hard Ser-
vice, and bad Quarters, lying in the Field even till the
Middle of December, among Rivers and Bogs, in a Coun-
try so full of Canals and Rivers, as that Part of Italy is
known to be, I say, we lost more Men, and so did the
Enemy also, than would have been lost in a general de-
cisive Battle.
The Duke of Savoy, to give him his due, press'd earn-
estly to put it to a Day, and come to a Battle with Prince
Eugene; but the Duke de Villeroy, Monsieur Catinate, and
the Count de Tesse, were all against it, and the principal
Reason was, that they knew the Weakness of the Troops,
who had suffer'd so much on so many Occasions, that
they were in no Condition to give Battle to the Germans;
so after, as I say, about three Months harrassing one an-
other with Parties, we went into Winter-Quarters.
Before we march'd out of the Field, our Regiment,
with a Detachment of Dragoons of 600, and about 250
Horse, went without a Design to intercept Prince Com-
mercy, a General of Note under Prince Eugene of Savoy\
the Detachment was intended to be only Horse and Dra-
goons, but because it was the Imperialists good Luck to
beat many of our Parties, and, as was given out, many
more than we beat of theirs; and because it was believed
that the Prince, who was an Officer of good Note among
them, would not go Abroad, but in very little Company,
the Irish Regiment of Foot was order'd to be added, that
if possible they might meet with their Match.
I was commanded about two Hours before, to pass
about 200 Foot, and 50 Dragoons, at a small Wood,
where our General had Intelligence that Prince would
post some Men, to secure his Passage, which according-
ly I did; but Count Tesse not thinking our Party strong
enough, had march'd himself with a Thousand Horse,
and 300 Grenadiers to support us, and it was very well he
did so; for Prince Commercy having Intelligence of the
first Party, came forward sooner than they expected, and
fell upon them, and had entirely routed them, had not the
Count, (hearing the firing) advanc'd with the Thousand
Horse he had with such Expedition, as to support his
Men in the very Heat of the Action, by which Means the
Germans were defeated, and forc'd to retire; but the
Prince made a pretty good Retreat, and after the Action,
came on to the Wood, where I was posted, but the Sur-
prize of his Defeat had prevented his sending a Detach-
ment to secure the Pass at the Wood, as he intended.
The Count de Tesse, understanding that we were sent
(as above) to the Wood, follow'd them close at the Heels,
to prevent our being cut off, and if it were possible that
we should give them any Check at the Wood, to fall in,
and have another Brush with them; it was near Night be-
fore they came to the Wood, by which Means they could
not discern our Number; but when they came up to the
Wood, 50 Dragoons advanc'd to discover the Pass, and
see if all was clear: These we suffer'd to pass a great Way
into the Defile, or Lane, that went thro' the Wood, and
then clapping in between them and the Entrance, cut off
their Retreat so effectually, that when they discover'd us,
and fir'd, they were instantly surrounded, and cut in
Pieces; the Officer who commanded them, and eight
Dragoons only being made Prisoners.
This made the Prince halt, not knowing what the Case
was, or how strong we were, and to get better Intelligence,
sent 200 Horse to surround or skirt the Wood, and beat
up our Quarter, and in the Interim, the Count de Tesse
appear'd in his Rear: We found the Strait he was in, by
the Noise of our own Troops at a Distance, so we resolv'd
to engage the 200 Horse immediately; accordingly our
little Troop of Horse drew up in the Entrance of the
Lane, and offer'd to skirmish, and our Foot lying behind
the Hedge, which went round the Wood, stood ready to
act as Occasion should offer, the Horse being attack'd,
gave Way, and retir'd into the Lane, but the Germans
were too old for us there, they contented themselves to
push us to the Entrance, but would not be drawn into a
narrow Pass without knowing whether the Hedges were
lin'd or no.
But the Prince finding the French in his Rear, and not
being strong enough to engage again, resolv'd to force
his Way thro', and commanded his Dragoons to a-light,
and enter the Wood, to clear the Hedges on either Side
the Lane, that he might pass with his Cavalry; this they
did so vigorously, and were so much too strongforus, that
tho' we made good our Ground a long Time, yet our Men
were almost half of them cut in Pieces. However, we gave
Time to the French Cavalry to come up, and to fall on the
Prince's Troops, and cut them off, and take a great many
Prisoners, and then retreated in our Turn, opening a
Gap for our own Horse to break in; 300 of the Dragoons
were kill'd, and 200 of them taken Prisoners.
In the first Heat of this Action, a German Officer of
Dragoons well follow'd, had knock'd down three Men
that stood next me, and offering me Quarter, I was ob-
lig'd to accept it, and gave him my Sword, for our Men
were upon the Point of quitting their Post, and shifting
every one as they could; but the Scale was turn'd, for our
Cavalry breaking in, (as above) the Dragoons went to
"Wreck, and the Officer who had me Prisoner, turning to
me said, We are alllosl; I asked him if I could serve him?
Stand slill a little, says he; for his Men fought most des-
perately indeed, but about 200 French Horse appearing
in his Rear too, he said to me in French, I will be your Pri-
soner, and returning me my Sword, gave me also his own;
a Dragoon that stood near him was just going to do the
like, when he was shot dead, and the Horse coming up,
the Field was cleared in an Instant; but Prince Commercy
went off with the rest of his Party, and was pursued no
farther.
There were 16 or 17 of our Men releas'd, as I was,
from being taken; but they had not the Luck I had, to
take the Officer that had them in keeping; he had been so
generous to me, as not to ask what Money I had about
me, tho' I had not much, if he had; but I lost by his Civil-
ity, for then I could not have the Assurance to ask him for
his Money, tho' I understood he had near a 100 Pistoles
about him; but he very handsomely at Night, when we
came to our Tents, made me a Present of 20 Pistoles, and
in Return, I obtain'd Leave for him to go to Prince
Eugene's Camp upon his Parole, which he did, and so got
himself exchang'd.
It was after this Campaign that I was quartered at Cre-
mona, when the Action happen'd there, of which I have
spoken already, and where our Irish Regiment did such
Service, that they sav'd the Town from being really sur-
priz'd, and indeed beat the Germans out again, after they
had been Masters of three Quarters of the Town six
Hours, and by which they gain'da very great Reputation.
But I hasten on to my own History, for I am not writ-
ing a Journal of the Wars, in which I had no long Share.
The Summer after this, our two Irish Regiments were
drawn out into the Field, and had many a sore Brush with
the Germans; for Prince Eugene, a vigilant General, gave
us little Rest, and gain'd many Advantages by his con-
tinual moving up and down, harrassing his own Men and
ours too; and whoever will do the French Justice, and
knew how they behaved, must acknowledge, they never
declin'd the Germans, but fought them upon all Occa-
sions, with the utmost Resolution and Courage; and tho'
it cost the Blood of an infinite Number of fine Gentlemen,
as well as private Soldiers, yet the Duke de Vendome, who
now commanded, tho' King Philip was himself in the
Army this Campaign, made the Prince of Savoy a full Re-
turn in his own Kind, and drove him from Post to Post,
till he was just at the Point of quitting the whole Country
of Italy; all that gallant Army Prince Eugene brought
with him into Italy, which was the best without doubt, for
the Goodness of the Troops, that ever were there, laid
their Bones in that Country, and many Thousands more
after them; till the Affairs of France declining in other
Places, they were forc'd in their Turn to give Way to
their Fate, as may be seen in the Histories of those Times
as above; but 'tis none of my Business.
The Part that I bore in these Affairs was but short and
sharp, we took the Field about the Beginning of July
1702, and the Duke de Vendome order'd the whole Army
to draw the sooner together in order to relieve the City of
Mantua, which was block'd up by the Imperialisls.
Pr1nce Eugene was a Politick, and indeed a fortunate
Prince, and had the Year before pushed our Army upon
many Occasions; but his good Fortune began to fail him
a little this Year, for our Army was not only more Nume-
rous than his, but the Duke was in the Field before him;
and as the Prince had held Mantua closely block'd up all
the Winter, the Duke resolved to relieve the Town, cost
what it would: As I said, the Duke was first in the Field,
the Prince was in no Condition to prevent his raising the
Blockade by Force; so he drew off his Troops, and leav-
ing several strong Bodies of Troops to protect Bersello,
which the Duke de Vendome threaten'd, and Borgofort,
where his Magazine lay, he drew all the rest of his Forces
together, to make Head against us; by this Time the
King of Spain was come into the Army, and the Duke de
Vendome lay, with about 3 5000 Men, near Luzara, which
he had resolv'd to attack, to bring Prince Eugene to a Bat-
tle : The Prince of Vaudemont lay entrench'd with 20000
more at Rivalto, behind Mantua, to cover the Frontiers of
Millan, and there was near 12000 in Mantua itself; and
Monsieur Pracontal lay with 10000 Men just under the
Cannon of one of the Forts, which guard the Causeway,
which leads into the City of Mantua: So that had all these
join'd, as they would have done in a few Days more, the
Prince must have been put to his Shifts, and would have
had enough to do, to have maintain'd himself in Italy; for
he was Master of no one Place in the Country, that could
have held out a formal Siege of fifteen Days open Tren-
ches, and he knew all this very well; and therefore, it
seems, while the Duke of Vendosme resolv'd, if possible,
to bring him to a Battle, and to that End, made Disposi-
tions to attack Luzara; we were surpriz'd to find the
15th of June, 1702, the whole Imperial Army appear'd
in Batalia, and in full March to attack us.
As it happen'd, our Army was all marching in Columns
towards them, as we had done for two Days before, and I
should have told you, that three Days before, the Duke
having Notice that General Visconti, with three Imperial
Regiments of Horse, and one of Dragoons, was posted at
San-Viftoria, on the Tessona; he resolv'd to attack them,
and this Design was carried so secretly, that while Mon-
sieur Visconti, tho' our Army was three Leagues another
Way, passing towards the Modenese, he found himself
unexpectedly attack'd by 6000 Horse and Dragoons of
the French Army: He defended himself very bravely, for
near an Hour; when being over-power'd, and finding he
should be forc'd into Disorder, he sounded a Retreat; but
the Squadrons had not fac'd about to make their Retreat,
scarce a Quarter of an Hour, when they found themselves
surrounded with a great Body of Infantry, who had en-
tirely cut off their Retreat, except over the Bridge of Tes-
sona, which being throng'd with their Baggage, they
could neither get backward or forward; so they thrush
and tumbled over one another, in such a Manner, that
they could preserve no kind of Order; but abundance fell
into the River, and were drowned, many were kill'd, and
more taken Prisoners; so that in a Word, the whole three
Regiments of Horse, and one of Dragoons, were entirely
defeated.
This was a great Blow to the Prince, because they were
some of the choicest Troops of his whole Army: We took
about 400 Prisoners, and all their Baggage, which was a
very considerable Booty, and about 800 Horses; and no
doubt these Troops were very much wanted in the Battle
that insued on the i5th, as I have said: Our Army being
in full March (as above) to attack Luzara, a Party of
Germans appear'd, being about 600 Horse, and in less
than an Hour more, their whole Army in order of
Battle.
Our Army form'd immediately, and the Duke posted
the Regiments as they came up, so much to their Advan-
tage, that Prince Eugene was oblig'd to alter his Disposi-
tions, and had this particular Inconvenience upon his
Hands, viz. to attack an Army superior to his own, in all
their most advantageous Posts; whereas had he thought
fit to have waited but one Day, we should have met him
half Way; but this was owing to the Pride of the German
Generals, and their being so opinionated of the Goodness
of their Troops: The Royal Army was posted with the
Left to the great River Po, on the other Side of which the
Prince of Vaudemonfs Army lay, canonading of the In-
trenchments which the Imperialisls had made at Borgo-
Fort, and hearing that there was like to be a general Bat-
tle, he detach'd i2 Battalions, and about i000 Horse, to
reinforce the Royal Army; all which, to our great En-
couragement, had Time to join the Army, while Prince
Eugene was making his new Dispositions for the Attack;
and yet it was the coming of these Troops which caus'd
Prince Eugene to resolve to begin the Fight, expecting to
have come to an Action before they cou'd come up, but
he was disappointed in the Reason of Fighting, and yet
was oblig'd to Fight too, which was an Error in the
Prince, that it was too late to retrieve.
It was Five o'Clock in the Evening before he could
bring up his whole Line to Engage; and then, after hav-
ing canonaded us to no great Purpose for half an Hour,
his Right, commanded by the Prince de Commercy, at-
tacked our left Wing with great Fury: Our Men receiv'd
them so well, and seconded one another so punctually,
that they were repulsed with a very great Slaughter, and
the Prince Commercy being (unhappily for them) kili'd in
the first Onset, the Regiments for want of Orders, and
surpriz'd with the Fall of so great a Man, were push'd in-
to Disorder, and one whole Brigade was entirely broke.
But their second Line advancing, under General Her-
beville, restor'd Things in the first; the Battalions rallied,
and they came boldly on to charge a second Time, and
being seconded, with new Reinforcements from their
main Body, our Men had their Turn, and were push'd to
a Canal, which lay on their left Flank, between them and
the Po, behind which they rallied, and being supported
by new Troops, as well Horse as Foot, they fought on
both Sides with the utmost Obstinacy, and with such
Courage and Skill, that it was not possible to judge who
should have had the better, could they have been able to
have fought it out.
On the Right of the Royal Army, was posted the Flo-
wer of the French Cavalry; namely, the Gens de Arms, the
Royal Carabineers, and the Queen's Horse-Guards, with
400 Horse more, and next them the Infantry, among
which were our Brigade; the Horse advanc'd first to
Charge, and they carried all before them Sword in Hand,
receiving the Fire of two Imperial Regiments of Curias-
sers, without firing a Shot, and falling in among them,
bore them down by the Strength of their Horses, putting
them into Confusion, and left so clear a Field for us to
follow, that the first Line of our Infantry stood drawn up
upon the Ground, which the Enemy at first possess'd.
In this first Attack the Marquis de Crequi, who com-
manded the whole Right Wing, was killed; a Loss,which
fully ballanc'd the Death of the Prince de Commercy, one
the Side of the Germans; after we had thus pushed the
Enemies Cavalry, (as above) their Troops, being rallied
by the Dexterity of their Generals, and supported by
three Imperial Regiments of Foot, they came on again to
the Charge with such Fury, that nothing could withstand
them; and here two Battalions of our Irish Regiments
were put into Disorder, and abundance of our Men kill'd;
and here also I had the Misfortune to receive a Musquet-
Shot, which broke my left Arm; and, that was not all, for
I was knock'd down by a Giant like a German Soldier,
who, when he thought he had kill'd me, set his Foot upon
me, but was immediately shot dead by one of my Men,
and fell just upon me, which, my Arm being broken, was
a very great Mischief to me; for the very Weight of the
Fellow, who was almost as big as a Horse, was such, that
I was not able to stir.
Our Men were beaten back after this, from the Place
where they stood, and so I was left in Possession of the
Enemy, but was not their Prisoner, (that is to say, was not
found) till next Morning, when a Party being sent, as
usual, with Surgeons to look after the wounded Men,
among the Dead, found me almost smothered with the
dead Germans, and others that lay near me; however, to
do them Justice, they us'd me with Humanity, and the
Surgeons set my Arm very skilfully, and well; and after
four or five Days, I had Liberty to go to Parma upon my
Parole.
Both the Armies continued fighting, especially on our
Left, till it was so dark, that it was impossible to know
who they fir'd at, or for the Generals to see what they did;
so they abated firing gradually, and as it may be truly said,
the Night parted them.
Both Sides claim'd the Victory, and both conceal'd
their Losses, as much as was possible; but 'tis certain,
that never Battle was fought with greater Bravery and
Obstinacy than this was, and had there been Day-light to
have fought it out, doubtless there would have been many
Thousand more Men kill'd on both Sides.
All the Germans had,to entitle them to the Victory was,
that they made our Left retire, as I have said,to the Canal,
and to the high Banks, or Mounds on the Edge of the
Po; but they had so much Advantage in the Retreat, they
fir'd from thence among the thickest of the Enemy, and
cou'd never be forc'd from their Posts.
The best Testimony the Royal Army had of the Vic-
tory, and which was certainly the better of the two, was,
that two Days after the Fight, they attack'd Guaflalia, as
it were in View of the German Army, and forc'd the Gari-
son to surrender, and to swear not to serve again for six
Months, which, they being 1500 Men, was a great Loss
to the Germans, and yet Prince Eugene did not offer to re-
lieve it; and after that we took several other Posts, which
the Imperialisls had Possession of, but were oblig'd to quit
them upon the Approach of the French Army, not being
in a Condition to fight another Battle that Year.
My Campaign was now at an End, and tho' I came
Lame off, I came off much better than abundance of
Gentlemen; for in that bloody Battle we had above 400
Officers kill'd or wounded, whereof three were General
Officers.
The Campaign held on till December, and the Duke de
Vendome took Borgo-Fort, and several other Places from
the Germans, who, in short lost Ground every Day in
Italy; I was a Prisoner a great while, and there being no
Chanel settled, Prince Eugene order'd the French Prison-
ers to be sent into Hungary, which was a Cruelty that
could not be reasonably exercised on them; however, a
great many, by that Banishment, found Means to make
their Escape to the Turks, by whom they were kindly re-
ceiv'd, and the French Ambassador at Conslantinople took
Care of them, and shipp'd them back again into Italy at
the King's Charge.
But the Duke de Vendome now took so many Germans
Prisoners, that Prince Eugene was tir'd of sending his
Prisoners to Hungary, and was oblig'd to be at the Charge
of bringing some of them back again, who he had sent
thither, and come to agree to a general Exchange of Pri-
soners.
I was, as I have said, allow'd for a Time to go to Parma,
upon my Parole, where I continu'd for the Recovery of
my Wound, and broken Arm, forty Days and was then
oblig'd to render myself to the commanding Officer at
Ferrara, where Prince Eugene coming soon after, I was,
with several other Prisoners of War, sent away into the
Milanese, to be kept for an Exchange of Prisoners.
It was in the City of Trent, that I continu'd about eight
Months, the Man, in whose House I quartered, was ex-
ceeding civil to me, and took a great deal of Care of me,
and I liv'd very easy; here I contracted a kind of Famili-
arity, perfectly undesign'd by me, with the Daughter of
the Burgher, at whose House I had lodg'd, and I know
not, by what Fatality that was upon me, I was prevail'd
with afterward to marry her: This was a Piece of Honesty
on my Side, which I must acknowledge, I never intended
to be guilty of; but the Girl was too cunning for me; for
she found Means to get some Wine into my Head more
than I us'd to drink, and tho' I was not so disorder'd with
it, but that I knew very well what I did, yet in an unusual
Height of good Humour, I consented to be Married.
This impolitick Piece of Honesty put me to many Incon-
veniences, for I knew not what to do with this new Clog,
which I had loaded myself with, I could neither stay with
her, or take her with me, so that I was exceedingly per-
plex'd.
The Time came soon after that I was releas'd by the
Chartel, and so was oblig'd to go to the Regiment, which
then was in Quarters in the Milanese, and from thence I
got Leave to go to Paris, upon my Promise to raise some
Recruits in England, for the Irish Regiments by the help
of my Correspondence there; having thus Leave to go to
Paris, I took a Passport from the Enemy's Army, to go to
Trent, and making a long Circuit, I went back thither,
and very honestly pack'd up my Baggage, Wife and all,
and brought her away thro' Tyrol, into Bavaria, and so
.thro' Suabia, and the black Foresl into Alsatia, from thence
I came into Lorrain, and so to Paris.
I had now a secret Design to quit the War, for I really
had enough of righting; but it was counted so dishonour-
able a Thing to quit, while the Army was in the Field,
*hat I could not dispense with it; but an intervening Acci-
dent made that Part easy to me: The War was now re-
newed between France, and England, and Holland, jusT: as
it was before; and the French King meditating nothing
more than how to give the English a Diversion, fitted out
a strong Squadron of Men of War and Frigates, at Dun-
kirk, on Board of which he embark'd a Body of Troops, of
about 6500 Men, besides Voluntiers; and the new King,
as we call'd him, tho' more generally he was call'd, the
Chevalier de St. George, was shipp'd along with them, and
all for Scotland.
I pretended a great deal of Zeal for this Service, and
that if I might be permitted to sell my Company in the
Irish Regiment I was in, and have the Chevalier's Brevet
for a Colonel, in Case of raising Troops for him in Great-
Britain, after his Arrival, I would embark Voluntier, and
serve at my own Expence; the latter gave me a great Ad-
vantage with the Chevalier; for now I was esteem'd as a
Man of Consideration, and one that must have a consid-
erable Interest in my own Country; so I obtain'd Leave
to sell my Company, and having had a good round Sum
of Money remitted me from London, by the Way of Hol-
land, I prepar'd a very handsome Equipage, and away I
went to Dunkirk to embark.
I was very well receiv'd by the Chevalier, and as he had
an Account that I was an Officer in the Irish Brigade, and
had serv'd in Italy, and consequently was an old Soldier;
all this added to the Character which I had before, and
made me have a great deal of Honour paid me, tho' at the
same Time I had no particular Attachment to his Person,
or to his Cause; norjindeed did I much consider the Cause,
of one Side or other, if I had, I should hardly have risqu'd,
not my Life only, but Effects too, which were all, as I
might say, from that Moment, forfeited to the English
Government, and was too evidently in their Power to con-
fiscate at their Pleasure.
However, having just receiv'd a Remittance from
London, of 300 /. Sterling, and sold my Company in the
Irish Regiment for very near as much, I was not only in-
sensibly drawn in, but was perfectly Voluntier in that
dull Cause, and away I went with them at all Hazards;
it belongs very little to my History to give an Account of
that fruitless Expedition, only to tell you, that being so
closely and effectually chas'd by the English Fleet, which
was superior in Force to the French, I may say, that in
escaping them, I escaped being hang'd.
It was the good Fortune of the French, that they over-
shot the Port they aim'd at, and intending for the Frith or
Forth, or as it is called, the Firth of Edinburgh, the first
Land they made was as far North as a Place call'd Mont-
rose, where it was not their Business to Land, and so they
were oblig'd to come back to the Frith, and were gotten
to the Entrance of it, and came to an Anchor for theTide;
but this Delay or Hinderance gave Time to the English,
under Sir George Bing, to come to the Frith, and they
came to an Anchor, just as we did, only waiting to go up
the Frith with the Flood.
Had we not over-shot the Port, as above, all our Squad-
ron had been destroy'd in two Days, and all we could have
done, had been to have gotten into the Peer or Haven at
Leith, with the smaller Frigates, and have landed the
Troops and Ammunition; but we must have set Fire to
the Men of War, for the English Squadron was not above
24 Hours behind us, or thereabout.
Upon this Surprize, the French Admiral set sail from
the North Point of the Firth, where we lay, and crowding
away to the North, got the Start of the English Fleet, and
made their Escape, with the Loss of one Ship only, which
being behind the rest, could not get away; when we were
satisfied the English left chasing us, which was not till the
third Night, when we alter'd our Course, and lost Sight
of them, we stood over to the Coast of Norway, and keep-
ing that Shore on Board all the Way to the Mouth of the
Baltick, we came to an Anchor again, and sent two Scouts
Abroad to learn News, to see if the Sea was clear, and
being satisfied that the Enemy did not chase us, we kept
on with an easier Sail, and came all back again to Dun-
kirk, and glad I was to set my Foot on Shore again; for all
the while we were thus flying for our Lives, I was under
the greatest Terror imaginable, and nothing but Halters
and Gibbets run in my Head, concluding, that if I had
been taken, I should certainly have been hang'd.
But the Care was now over, I took my Leave of the
Chevalier, and of the Army, and made haste to Paris: I
came so unexpectedly to Paris, and to my own Lodgings,
that it was my Misfortune to make a Discovery, relating
to my Wife, which was not at all to my Satisfaction; for I
found her Ladyship had kept some Company, that I had
Reason to believe were not such as an honest Woman
ought to have convers'd with, and as I knew her Temper,
by what I had found of her myself, I grew very jealous
and uneasy about her; I must own it touch'd me very near-
ly, for I began to have an extraordinary Value for her, and
her Behaviour was very taking, especially after I had
brought her into France; but having a Vein of Levity, it
was impossible to prevent her running into such Things,
in a Town, so full of what they call Gallantry as Paris.

It vext me also to think that it should be my Fate to be
a Cuckold, both Abroad and at Home, and sometimes I
would be in such a Rage about it, that I had no Govern-
ment of myself, when I thought of it; whole Days, and I
ay say sometimes whole Nights, I spent musing and
considering what I should do to her, and especially what
I should do to the Villain, wherever he was, that had thus
abus'd and supplanted me: Here indeed I committed
Murder more than once, or indeed than a hundred Times,
in my Imagination, and as the Devil is certainly an appa-
rent Prompter to Wickedness, if he is not the first Mover
of it in our Minds; he teiz'd me Night and Day with Pro-
posals to kill my Wife.
This horrid Project he carried up so high, by raising
fierce Thoughts, and fomenting the Blood upon my Con-
templation of the Word Cuckold, that in short, I left de-
bating whether I should Murder her or no, as a Thing out
of the Question, and determined; and my Thoughts were
then taken up only with the Management how I should
kill her, and how to make my Escape after I had done it.
All this while I had no sufficient Evidence of her Guilt,
neither had I so much as charg'd her with it, or let her
know I suspected her, otherwise than as she might per-
ceive it in my Conduct, and in the Change of my Behavi-
our to her, which was such, that she could not but per-
ceive that something troubled me, yet she took no Notice
of it to me, but receiv'd me very well, and shew'd herself
to be glad of my Return; nor did I find she had been ex-
travagant in her Expences while I was Abroad; but
Jealousy, as the wise Man says, is the Wrath of a Man; her
being so good a Hussy of what Money I had left her,
gave my distemper'd Fancy an Opinion that she had been
maintain'd by other People, and so had had no Occasion
to spend.
I must confess, she had a difficult Point here upon her,
tho' she had been really honest; for as my Head was pre-
possess'd of her Dishonesty, if she had been lavish, I
should have said, she had spent it upon her Gentlemen;
and as she had been frugal, I said, she had been main-
tain'd by them: Thus, I say, my Head was distemper'd, I
believ'd myself abus'd, and nothing could put it out of
my Thoughts Night or Day.
All this while, it was not visibly broken out between
us, but I was so fully possess'd with the Belief of it, that
I seem'd to want no Evidence, and I look'd with an evil
Eye upon every Body that came near her, or that she con-
vers'd with: There was an Officer of the Guards du Corps;
that lodg'd in the same House with us, a very honest
Gentleman, and a Man of Quality; I happen'd to be in a
little Drawing-Room, adjoining to a Parlour where my
Wife sat at that Time, and this Gentleman came into the
Parlour, which, as he was one of the Family, he might
have done without Offence, but he not knowing that I
was in the Drawing-Room, sat down and talk'd with my
Wife; I heard every Word they said, for the Door be-
tween us was open, nor could I say that there pass'd any
Thing between them, but cursory Discourse; they talk'd
of casual Things, of a young Lady, a Burgher's Daughter
of Nineteen, that had been Married the Week before to
an Advocate in the Parliament of Paris, vastly Rich, and
about 63; and of another, a Widow Lady of Fortune in
Paris, that had married her deceas'd Husband's Valet de
Chambre, and of such casual Matters, that I could find
no Fault with her now at all.
But it fill'd my Head with jealous Thoughts, and fir'd
my Temper: Now I fancy'd he us'd too much Freedom
with her, then that she us'd too much Freedom to him,
and once or twice I was upon the Point of breaking in up-
on them, and affronting them both, but I restrain'd my-
self; at length he talk'd something merrily of the Lady
throwing away her Maidenhead, as I understood it, upon
an old Man; but still it was nothing indecent; but I, who
was all on Fire already, could bear it no longer, but start-
ed up, and came into the Room, and catching at my Wife's
Words, Say you so, Madam, said I, was he too oldfor her?
And giving the Officer a Look, that I fancy was some-
thing a-kin to the Face on the Sign, call'd the Bull and
Mouth within Aldersgate, I went out into the Street.
The Marquis, so he was stil'd, a Man of Honour, and
of Spirit too, took it as I meant it, and follow'd me in a
Moment, and hem'd after me in the Street; upon which I
stopp'd, and he came up to me, Sir, said he, our Circum-
slances are very unhappy in France, that we cannot do our-
selves Juslice here, without the most severe Treatment in the
World; but come on it what will, you musl explain yourself to
me on the Subjecl of your Behaviourjusl now.
I was a little cool'd, as to the Point of my Conduct to
him in the very few Moments that had pass'd, and was
very sensible, that I was wrong to him, and I said there-
fore to him very frankly, Sir, you are a Gentleman, who I
know very well, and I have a very great Respect for you;
but I had been disturb'd a little about the Conduct of my
Wife, and were it your own Case, what would you have
done less?
I am sorry for any Dislike between you, and your Wife,
says he, but what is that to me? Can you charge me with
any Indecency to her, except my talking so and so, at
which he repeated the Words, and as I knew you were in
the next Room, and heard every Word, and that all the
Doors were open, I thought no Man could have taken
amiss so innocent an Expression.
I could no otherwise take it amiss, said I, than as I
thought it imply'd a farther Familiarity, and that you can-
not expect should be born by any Man of Honour; how-
ever, Sir, said I, I spoke only to my Wife, I said nothing
to you, but gave you my Hat as I pass'd you.
Yes, said he, and a Look as full of Rage as the Devil,
Are there no Words in such Looks?
I can say nothing to that, said I, for I cannot see my
own Countenance; but my Rage, as you call it, was at my
Wife, not at you.
But hark you Sir, said he, (growing warm as I grow
calm) your Anger at your Wife was for her Discourse
with me, and I think that concerns me too, and I ought to
resent it.
I think not Sir, said I, nor had I found you in Bed with
my Wife, would I have quarrel'd with you; for if my Wife
will let you lie with her, 'tis she is the Offender, what
have I to do with you? You could not lie with her if she
was not willing, and if she is willing to be a Whore, I
ought to punish her; but I should have no Quarrel with
you, I'll lie with your Wife if I can, and then I'm even
with you.
I spoke this all in good Humour, and in order to pacify
him, but it would not do; but he would have me give him
Satisfaction, as he call'd it, I told him I was a Stranger in
the Country, and perhaps should find little Mercy in
their Course of Justice; that it was not my Business to
fight any Man in his vindicating his keeping Company
with my Wife, for that the Injury was mine, in having a
bad Woman to deal with; that there was no Reason in the
Thing, that after any Man should have found the Way
into my Bed, I, who am injur'd, should go and stake my
Life upon an equal Hazard against the Men who have
abus'd me.
Nothing would prevail with this Person to be quiet for
all this; but I had affronted him, and no Satisfaction could
be made him, but that at the Point of the Sword; so we
agreed to go away together to Lisle in Flanders: I was
now Soldier enough not to be afraid to look a Man in the
Face, and as the Rage at my Wife inspir'd me with Cou-
rage, so he let fall a Word that fir'd and provok'd me be-
yond all Patience; for speaking of the Distrust I had of
my Wife, he said unless I had good Information, I ought
not to suspect my Wife: I told him, if I had good Informa-
tion, I should be past Suspicion; he replied, if he was
the happy Man that had so much of her Favour, he
would take Care then to put me past the Suspicion; I
gave him as rough an Answer as he could desire, and he
return'd in French, Nous Verrons aux Lisle, that is to say,
We will talk further of it at Lisle.
I told him, I did not see the Benefit either to himor me,
of going so far as Lisle to decide this Quarrel, since now I
perceiv'd he was the Man I wanted, that we might decide
this Quarrel aux Champ, upon the Spot, and whoever had
the Fortune to fell the other, might make his Escape to
Lisle, as well afterwards as before.
Thus we walk'd on, talking very ill-naturedly on both
Sides, and yet very mannerly, till we came clear of the
Subards of Paris, on the Way so Charenton; when seeing
the Way clear, I told him under those Trees was a very
fit Place for us, pointing to a Row of Trees adjoining to
Monsieur 's Garden Wall; so we went thither,
and fell to Work immediately, after some Fencing he
made a home Thrust at me, and run me into my Arm, a
long slaunting Wound, but at the same Time receiv'd
my Point into his Body, and soon after fell; he spoke some
Words before he dropp'd; first he told me I had kill'd
him, than he said, he had indeed wrong'd me, and as he
knew it, he ought not to have fought me; he desir'd I
would make my Escape immediately, which I did into
the City, but no farther, no Body as I thought having
seen us together: In the Afternoon, about six Hours after
the Action, Messengers brought News, one on the Heels
of another, that the Marquis was mortally wounded, and
carried into a House at Charenton; that Account, saying
he was not dead, surprized me a little, not doubting, but
that concluding I had made my Escape, he would own
who it was; however, I discovered nothing of my Con-
cern, but going up into my Chamber, I took out of a Cabi-
net there what Money I had, which indeed was so much
as I thought would be sufficient for my Expences; but
having an accepted Bill for 2000 Livres, I walk'd sedate-
ly to a Merchant who knew me, and got 50 Pistoles of
him upon my Bill, letting him know my Business call'd
me to England, and I would take the rest of him when he
had receiv'd it.
Having furnish'd myself thus, I provided me a Horse
for my Servant, for I had one very good one of my own,
and once more ventured Home to my Lodging, where I
heard again that the Marquis was not dead: My Wife all
this while cover'd her Concern for the Marquis so well,
that she gave me no Room to make any Remark upon
her; but she saw evidently the Marks of Rage and deep
Resentment in my Behaviour after some little Stay, and
perceiving me making Preparations for a Journey, she
said to me, Are you going out of Town? Yes Madam, say
I, that you may have Room to mourn for your Friend the
Marquis, at which she started, and shew'd she was indeed
in a most terrible Fright, and making a thousand Crosses
about herself, and with a great many Callings upon the
blessed Virgin, and her Country Saints, she burst out at
last, is it possible! Are you the Man that kill'd the Mar-
quis? Then you are undone and I too.
You may Madam, be a Loser by the Marquis being
kill'd, but I'll take Care to be as little a Looser by you as I
can; 'tis enough the Marquis has honestly confessed
your Guilt, and I have done with you; she would have
thrown herself into my Arms, protesting her Innocence,
and told me she would fly with me, and would convince
me of her Fidelity, by such Testimonies as I could not be
satisfied with, but I thrust her violently from me, Alle In-
fante! said I, go infamous Creature, and take from me the
Necessity I shou'd be under if I stay'd, of sending you to
keep Company with your dear Friend the Marquis. I
thrust her away with such Force, that she fell backward
upon the Floor, and cried out most terribly, and indeed
she had Reason, for she was very much hurt.
It grieved me indeed to have thrust her away with such
Force, but you must consider me now in the Circumstan-
ces of a Man enrag'd, and as it were out of himself, furi-
ous and mad: However, I took her up from the Floor,
and laid her on the Bed, and calling up her Maid, bid her
go and take Care of her Mistress; and going soon after
out of Doors, I took Horse, and made the best of my Way
not towards Calais or Dunkirk, or towards Flanders, whe-
ther it might be suggested I was fled, and whether they
did pursue me the same Evening; but I took the direct
Road for Lorrain, and riding all Night, and very hard, I
passed the Main the next Day at Night at Chalons, and
came safe into the Duke of Lorrain's Dominions the third
Day, where I rested one Day, only to consider what
Course to take, for it was still a most difficult Thing to
pass any Way, but that I should either be in the King of
France's Dominions, or be taken by the French Allies as a
Subject of France; but getting good Advice from a Priest
at Barle Duc, who, tho' I did not tell him the Particulars
of my Case, yet guessed how it was, it being as he said,
very usual for Gentlemen in my Circumstances to fly that
Way: Upon this Supposition, this kind Padre got me a
Church Pass, that is to say, he made me a Purveyor for
the Abbey of , and as such, got me a Passport to go
to Deux Ponts, which belonged to the King of Sweden.
Having such Authority there, and the Priest's Recom-
mendation to an Ecclesiastick in the Place, I got Pass-
ports from thence in the King of Sweden's Name to Co-
logne, and then I was thoroughly safe, so making my Way
to the Netherlands, without any Difficulty I came to the
Hague, and from thence, tho' very privately, and by seve-
ral Names, I came to England: And thus I got clear of my
Italian Wife, Whore, I should have call'd her, for after I
had made her so myself, how should I expect any other
of her?
Being arriv'd at London, I wrote to my Friend at Paris,
but dated my Letter from the Hague, where I order'd
him to direct his Answers: The chief Business of my
writing was, to know if my Bill was paid him, to enquire
if any Pursuit was made after me, and what other News
he had about me, or my Wife, and particularly how it had
far'd with the Marquis.
I receiv'd an Answer in a few Days, importing that he
had receiv'd the Money on my Bill, which he was ready
to pay as I should direct, that the Marquis was not dead,
but said he, you have kill'd him another Way, for he has
lost his Commission in the Guards, which was worth to
him 20000 Livres, and he is yet a close Prisoner in the
Baslile; that Pursuit was order'd after me, upon Suspi-
cion, that they had followed me to Amiens, on the Road to
Dunkirk, and to Chaslean de Cambresis, on the Way to
Flanders; but missing me that Way, had given it over;
that the Marquis had been too well instructed to own that
he had fought with me, but said, that he was assaulted on
the Road, and unless I could be taken, he would take his
Trial and come off, for want of Proof, that my flying was
a Circumstance indeed that mov'd strongly against him,
because it was known that we had had some Words that
Day, and were seen to walk together; but that nothing
being prov'd on either Side, he would come off with the
Loss of his Commission, which, however, being very
rich, he could bear well enough.
As to my Wife he wrote me Word she was inconsola-
ble, and had cry'd herself to Death almost; but he added,
(very ill-natur'd indeed) and whether it was for me, or
for the Marquis, that he could not determine: He like-
wise told me, she was in very bad Circumstances, and
very low, so that if I did not take some Care of her, she
would come to be in very great Distress.
The latter Part of this Story mov'd me indeed, for I
thought however it was, I ought not to let her starve; and
besides, Poverty was a Temptation which a Woman
could not easily withstand, and I ought not to be the In-
strument to drive her to a horrid Necessity of Crime, if I
could prevent it.
Upon this, I wrote to him again, to go to her, and talk
with her, and learn as much as he could of her particular
Circumstances; and that if he found she was really in
Want, and particularly, that she did not live a scandalous
Life, he should give her 20 Pistoles, and tell her, if she
would engage to live retir'd and honestly, she should have
so much annually, which was enough to subsist her.
She took the first 20 Pistoles, but bad him tell me, that
I had wrong'd her, and unjustly charg'd her, and I ought
to do her Justice; and I had ruin'd her by exposing her in
such a Manner as I had, having no Proof of my Charge, or
Ground for any Suspicion; that as to 20 Pistoles a Year,
it was a mean Allowance, to a Wife that had travelled
over the World, as she had done with me, and the like;
and so expostulated with him to obtain 40 Pistoles a Year
of me, which I consented to; but she never gave me the
Trouble of paying above one Year, for after that, the
Marquis was so fond of her again that he took her away
to himself; and as my Friend wrote me Word, had settled
400 Crowns a Year on her, and I never heard any more
of her.
I was now in London, but was oblig'd to be very retir'd,
and change my Name, letting no Body in the Nation
know who I was, except my Merchant, by whom I corre-
sponded with my People in Virginia, and particularly
that my Tutor, who was now become the Head Manager
of my Affairs, and was in very good Circumstances him-
self also by my Means; but he deserved all I did, or cou'd
do for him; for he was a most faithful Friend as well as
Servant, as ever Man had, in that Country at least.
I was not the easiest Man alive, in the retir'd solitary
manner I now liv'd in; and I experienc'd the Truth of the
Text, That it is not good for Man to be alone, for I was ex-
treamly melancholy and heavy, and indeed knew not
what to do with myself, particularly, because I was under
some Restraint, that I was too afraid to go abroad, at last
I resolv'd to go quite away, and go to Virginia again, and
there live retired as I could.
But when I came to consider that Part more narrowly,
I could not prevail with myself to live a private Life: I
had got a wandring kind of Taste and Knowledge of
Things, begat a Desire of encreasing it, and an exceeding
Delight I had in it, tho' I had nothing to do in the Armies
or in War, and did not design ever to meddle with k
again; yet I could not live in the World, and not enquire
what was doing in it, nor could I think of living in Vir-
ginia, where I was to hear my News twice a Year, and
read the publick Accounts of what was just then upon
the Stocks, as the History of Things past.
This was my Notion, I was now in my Native Country,
where my Circumstances were easy, and tho' I had ill
Luck Abroad, for I brought little Home with me, yet by
little good Management I might soon have Money by
me. I had no Body to keep but myself and my Plantations
in Virginia, generally return'd me from 400 to 600 /. a
Year, one Year above 700 /. and to go thither I concluded,
was to be buried alive; so I put off all Thoughts of it, and
resolv'd to settle somewhere in England, where I might
know every Body, and no Body know me. I was not long
in concluding where to pitch, for as I spoke the French
Tongue perfectly well, having been so many Years among
them, it was easy for me to pass for a Frenchman; so I
went to Canterbury, call'd myself an Englishman among
the French, and a Frenchman among the English; and on
that Score was the more perfectly conceal'd, going by the
Name of Monsieur Charnot, with the French, was call'd
Mr. Charnock among the English.
Here indeed I liv'd perfectly Incog. I made no particu-
lar Acquaintance so as to be intimate, and yet I knew
every Body, and every Body knew me, I discoursed in
common, talk'd French with the Walloons, and English
with the English; and liv'd retir'd and sober, was well
enough receiv'd by all Sorts, but as I meddled with no
Bodies Business, so no Body meddl'd with mine, I thought
I liv'd pretty well.
But I was not fully satisfied, a settled Family Life was
the Thing I lov'd, had made two pushes at it, as you have
heard, but with ill Success; yet the Miscarriage of what
was pass'd did not discourage me at all, but I resolv'd to
marry, I look'd out for a Woman as suitable as I could,
but always found something or other to shock my Fancy;
except once a Gentleman's Daughter of good Fashion,
but I met with so many Repulses of one kind or another,
that I was forc'd to give it over, and indeed, tho' I might
be said to be a Lover in this Suit, and had manag'd myself
so well with the young Lady, that I had no difficulty left,
but what would soon have been adjusted, yet her Father
was so difficult, made so many Objections, was to Day not
pleased, one Way To-morrow another, that he would
stand by nothing that he himself had proposed, nor could
he be ever brought to be of the same Mind two Days to-
gether; so that we at last put an End to the Pretensions,
for she would not marry without her Father's Consent,
and I would not steal her, and so that Affair ended.
I cannot say but I was a little vex'd at the Disappoint-
ment of this, so I left the City of Canterbury, and went to
London in the Stage-Coach; here I had an odd Scene pre-
sented as ever happen'd of its kind.
There was in the Stage-Coach a young Woman and
her Maid, she was sitting in a very melancholly Posture,
for she was in the Coach before me,and sigh'd most dread-
fully all the Way, and whenever her Maid spoke to her,
she burst out into Tears; I was not long in the Coach with
her, but seeing she made such a dismal Figure, I offer'd
to comfort her a little, and enquired into the Occasion of
her Affliction, but she wou'd not speak a Word; but her
Maid with a Force of crying too, said her Master was
dead, at which Word the Lady burst out again into a Pas-
sion of crying, and between Mistress and Maid, this was
all I could get for the Morning part of that Day: When
we came to Dine, I offer'd the Lady, that seeing I sup-
posed, she would not dine with the Company, if she
would please to dine with me, I would dine in a separate
Room, for the rest of the Company were Foreigners:
Her Maid thank'd me in her Mistresses Name, but her
Mistress could eat nothing, and desir'd to be private.
Here however, I had some Discourse with the Maid,
by whom I learn'd that the Lady was Wife to a Captain
of a Ship, who was outward Bound to somewhere in the
Streights, I think it was to Zant and Venice, that being
gone no farther than the Downs, he was taken sick, and
after about i0 Days Illness had died at Deal, that his
Wife hearing of his Sickness, had gone to Deal to see
him, and had come but just Time enough to see him die,
had stay'd there to bury him, and was now coming to
London in a sad disconsolate Condition indeed.
I heartily pitied the young Gentlewoman indeed,
and said some Things to her in the Coach, to let her know
I did so, which she gave no Answer too, but in Civility,
now and then made a Bow, but never gave me the least
Opportunity to see her Face, or so much as to know whe-
ther she had a Face or no, much less to guess what Form
of a Face it was; it was Winter Time, and the Coach put
up at Rochetter, not going thro' in a Day, as was usual in
Summer; and a little before we came to Rochesler, I told
the Lady I understood she had eat nothing to Day, that
such a Course would but make her sick, and doing her
Harm, could do her deceased Husband no Good; and
therefore I entreated her, that as I was a Stranger, and only
offer'd a Civility to her, in order to abate her severely
afflicting herself, she would yield so far to Matters of
Ceremony, let us Sup together as Passengers, for as to
the Strangers, they did not seem to understand the Cus-
tom, or to desire it.
She bow'd, but gave no Answer, only after pressing
her by Arguments, which she could not deny was very
civil and kind; she return'd, she gave me Thanks, but she
could not eat: Well Madam, said I, do but sit down, tho,
you think you cannot eat, perhaps you may eat a Bit; in-
deed you must eat, or you will destroy yourself at this
Rate of Living, and upon the Road too: In a Word you
will be Sick indeed; I argued with her, the Maid put in,
and said, do Madam, pray try to divert yourself a little; I
pressed her again, and she bow'd to me very respectfully,
but still said no, and she could not eat; the Maid con-
tinu'd to importune her, and said, Dear Madam do, the
Gentleman is a civil Gentleman, pray Madam do, and
then turning to me said, my Mistress will Sir I hope, and
seem'd pleased, and indeed was so.
However, I went on to perswade her, and taking no
Notice of what her Maid said, that I was a civil Gentle-
man, I told her, I am a Stranger to you Madam, but if I
thought you were shy of me on anyAccount, as to Civility,
I will send my Supper up to you in your Chamber, and
stay below myself; she bow'd then to me twice, and
look'd up, which was the first Time, and said, she had no
Suspicion of that kind, that my Offer was so civil, that she
was as much ashamed to refuse it, as she should be
^ham'd to accept it, if she was where she was known;
that she thought I was not quite a Stranger to her, for she
had seen me before; that she would accept my Offer, so
far as to sit at Table, because I desir'd it, but she could
not promise me to eat, and that she hop'd I would take
the other as a Constraint upon her, in return to so much
Kindness.
She startled me, when she said she had seen me before,
for I had not the least Knowledge of her, nor did I re-
member so much as to have heard her Name; for I had
ask'd her Name of her Maid, and indeed it made me al-
most repent my Compliment; for it was many Ways es-
sential to me not to be known: However, I could not go
back, and besides, if I was known, it was essentially ne-
cessary to me to know who it was that knew me, and by
what Circumstances; so I went on with my Compliment.
We came to the Inn but just before it was dark, I offer-
ed to hand my Widow out of the Coach, and she could not
decline it, but tho' her Hoods were not then much over
her Face, yet being dark, I could see little of her then, I
waited on her then to the Stair-foot, and led her up the
Inn Stairs to a Dining-Room, which the Master of the
House offer'd to show us, as if for the whole Company:
but she declin'd going in there, and said, she desir'd ra-
ther to go directly to her Chamber, and turning to her
Maid, bad her speak to the Inn-keeper to show her her
Lodging-Room; so I waited on her to the Door, and
took my Leave, telling her I would expect her at Supper.
In order to treat her moderately well, and not extrava-
gantly, for I had no Thoughts of any Thing farther than
Civility, which was the Effectof meer Compassion, for the
Unhappiness of the most truly disconsolate Woman that
I ever met with: I say, in order to treat her handsomely,
but not extravagantly, I provided what the House afford-
ed, which was a couple of Partridges, and a very good
Dish of stew'd Oysters; they brought us up afterward, a
Neats Tongue and a Ham, that was almost cut quite
down, but we eat none of it, for the other was fully enough
for us both, and the Maid made her Supper of the Oysters
we had left, which were enough.
I mention this, because it should appear, I did not
treat her as a Person I was making any Court to, for I had
nothing of that in my Thoughts; but meerly in Pity to
the poor Woman, who I saw in a Circumstance that was
indeed very unhappy.
When I gave her Maid Notice that Supper was ready,
she fetch'd her Mistress, coming in before her with a
Candle in her Hand, and then it was that I saw her Face,
and being in her Disabille, she had no Hoods over her
Eyes, or Black upon her Head, when I was truly surpriz-
ed to see one of the most beautiful Faces upon Earth: I
vol. ii f
saluted her, and led her to the Fire-side, the Table tho'
spread, being too far from the Fire, the Weather being
cold.
She was now something sociable, tho' very grave, and
sigh'd often, on Account of her Circumstances; but she
so handsomely govern'd her Grief, yet so artfully made,
it mingled itself with all her Discourse, that it added ex-
ceedingly to her Behaviour, which was every Way most
exquitely genteel: I had a great deal of Discourse with
her, and upon many Subjects, and by Degrees took her
Name, that is to say, from herself, as I had done before
from her Maid, also the Place where she liv'd, viz. near
Rateliff, or rather Stepney, where I asked her Leave to pay
her a Visit, when she thought fit to admit Company,which
she seem'd to intimate would not be a great while.
It is a Subject too surfeiting to entertain People with
/ the Beauty of a Person they will never see; let it suffice to
tell them she was the most beautiful Creature of her Sex
that I ever saw before or since; and it cannot be wonder'd
if I was charm'd with her, the very first Moment I see her
Face, her Behaviour was likewise a Beauty in itself, and
was so extraordinary, that I cannot say I can describe it.
The next Day she was much more free than she was
the first Night, and I had so much Conversation, as to
enter into Particulars of Things on both Sides, also she
gave me Leave to come and see her House, which how-
ever, I did not do under a Fortnight, or thereabouts,
because I did not know how far she would dispense with
the Ceremony, which it was necessary to keep up at the
beginning of the Mourning.
However I came as a Man that had Business with her,
relating to the Ship her Husband was dead out of, and the
first Time I came was admitted, and in short, the first
Time I came I made Love to her, she receiv'd that Pro-
posal with Disdain, I cannot indeed say she treated me
with any Disrespect, but she said she abhorred the Offer,
and would hear no more of it.
How I came to make such a Proposal to her, I scarce
knew then, tho' it was very much my Intention from the
first.
In the mean Time I enquir'd into her Circumstances
and her Character, and heard nothing but what was very
agreeable of them both; and above all, I found she had
the Report of the best humoured Lady, and the best bred
of all that Part of the Town; and now I thought I had
found what I had so often wish'd for to make me happy,
and had twice miscarried in, and resolv'd not to miss her,
if it was possible to obtain her.
It came indeed a little into my Thoughts, that I was
a married Man, and had a second Wife alive, who tho'
she was false to me, and a Whore, yet I was not legally
divorc'd from her, and that she was my Wife for all that;
but I soon got over that Part, for first, as she was a Whore,
and the Marquis had confessed it to me, I was divorc'd
in Law, and I had a Power to put her away; but having
had the Misfortune of fighting a Duel, and being oblig'd
to quit the Country, I could not claim the legal Process
which was my Right, and therefore might conclude my-
self as much divorc'd as if it had been actually done, and
so that Scruple vanish'd.
I suffer'd now two Months to run without pressing
my Widow any more, only I had kept a strict Watch to
find if any one else pretended to her; at the End of two
Months I visited her again, when I found she receiv'd me
with more Freedom, and we had no more Sighs and Sobs
about the last Husband; and tho' she would not let me
press my former Proposal, so far as I thought I might
have done, yet I found I had Leave to come again, and it
was the Article of Decency which she stood upon as much
as any Thing, that I was not disagreeable to her, and that
my using her so handsomely upon the Road, had given
me a great Advantage in her Favour.
I went on gradually with her, and gave her Leave to
stand off for two Months more; but then I told her the
Matter of Decency, which was but a Ceremony, was not
to stand in Competition with the Matter of Affection;
and in short, I could not bear any longer Delay, but that
if she thought fit we might marry privately, and to cut the
Story short, as I did my Courtship, in about five Months
I got her in the Mind, and we were privately married,
and that with so very exact a Concealment, that her Maid
that was so instrumental in it, yet had no Knowledge of it
for near a Month more.
I was now not only in my Imagination, but in Reality
the most happy Creature in the World, as I was so infi-
nitely satisfied with, my Wife was indeed the best hu-
mour'd Woman in the World, a most accomplish'd beau-
tiful Creature indeed, perfectly well bred, and had not
one ill Quality about her, and this Happiness continu'd
without the least Interruption for about six Year.
But I that was to be the most unhappy Fellow alive in
the Article of Matrimony, had at last a Disappointment
of the worst sort, even here; I had three fine Children by
her, and in her Time of her lying-in with the last, she got
some Cold, that she did not in a long Time get off, and in
short, she grew very sickly: In being so continually ill and
out of Order, she very unhappily got a Habit of drinking
Cordials and hot Liquors, Drink, like the Devil, when it
gets Hold of any one, tho' but a little, it goes on by little
and little to their Destruction; so in my Wife, her Sto-
mach being weak and faint, she first took this Cordial,
then that, till in short she could not live without them,
and from a Drop to a Sup, from a Sup to a Dram, from a
Dram to a Glass, and so on to Two, till at last she took in
short, to what we call Drinking.
As I liken'd Drink to the Devil, in its gradual Posses-
sion of the Habits and Person, so it is yet more like the
Devil in its Encroachment on us, where it gets Hold of
our Senses; in short, my beautiful, good humour'd, mo-
dest, well bred Wife, grew a Beast, a Slave to strong Li-
quor, and would be drunk at her own Table, nay, in her
own Closet by herself, till instead of a well made, fine
Shape, she was as fat as an Hostess; her fine Face bloated
and blotch'd, had not so much as the Ruins of the most
beautiful Person alive, nothing remain'd but a good Eye,
that indeed she held to the last: In short, she lost her
Beauty, her Shape, her Manners, and at last her Virtue;
and giving herself up to Drinking, kill'd herself in about
a Year and half after she first began that cursed Trade, in
which Time she twice was exposed in the most scandal-
ous Manner with a Captain of a Ship, who like a Villain,
took the Advantage of her being in Drink, and not know-
ing what she did; but it had this unhappy Effect, that in-
stead of her being asham'd, and repenting of it when she
came to herself, it harden'd her in the Crime, and she
grew as void of Modesty at last as of Sobriety.
01 the Power of Intemperance! and how it encroaches
on the best Dispositions in the World; how it comes upon
us gradually and insensibly, and what dismal Effects it
works upon our Morals, changing the most virtuous,
regular, well instructed, and well inclined Tempers into
worse than brutal. That was a good Story, whether real
or invented, of the Devil tempting a young Man to mur-
der his Father, No, he said, that was unnatural; why then,
says the Devil, go and lie with your Mother; no, says he,
that's abominable; well then, says the Devil, if you will
do nothing else to oblige me, go and get drunk; ay, ay,
says the Fellow, I'll do that, so he went and made himself
drunk as a Swine, and when he was drunk he murder'd
his Father, and lay with his Mother.
Never was a Woman more virtuous, modest, chaste,
sober, she never so much as desir'd to drink any Thing
strong; it was with the greatest Entreaty that I could pre-
vail with her to drink a Glass or two of Wine, and rarely,
if ever, above one or two at a Time, even in Company she
had no Inclination to it; not an immodest Word ever
came out of her Mouth, nor would she surfer it in any one
else in her hearing,without Resentment and Abhorrence:
But upon that Weakness and Illness after her last Lying-
in as above, the Nurse pressed her whenever she found
herself faint and a sinking of her Spirits, to take this Cor-
dial, and that Dram, to keep up her Spirits, till it became
necessary even to keep her alive, and gradually encreased
to a Habit, so that it was no longer her Physick but her
Food; her Appetite sunk and went quite away, and she
eat little or nothing, but came at last to such a dreadful
Height, that as I have said, she would be drunk in her
own Dressing-Room by ii o'Clock in the Morning, and
in short at last was never sober.
In this Life of hellish Excess, as I have said, she lost all
that was before so valuable in her, and a Villain, if it be
proper to call a Man that was really a Gentleman by such
a Name, who was an intimate Acquaintance coming to
pretend a Visit to her, made her and her Maid so drunk
together, that he lay with them both, with the Mistress
the Maid being in the Room, and with the Maid, the
Mistress being in the Room; after which, he it seems
took the like Liberty with them both as often as he thought
fit, t'ill the Wench being with Child, discover'd it for her-
self and for her Mistress too. Let any one judge what was
my Case now, I that for 6 Years thought myself the hap-
piest Man alive, was now the most miserable distracted
Creature: As to my Wife, I lov'd her so well, and was so
sensible of the Disaster of her drinking, being the Occa-
sion of it all, that I could not resent it to such a Degree as
I had done in her Predecessor, but I pity'd her heartily;
however I put away all her Servants, and almost lock'd
her up, that is to say, I set new People over her, who
would not suffer any one to come near her without my
Knowledge.
But what to do with the Villain that had thus abused
both her and me, that was the Question that remained, to
fight him upon equal Terms, I thought was a little hard,
that after a Man had treated me as he had done, he de-
serv'd no fair Play for his Life, so I resolv'd to wait for
him in Stepney Fields, and which Way he often came
Home pretty late, and Pistol him in the Dark, and if pos-
sible, to let him know what I kill'd him for before I did it:
But when I came to consider of this, it shock'd my Tem-
per too as well as Principle, and I could not be a Murderer
whatever else I could be, or whatever I was provok'd to
be.
«
However I resolv'd on the other Hand, that I would
severely correct him for what he had done, and it was not
long before I had an Opportunity; for hearing one Morn-
ing that he was walking cross the Fields from Stepney to
Shadwell, which Way I knew he often went, I waited for
his coming Home again, and fairly met him.
I had not many Words with him, but told him I had
long look'd for him; that he knew the Villainy he had
been guilty of in my Family, and he could not believe
since he knew also, that I was fully inform'd of it; but
that I must be a great Coward as well as a Cuckold, or
that I would resent it, and that it was now a very proper
Time to call him to an Account for it, and therefore bad
him, if he durst show his Face to what he had done, and
defend the Name of a Captain of a Man of War, as they
said he had been, to draw.
He seem'd surpriz'd at the Thing, and began to parly,
and would lessen the Crime of it, but I told him it was not
a Time to talk that Way, since he could not deny the
Fact; and to lessen the Crime, was to lay it the more upon
the Woman, who, I was sure if he had not first debauch'd
with Wine, he could never have brought to the rest; and
seeing he refused to draw, I knock'd him down with my
Cane at one Blow, and I would not strike him again while
he lay on the Ground, but waited to see him recover a lit-
tle, for I saw plainly he was not kill'd; in a few Minutes
he came to himself again, and then I took him fast by one
Wrist, and can'd him as severely as I was able, and as long
as I could hold it for want of Breath, but forbore his Head,
because I was resolv'd he should feel it; in this Condition
at last he begg'd for Mercy, but I was Deaf to all Pity a
great while, till he roar'd out like a Boy soundly whip'd;
then I took his Sword from him, and broke it before his
Face, and left him on the Ground, giving him two or three
Kicks on the Backside, and bad him go and take the Law
of me, if he thought fit.
I had now as much Satisfaction, as indeed could be
taken of a Coward, and had no more to say to him: But as I
knew it would make a great Noise about the Town, I im-
mediately remov'd my Family, and that I might be per-
fectly conceal'd, went into the North of England, and
liv'd in a little Town call'd , not far from Lancas-
ter, where I liv'd retir'd, and was no more heard of, for
about two Years. My Wife, tho' more confin'd than she
used to be, and so kept up from the lewd Part; which I be-
lieve, in the Intervals of her Intemperance, she was truly
ashamed of, and abhorr'd; yet retain'd the drinking Part,
which becoming, (as I have said) necessary for her Sub-
sistance, she soon ruin'd her Health, and in about a Year
and a half after my Removal into the North, she died.
Thus I was once more a free Man, and as one would
think, should by this Time have been fully satisfy'd that
Matrimony was not appointed to be a State of Felicity to
me.
I should have mention'd, that the Villain of a Captain,
who I had drub'd, (as above) pretended to make a great
Stir about my assaulting him on the Highway, and that I
had fallen upon him with three Ruffians, with an Intent
to murder him, and this began to obtain Belief among the
People in the Neighbourhood: I sent him Word of so
much of it as I had heard, and told him, I hoped it did not
come from his own Mouth, but if it did, I expedited he
would publickly disown it, he himself declaring he knew
it to be false; or else I should be forced to acl: the same
Thing over again, till I had disciplin'd him into better
Manners; and that he might be assured, that if he con-
tinued to pretend that I had any Body with me when I
caned him, I would publish the whole Story in Print, and
besides that, would cane him again wherever I met him,
and as often as I met him, till he thought fit to defend
himself with his Sword like a Gentleman.
He gave me no Answer to this Letter, and the Satis-
faction I had for that was, that I gave twenty or thirty
Copies of it about among the Neighbours, which made it
as publick as if I had printed it, (that is, as to his Acquain-
tance and mine) and made him so hiss'd at, and hated,
that he was obliged to remove into some other part of the
Town, whither, I did not enquire.
My Wife being now dead, I knew not what Course to
take in the World, and I grew so disconsolate and dis-
couraged, that I was next Door to being distemper'd, and
sometimes indeed, I thought myself a little touch'd in my
Head. But it proved nothing but Vapours, and the Vexa-
tion of this Affair, and in about a Year's Time, or there-
abouts, it wore off again.
I had rambled up and down in a most discontented un-
settled Posture after this, I say, about a Year, and then I
considered I had three innocent Children, and I could
take no Care of them, and that I must either go away, and
leave them to the wide World, or settle here, and get
some Body to look after them, and that better a Mother-
in-Law, than no Mother, for to live such a wandering
Life it would not do; so I resolved I would Marry as any
Thing offer'd, tho' it was mean, and the meaner the bet-
ter; I concluded my next Wife should be only taken as an
upper Servant, that is to say, a Nurse to my Children, and
House-keeper to myself, and let her be Whore or honest
Woman, said I, as she likes best, I am resolv'd I won't
much concern myself about that, for I was now one de-
sperate, that valued not how Things went.
In this careless, and indeed, rash foolish Humour, I
talk'd to myself thus; if I marry an honest Woman, my
Children will be taken Care of; if she be a Slut, and abuses
me, as I see every Body does, I'll Kidnap her and send
her to Virginia, to my Plantations there, and there she
shall work hard enough, and fare hard enough to keep
her chaste, I'll warrant her.
I knew well enough at first, that these were mad hare-
brain'd Notions, and I thought no more of being serious
in them, than I thought of being a Man in the Moon:
But I know not how it happen'd to me, I reason'd and
talk'd to myself in this wild Manner so long, that I
brought myself to be seriously desperate; that is, to re-
solve upon another Marriage, with all the Suppositions
of Unhappiness that could be imagined to fall out.
And yet even this rash Resolution of my Senses did
not come presently to Action; for I was half a Year after
this, before I fix'd upon any Thing; at last, as he that
seeks Mischief shall certainly find it, so it was with me,
there happen'd to be a young, or rather a middle aged
Woman in the next Town, which was but half a Mile off,
who usually was at my House, and among my Children
every Day, when the Weather was tolerable; and tho' she
came but meerly as a Neighbour, and to see us, yet she
was always helpful in directing and ordering Things for
them, and mighty handy about them, as well before my
Wife died as after.
Her Father was one that I employed often to go to
Leverpool, and sometimes to Whitehaven, and do Busi-
ness for me; for having, as it were, settled myself in the
Northern Parts of England, I had order'd part of my Ef-
fects to be shipp'd as Occasion of Shipping offered, to
either of those two Towns, to which (the War continuing
very sharp) it was safer coming as to Privateers, than
about thro' the Channel to London.
I took a mighty Fancy at last, that this Girl would an-
swer my End, particularly that I saw she was mighty use-
ful among the Children, so on the other Hand, the Chil-
dren lov'd her very well, and I resolv'd to love her too,
flattering myself mightily, that as I had married two Gen-
tlewomen, and one Citizen, and they prov'd all three
Whores, I should now find what I wanted in an innocent
Country Wench.
I took up a world of Time in considering of this Mat-
ter ; indeed, scarce any of my Matches were done without
very mature Consideration; the second was the worst in
that Article, but in this I thought of it, I believe, four
Months most seriously before I resolv'd, and that very
Prudence spoil'd the whole Thing; however, at last be-
ing resolv'd, I took Mrs. Margaret one. Day as she pass'd
by my Parlour-Door, call'd her in, and told her I wanted
to speak with her; she came readily in, but blush'd
mightily, when I bad her sit down, for I bad her sit down
in a Chair just by me.
I us'd no great Ceremony with her, but told her, that I
had observ'd she had been mighty kind to my Children,
and was very tender to them, and that they all lov'd her,
and that if she and I could agree about it, I intended to
make her their Mother, if she was not engag'd to some
Body else; the Girl sat still, and said never a Word, till I
said those Words, if she was not engag'd to some Body else \
however, I took no Notice of it, other than this, look ye
Moggy, said I, (so they call them in the Country) if you
have promis'd yourself you must tell me; for we all knew
that a young Fellow, a good Clergyman's wicked Son,
had hung about her a great while, two or three Year, and
made Love to her, but could never get the Girl in the
Mind it seems to have him.
She knew I was not ignorant of it, and therefore, after
her first Surprize was over, she told me Mr. had, as
I knew often, come after her, but she had never promis'd
him any Thing, and had for several Years refus'd him;
her Father always telling her that he was a wicked Fellow,
and that he would be her Ruin if she had him.
Well, Moggy, then, says I, what dost say to me, art thou
free to make me a Wife? She blush'd, and look'd down
upon the Ground, and would not speak a good while; but
when I press'd her to tell me, she look'd up, and said, she
suppos'd I was but jesting with her; well, I got over that,
and told her, I was in very good Earnest with her, and I
took her for a sober, honest, modest Girl, and as, I said,
one that my Children lov'd mighty well, and I was in Ear-
nest with her, if she would give me her Consent: I would
give her my Word that I would have her, and we would
be married To-morrow Morning; she look'd up again at
that, and smil'd a little, and said no, that was too soon too
to say yes; she hop'd I would give her some Time to con-
sider of it, and to talk with her Father about it.
I told her she needed not much Time to consider about
it, but however, I would give her till To-morrow Morn-
ing, which was a great while; by this Time I had kiss'd
Moggy two or three Times, and she began to be freer with
me, and when I press'd her to marry me the next Morn-
ing, she laugh'd, and told me it was not lucky to be mar-
ried in her old Cloaths.
I stopp'd her Mouth presently with that, and told her
she should not be married in her old Cloaths, for I would
give her some new; ay, it may be afterwards, says Moggy,
and laugh'd again: No, just now, says I, come along with
me Moggy; so I carried her up Stairs into my Wife's
Room that was, and shew'd her a new Morning Gown of
my Wife's, that she had never worn above two or three
Times, and several other fine Things; look you there
Moggy, says I, there's a Wedding Gown for you, give me
your Hand now that you will have me To-morrow Morn-
ing ; and as to your Father, you know he is gone to Liver-
pool on my Business, but I will answer for it, he shall not be
angry when he comes Home to call his Master Son-in-
Law, and I ask him no Portion; therefore give me thy
Hand for it Moggy, says I, very merrily to her, and kiss'd
her again, and the Girl gave me her Hand, and very plea-
santly too, and I was mightily pleas'd with it, I assure you.
There liv'd about three Doors from us, an antient Gen-
tleman, who pass'd for a Doctor of Physick, but who was
really a Romish Priest in Orders, as there are many in that
Part of the Country, and in the Evening I sent to speak
with him: He knew that I understood his Profession, and
that I had liv'd in Popish Countries, and in a Word, be-
liev'd me a Roman too, for I was such Abroad: When he
came to me, I told him the Occasion for which I sent for
him, and that it was to be To-morrow Morning; he read-
ily told me, if I would come, and see him in the Evening,
and bring Moggy with me, he would marry us in his own
Study, and that it was rather more private to do it in the
Evening, than in the Morning; so I calYd Moggy again to
me, and told her, since she and I had agreed the Matter
for To-morrow, it was as well to be done over Night,
and told her what the Doctor had said.
MOGG2"blush'd again, and said, she must go Home
first, that she could not be ready before To-morrow; look
ye Moggy, says I, you are my Wife now, and you shall never
go away from me a Maid, I know what you mean, you
would go Home to shift you: Come Moggy, says I, come
along with me again up Stairs, so I carried her to a Chest
of Linnen, where was several new Shifts of my last Wife's
which she had never worn at all, and some that had been
worn, there's a clean Smock for you Moggy, says I, and
To-morrow you shall have all the rest: When I had done
this, now Moggy, says I, go and dress you; so I lock'd her
in, and went down Stairs; knock, says I, when you are
dress'd.
After some Time, Moggy did not knock, but down she
came into my Room, compleatly dress'd, for there were
several other Things that I bad her take, and the Cloaths
fitted her as if they had been made for her; it seems she
slipt the Lock back.
Well Moggy, says I, now you see you shan't be marry'd
in your old Cloaths, so I took her in my Arms and kiss'd
her, and well pleased I was, as ever I was in my Life, or
with any Thing I ever did in my Life; as soon as it was
dark, Moggy slip'd away before-hand, as the Doctor and I
had agreed, to the old Gentleman's House-keeper, and I
came in about half an Hour after, and there we were mar-
ry'd in the Doctor's Study, that is to say, in his Oratory,
or Chapel, a little Room within his Study, and we Staid
and supp'd with him afterward.
When after a short Stay more, I went Home first, be-
cause I would send the Children all to Bed, and the other
Servants out of the Way, and Moggy came some Time af-
ter, and so we lay together that Night; the next Morning
I let all the Family know that Moggy was my Wife, and
my three Children were rejoic'd at it to the last Degree:
And now I was a marry'd Man a fourth Time; and in
short, I was really more happy in this plain Country Girl,
than with any of all the Wives I had had: She was not
young, being about 33, but she brought me a Son the
first Year; she was very pretty, well shap'd; and of a merry
chearful Disposition, but not a Beauty; she was an ad-
mirable Family Manager, lov'd my former Children, and
used them not at all the worse for having some of her own,
in a Word, she made me an excellent Wife; but liv'd with
me but four Years, and died of a Hurt she got of a Fall
while she was with Child, and in her I had a very great
Loss indeed.
And yet such was my Fate in Wives, that after all the
Blushing and Backwardness of Mrs. Moggy at first, Mrs.
Moggy had, it seems, made a Slip in her younger Days,
and was got with Child ten Year before, by a Gentleman
of a great Estate in that Country, who promised her Mar-
riage, and afterwards deserted her: But as that had hap-
pen'd long before I came into the Country, and the Child
was dead and forgotten, the People were so good to her,
and so kind to me, that hearing I had marry'd her, no
Body ever spoke of it, neither did I ever hear of it, or sus-
pect it, till after she was in her Grave, and then it was of
small Consequence to me one way or other, and she was a
faithful, virtuous, obliging Wife to me. I had very severe
Affliction indeed, while she lived with me, for the Small-
Pox, a frightful Distemper in that Country, broke into
my Family, and carry'd off three of my Children, and a
Maid-Servant; so that I had only one of my former
Wife's, and one by my Moggy, the first a Son, the last a
Daughter.
While these Things were in Agitation, came on the
Invasion of the Scots, and the Fight at Preslon, and I have
Cause to bless the Memory of my Moggy, for I was all on
Fire on that Side, and just going away with Horse and
Arms, to join the Lord Derwentwater; but Moggy begg'd
me off, (as I may call it) and hung about me so, with her
Tears and Importunities, that I sat still and look'd on,
for which I had Reason to be thankful.
I was really a sorrowful Father, and the Loss of my
Children stuck close to me, but the Loss of my Wife stuck
closer to me than all the rest, nor was my Grief lessen'd,
or my kindest Thoughts abated in the least, by the Ac-
count I heard of her former Miscarriages, seeing they
were so long before I knew her, and were not discover'd
by me, or to me, in her Life-time.
All these Things put together made me very comfort-
less : And now I thought Heaven summon'd me to retire
to Virginia, the Place, and (as I may say) the only Place I
had been bless'd at, or had met with any Thing that de-
serv'd the Name of Success in, and where indeed, my Af-
fairs being in good Hands, the Plantations were increas'd
to such a Degree, that some Years my Return here made
up eight Hundred Pound, and one Year almost a Thou-
sand ; so I resolv'd to leave my native Country once more,
and taking my Son with me, and leaving Moggy's Daugh-
ter with her Grandfather,I made him my principal Agent,
left him considerable in his Hands, for the Maintenance
VOl. II g
of the Child, and left my Will in his Hand, by which, if I
died before I should otherwise provide for her, I left her
2000 /. Portion, to be paid by my Son out of the Estate
I had in Virginia, and the whole Estate if he died un-
married.
I embark'd for Virginia, in the Year , at the Town
of Liverpool, and had a tollerable Voyage thither, only
that we met with a Pyrate Ship, in the Latitude of 48 De-
grees, who plunder'd us of every Thing they could come
at that was for their Turn, that is to say, Provisions, Am-
munition, small Arms and Money; but to give the Ro-
gues their due, tho' they were the most abandon'd Wret-
ches that were ever seen, they did not use us ill; and as to
my Loss, it was not considerable, the Cargo which I had
on Board, was in Goods, and was of no Use to them; nor
could they come at those Things without rumaging the
whole Ship, which they did not think worth their while.
I found all my Affairs in very good Order at Virginia,
my Plantations prodigiously increas'd, and my Manager
who first inspired me with travelling Thoughts, and
made me Master of any Knowledge worth naming, re-
ceiv'd me with a Transport of Joy, after a Ramble of four
and twenty Years.
I ought to remember it to the Encouragement of all
faithful Servants, that he gave me an Account, which I
believe was critically Just, of the whole Affair of the Plan-
tations, each by themselves, and ballanc'd in Years, every
Year's Produce being fully transmitted, Charges deduct-
ed, to my Order at London.
I was exceedingly satisfied, as I had good Reason in-
deed with his Management, and with his Management,
as much in its Degree of his own, I can safely say it: He
had improv'd a very large Plantation of his own at the
same Time, which he began upon the Foot of the Coun-
try's Allowance of Land, and the Encouragement he had
from me.;
When he had given me all this pleasing agreeable Ac-
count, you will not think it strange, that I had a Desire to
see the Plantations, and to view all the Servants, which in
both the Works were upwards of three Hundred; and as
my Tutor generally bought some every Fleet that came
from England, I had the Mortification to see two or three
of the Predion Gentlemen there, who being Prisoners of
War, were spar'd from the publick Execution, and sent
over for to that Slavery, which to Gentlemen must be
worse than Death.
I do not mention what I did or said, relating to them
here, I shall speak at large of it, when the rest of them
came over, which more nearly concern'd me.
BuTone Circumstance occurr'd to mehere, that equal-
ly surpriz'd me, and terrify'd me to the last Degree; look-
ing over all the Servants, as I say above, and viewing the
Plantations narrowly and frequently, I came one Day by
a Place where some Women were at Work by themselves:
I was seriously reflecting on the Misery of human Life,
when I saw some of those poor Wretches; thought I,they
have perhaps liv'd gay, and pleasantly in the World, not-
withstanding, thro' a Variety of Distresses, they may
have been brought to this; and if a Body was to hear the
History of some of them now, itwould perhaps be as mov-
ing, and as seasonable a Sermon as any Minister in the
Country could Preach.
Wh1le I was musing thus, and looking at the Women,
on a sudden I heard a Combustion among other of the
Women Servants, who were almost behind me in the
same Work, and Help was call'd loudly for, one of the
Women having swoon'd away; they said she would die
immediately if something was not done to relieve her; I
had nothing about me, but a little Bottle,which we always
carried about us there with Rum, to give any Servant a
Dram that merited that Favour; so I turn'd my Horse,
and went up towards the Place; but as the poor Creature
was lying flat on the Ground, and the rest of the Women
Servants about her, I did not see her, but gave them the
Bottle, and they rub'd her Temples with it, and with
much a-do brought her to Life, and gave her a little to
drink, but she could drink none of it, and was exceeding
ill afterwards, so that she was carried to the Infirmary, so
they call it in the Religious Houses in Italy, where the sick
Nuns or Friers are carried; but here in Virginia, I think
they should call it the Condemn'd-hole, for it really was
only a Place just fit for People to die in, not a Place to be
cur'd in.
The sick Woman refusing to drink, one of the Women
Servants brought me the Bottle again, and I bad them
drink it among them,which had almost set them together
by the Ears for the Liquor, there being not enough to
give every one a Sup.
I went Home to my House immediately, and reflect-
ing on the miserable Provision was wont to be made for
poor Servants, when they were sick, I enquir'd of my
Manager, if it was so still? He said, he believ'd mine was
better than any in the Country; but he confess'd it was
but sad Lodging; however, he said, he would go and look
after it immediately, and see how it was.
He came to me again about an Hour after, and told me
the Woman was very ill, and frighted with her Condi-
tion, that she seem'd to be very Penitent, for someThings
in her past Life, which lay heavy upon her Mind, believ-
ing she should die; that she ask'd him, if there was no
Ministers to comfort poor dying Servants? And he told
her, that she knew they had no Minister nearer than such
a Place; but that if she liv'd till Morning, he should be
sent for. He told me also, that he had remov'd her into a
Room where their chief Workman us'd to Lodge; that
he had given her a Pair of Sheets, and every Thing he
could, that he thought she wanted, and had appointed
another Woman Servant to tend her, and sit up with her.
Well, says I, that's well, for I cannot bear to have poor
Creatures lie and perish, by the meer Hardship of the
Place they are in, when they are Sick, and want Help:
Besides, said I, some of those unfortunate Creatures, they
call Convicts, may be People that have been tenderly
brought up. Really Sir, says he, this poor Creature I al-
ways said had something of a Gentlewoman in her, I
could see it by her Behaviour, and I have heard the other
Women say, that she liv'd very great once, and that she
had fifteen Hundred Pound to her Portion, and I dare say
she has been a handsome Woman in her Time, and she
has a Hand as fine as a Ladies now, tho' it be tanned with
the Weather; I dare say she was never brought up to La-
bour as she does here, and she says to the rest that it will
kill her.
Truly, says I, it may be so, and that may be the Reason
that she faints under it; and, I added, is there nothing you
can put her to within Doors, that may not be so Labori-
ous, and expose her to so much Heat and Cold; he told
me yes, there was; he could set her to be the House-
keeper, for the Woman that lately was such, was out of
her Time, and was married and turn'd Planter. Why then
let her have it, said I, if she recovers, and in the mean
Time go, said I, and tell her so, perhaps the Comfort of it
may help to restore her.
He did so, and with that, taking good Care of her, and
giving her good warm Diet, the Woman recover'd, and
in a little Time was Abroad again; for it was the meer
Weight of Labour, and being expos'd to hard Lodging,
and mean Diet, to one so tenderly bred, that struck her,
and she fainted at her Work.
When she was made House-keeper, she was quite an-
other Body; she put all the Houshold into such excellent
Order, and manag'd their Provisions so well, that my Tu-
tor admir'd her Conduct, and would be every now and
then speaking of her to me, that she was an excellent Man-
ager; I'll warrant, says he, she has been bred a Gentle-
woman, and she has been a fine Woman in her Time too:
In a Word, he said so many good Things of her, that I
had a Mind to see her; so one Day I took Occasion to go
to the Plantation-House, as they call'd it, and into a Par-
lour, always reserv'd for the Master of the Plantation;
there she had Opportunity to see me before I could see
her, and as soon as she had seen me, she knew me; but in-
deed, had I seen her an hundred Times, I should not have
known her; she was, it seems, in the greatest Confusion
and Surprize at seeing who I was, that it was possible for
any one to be; and when I order'd my Manager to bring
her into the Room, he found her crying, and begg'd him
to excuse her, that she was frighted, and should die away,
if she came near me.
I not imagining any Thing, but that the poor Creature
was afraid of me, (for Maslers in Virginia are terrible
Things) bad him tell her she need to be under no Con-
cern at my calling for her, for it was not for any Hurt, nor
for any Displeasure, but that I had some Orders to give
her; so having, as he thought, encourag'd her, (tho' her
Surprize was of another Kind) he brought her in; when
she came in, she held a Handkerchief in her Hand, wip-
ing her Eyes, as if she had cry'd, Mrs. House-keeper,
said I, (speaking chearfully to her) don't be concern'd at
my sending for you, I have had a very good Account of
your Management, and I call'd for you, to let you know I
am very well pleas'd with it; and if it falls in my Way to
do you any good, if your Circumstances will allow it, I
may be willing enough to help you out of your Misery.
She made low Curtisies, but said nothing; however,
she was so far encourag'd, that she took her Hand from
her Face, and I saw her Face fully, and I believe she did
it, desiring I should discover who she was, but I really
knew nothing of her any more, than if I had never seen
her in my Life; but went on, as I thought, to encourage
her, as I us'd to do with any that I saw deserv'd it.
In the mean Time my Tutor, who was in the Room,
went out on some Business or other, I know not what; as
soon as he was gone, she burst out into a Passion, and fall
down on her Knees just before me: O I Sir, says she, I see
you don't know me, be merciful to me, I am your miserable di-
vorc'd Wifel
I was astonish'd, I was frighted, I trembled like one in
an Ague, I was speechless; in a Word, I was ready to sink
and she fell flat on her Face, and lay there, as if she had
been dead: I was speechless, I say, as a Stone, I had only
presence of Mind enough to step to the Door, and fasten
it, that my Tutor might not come in: Then going back to
her, I took her up, and spoke comfortably to her, and
told her, I no more knew her, than if I had never seen
her.
O! Sir, said she, Affliclions are dreadful Things, such as I
have suffer'd have been enough to alter my Countenance; but
forgive, said she, for God's Sake the Injuries I have done
you: I have paid dear for all my Wickedness, and 'tis Jusl,
'tis Righteous that God should bring me to your Foot, to ask
your Pardon for all my brutish Doings: Forgive me Sir, said
she, I beseech you, and let me be your Slave or Servant for it
as long as I live, 'tis all I ask: And with those Words, she
fell upon her Knees again, and cry'd so vehemently, that
it was impossible for her to stop it, or to speak a Word
more. I took her up again, made her sit down, desir'd her
to compose herself, and to hear what I was going to say,
tho' indeed it touch'd me so sensibly, I was hardly able to
speak any more than she was.
Fi rst, I told her it was such a Surprize to me, that I was
not able to say much to her, and indeed the Tears ran
down my Face almost as fast as they did on hers, I told her
that I should only tell her now, that as no Body had yet
known any Thing that had pass'd, so it was absolutely
necessary not a Word of it should be known, that it should
not be the worse for her, that she was thus thrown into
my Hands again; but that I could do nothing for her if it
was known, and therefore that her future good, or ill For-
tune, would depend upon her entire concealing it; that as
my Manager would come in again presently, she should
go back to her Part of the House, and go on in the Busi-
ness, as she did before; that I would come to her, and
talke more at large with her in a Day or two; so she retir'd,
after assuring me that not a Word of it should go out of
her Mouth, and indeed she was willing to retire before
my Tutor came again, that he might not see the Agony
she was in.
I was so perplex'd about this surprizing Incident, that
I hardly knew what I did or said all that Night, nor was I
come to any settled Resolution in the Morning, what
Course to take in it: However, in that Morning I call'd
my Tutor, and told him that I had been exceedingly con-
cern'd about the poor distress'd Creature, the House-
keeper; that I had heard some of her Story, which was
very dismal; that she had been in very good Circumstan-
ces, and was bred very well, and that I was glad he had re-
mov'd her out of the Field into the House; but still she
was almost naked, and that I would have him go to the
Warehouse and give her some Linnen, especially Head-
Cloaths, and all Sorts of small Things, such as Hoods,
Gloves, Stockings, Shoes, Petticoats, etc. and to let her
chuse for herself; also a Morning-Gown of Callicoe, and
a Mantua of a better kind of Callicoe; that is to say, to
new Cloath her, which he did: But brought me Word, that
he found her all in Tears, and that she had cry'd all Night
long, and in short, he believ'd she would indeed cry her-
self to Death; that all the while she was receiving the
Things he gave her, she cry'd; that now and then she
would struggle with, and stop it, but that then upon an-
other Word speaking, she would burst out again, so that
it griev'd every Body that saw her.
I was really affected with her Case very much, but
struggled hard with myself to hide it, and turn'd the Dis-
course to something else; in the mean Time, tho' I did
not go to her the next Day, nor till the third Day, yet I
studied Day and Night how to act, and what I should do
in this remarkable Case.
When I came to the House, which was the third Day,
she came into the Room I was in, cloath'd all over with
my Things which I had ordered her, and told me, She
thank'd God she was now my Servant again, and wore my
Livery, thank'd me for the Cloaths I had sent her, and said it
was much more than she had deserv'dfrom me.
I then entered into Discourses with her, no Body be-
ing present but ourselves, and first I told her, She should
name no more of the unkind Things had had past; for she
had humbled herself more than enough on that Subject,
and I would never reproach her with any Thing that was
past, I found that she had been the deepest Sufferer by
far; I told her it was impossible for me, in my present
Circumstances, to receive her there as a Wife, who came
over as a Convict, neither did she know so little as to de-
sire it: But, I told her, I might be instrumental to put an
End to her Misfortunes in the World, and especially to
the miserable Part of it, which was her present Load, pro-
vided she could effectually keep her own Council, and
never let the Particulars come out of her Mouth, and that
from the Day she did, she might date her irrecoverable
Ruin.
She was as sensible of the Necessity of that Part, as I
was, and told me all she could claim of me, would be only
to deliver her from her present Calamity, that she was not
able to support; and that then, if I pleased, she might live
such a Life, as that she might apply the Residue of what
Time she should have, wholly to Repentance; that she
was willing to do the meanest Offices in the World for me;
and tho' she should rejoice to hear that I would forgive
her former Life, yet that she would not look any higher
than to be my Servant, as long as she liv'd; and in the
mean Time, I might be satisfy'd she would never let any
Creature so much as know that I had ever seen her before.
I ask'd her, if she was willing to let me into any Part of
the History of her Life, since she and I parted, but I did
not insist upon it otherwise, than as she thought conveni-
ent; she said, as her Breach with me began first in Folly,
and ended in Sin, so her whole Life afterward was a con-
tinu'd Series of Calamity, Sin and Sorrow, Sin and Shame,
and at last Misery; that she was deluded into gay Com-
pany, and to an expensive Way of Living, which betray'd
her to several wicked Courses to support the Expences of
it; that after a thousand Distresses and Difficulties, being
not able to maintain herself, she was reduced to extreme
Poverty.
That she would many Times have humbled herself to
me in the lowest and most submissive Manner in the
World, being sincerely Penitent for her first Crime, but
that she never could hear of me, nor which Way I was
gone; that she was by that Means so abandon'd, that she
wanted Bread, and those Wants and Distresses brought
her into bad Company of another Kind, and that she fell
in among a Gang of Thieves, with whom she herded for
some Time, and got Money enough a great while, but
under the greatest Dread and Terror imaginable, being
in the constant Fear of coming to Shame, that afterwards,
what she fear'd,was come upon her, and for a very trifling
Attempt, in which she was not Principal, but accidentally
concern'd, she was sent to this Place. She told me, her
Life was such a Collection of various Fortunes, up and
down, in Plenty, and in Misery; in Prison, and at Liber-
ty; at Ease, and in Torment; that it would take up a great
many Days to give me a History of it; that I was come to
see the End of it, as I had seen the best Part of the Begin-
ning; that I knew she was brought up tenderly, and fair'd
delicately; but that now she was with the Prodigal, brought
to desire Husks with Swine, and even to want that Sup-
ply: Her Tears flow'd so strongly upon this Discourse,
that they frequently interrupted her, so that she could not
go on without Difficulty, and at last could not go on at all;
so I told her, I would excuse her telling any more of her
Story at that Time; that I saw it was but a renewing of her
Grief, and that I would rather contribute to her forget-
ting what was past, and desir'd her to say no more of it, so
I broke off that Part.
In the mean Time, I told her, since Providence had
thus cast her upon my Hands again, I would take Care
that she should not want, and that she should not live
hardly neither, tho* I could go no farther at present, and
thus we parted for that Time, and we continu'd in the
Business of House-keeper, only, that to ease her, I gave
her an Assistant, and tho' I would not have it call'd so, it
was neither more nor less than a Servant to wait on her,
and do every Thing for her, and told her too, that it was so.
After she had been some Time in this Place, shere-
cover'd her Spirits, and grew chearful; her fallen Flesh
plump'd up, and the sunk and hollow Parts fill'd again;
so that she began to recover something of that Brightness,
andcharmingCountenance,whichwasonce so very agree-
able to me; and sometimes I could not help having
warm Desires towards her, and of taking her into her first
Station again; but there were many Difficulties occurr'd,
which I could not get over a great while.
But in the mean Time another odd Accident happen'd,
which put me to a very great Difficulty, and more than I
could have thought such a Thing could be capable of; my
Tutor, a Man of Wit and Learning, and full of generous
Principles, who was at first mov'd with Compassion for
the Misery of this Gentlewoman, and even then, thought
there were some Things more than common in her, as I
have hinted: Now, when, as I say, she was recover'd, and
her sprightly Temper restor'd and comforted, he was
charm'd so with her Conversation, that in short, he fell in
Love with her.
I hinted in my former Account of her, that she had a
charming Tongue, was Mistress of abundance of Wit,
that she sung incomparably fine, and was perfectly well
bred, these all remained with her still, and made her a
very agreeable Person; and in short, he came to me one
Evening, and told me, that he came to ask my Leave to
let him marry the House-keeper.
I was exceedingly perplex'd at this Proposal, but how-
ever, I gave him no Room to perceive that; I told him I
hop'd he had consider'd well of it before he brought it so
far as to offer it to me, and supposed that he had agreed
that Point so, that I had no Consent to give, but as she
had almost four Year of her Time to serve.
He answered no, he paid such a Regard to me, that he
would not so much as take one Step in such a Thing with-
out my Knowledge, and assured me, he had not so much
as mentioned it to her. I knew not what Answer indeed to
make to him, but at last I resolv'd to put it off from my-
self to her, because then I should have Opportunity to
talk with her before hand; so I told him he was perfectly
free to act in the Matter as he thought fit; that I could not
say either one Thing or another to it, neither had I any
right to meddle in it; as to her serving out her Time with
me, that was a Trifle, and not worth naming, but I hop'd
he would consider well every Circumstance before he en-
tered upon such an Affair as that.
He told me he had fully consider'd it already, and that
he was resolv'd seeing I was not against it, to have her
whatever came of it, for he believ'd he should be the hap-
piest Man alive with her; then he run on in his Character
of her, how clever a Woman she was in the Management
of all manner of Business, what admirable Conversation
she was, what a Wit, what a Memory, what a vast Share
of Knowledge, and the like; all which I knew to be the
Truth, and yet short of her just Character too; for as she
was all that formerly when she was mine, she was vastly
improv'd in the School of Affliction, and was all the bright
Part, with a vast Addition of Temper, Prudence, Judg-
ment, and all that she formerly wanted.
I had not much Patience, as you may well imagine, till
I saw my honest House-keeper, to communicate this Se-
cret to her, and to see what Course she would steer on so
nice an Occasion; but I was suddenly taken so ill with a
Cold, which held for two Days, that I could not stir out of
Doors; and in thisTime the Matter was all done and over,
for my Tutor had gone the same Night, and made his At-
tack, but was coldly receiv'd at first, which very much
surpriz'd him, for he made no Doubt to have her Consent
at first Word; however, the next Day he came again, and
again the third Day, when finding he was in earnest, and
yet that she could not think of any Thing of that kind, she
told him in few Words, that she thought herself greatly
oblig'd to him for such a Testimony of his Respect to her,
and should have embrac'd it willingly, as any Body would
suppose one in her Circumstances should do, but that she
would not abuse him so much; for that she must acknow-
ledge to him, she was under Obligations that prevented
her, that was in short, that she was a married Woman,
and had a Husband alive.
This was so sincere, but so effectual an Answer, that
he could have no Room to reply one Word to it; but that
he was very sorry, and that it was a very great Affliction
to him, and as great a Disappointment as ever he met
with.
The next Day after he had receiv'd this Repulse, I
cametothePlantation-House,andsendingfortheHouse-
keeper, I began with her, and told her that I understood
she would have a very advantageous Proposal made to
her, and that I would have her consider well of it, and
then told her what my Tutor had said to me.
She immediately fell a crying, at which I seem'd to
wonder very much. O! Sir, says she, how can you name
such a Thing to me? I told her that I could name it the
better to her, because I had been married myself since I
parted from her: Yes Sir, says she, but the Case alters,
the Crime being on my Side, I ought not to marry; but,
says she, that is not the Reason at all, but I cannot do it; I
pretended to press her to it, (tho' not sincerely I must ac-
knowledge, for my Heart had turned toward her for some
Time, and I had fully forgiven her in my Mind all her
former Conduct) but, I say, I seem'd to press her to it, at
which she burst out in a Passion; No, no, says she, let me
be your Slave, rather than the best Man's Wife in the
World: I reasoned with her upon her Circumstances, and
how such a Marriage would restore her to a State of Ease
and Plenty, and none in the World might ever know or
suspect who or what she had been, but she could not bear
it; but with Tears again raising her Voice, that I was
afraid she would be heard. I beseech you, says she, do not
speak of it any more, I was once yours, and I will never
belong to any Man else in the World; let me be as I am,
or any Thing else you please to make me, but not a Wife
to any Man alive but yourself.
I was so mov'd with the Passion she was in at speaking
this, that I knew not what I said or did for some Time; at
length I said to her, it is a great Pity you had not long ago
been as sincere as you are now, it had been better for us
both, however, as it is, you shall not be forced to any
Thing against your Mind, nor shall you be the worse
treated for refusing; but how will you put him off? No
doubt he experts you will receive his Proposal, as an Ad-
vantage, and as he sees no farther into your Circumstan-
ces, so it is. O! Sir, says she, I have done all that already,
he has his Answer, and is fully satisfied, he will never
trouble you any more on that Head, and then she told me
what Answer she had given him.
From that Minute I resolv'd that I would certainly
take her again to be my Wife as before, I thought she had
fully made me Amends for her former ill Conduct, and
she deserv'd to be forgiven; and so indeed she did, if ever
Woman did, considering also what dreadful Penance she
had undergone, and how long she had liv'd in Misery and
Distress; and that Providence had, as it were, cast her up-
on me again, and above all, had given her such an Affec-
tion to me, and so resolv'd a Mind, that she could refuse
so handsome an Offer of Deliverance, rather than be far-
ther separated from me.
As I resolved this in my Mind, so I thought it was
cruel to conceal it any longer from her; nor indeed could
I contain myself any longer, but I took her in my Arms;
well says I, you have given me such a Testimony of Af-
fection in this, that I can no longer withstand, I forgive
you all that ever was between us on this Account, and
since you will be no Body's but mine, you shall be mine
again as you were at first.
But this was too much for her the other Way, and now
she was so far over-come with my yielding to her, that had
she not got vent to her Passion, by the most vehement
crying, she must have died in my Arms, and I was forc'd
to let her go, and set her down in a Chair, where she cry'd
for a Quarter of an Hour before she could speak a Word.
When she was come to herself enough to talk again, I
told her we must consider of a Method how to bring this
to pass; and that it must not be done by publishing there
that she was my Wife before, for that would expose us
both, but that I would openly marry her again; this she
agreed was very rational, and accordingly about two
Months after we were married again, and no Man in the
World ever enjoy'd a better Wife, or liv'd more happy
than we did both for several Years after.
And now I began to think my Fortunes were settled
for this World, and I had nothing before me but to finish
a Life of infinite Variety, such as mine had been, with a
comfortable Retreat, being both made wiser by our Suf-
ferings and Difficulties, and able to judge for ourselves
what kind of Life would be best adapted to our present
Circumstances, and in what Station we might look upon
ourselves to be most compleatly happy.
But Man is a short sighted Creature at best, and in no-
vol. ii h
thing more than in that of fixing his own Felicity, or, as
we may say, choosing for himself: One would have
thought, and so my Wife often suggested to me, that the
State of Life that I was now in, was as perfectly calculated
to make a Man compleatly happy, as any private Station
in the World could be: We had an Estate more than suffi-
cient, and daily encreasing, for the supporting any State
or Figure that in that Place we could propose to ourselves,
or even desire to live in: We had every Thing that was
pleasant and agreeable, without the least Mortification
in any Circumstances of it; every sweet Thing, and no
thing to imbitter it; every Good, and no mixture of Evil
with it; nor any Gap open where we could have the least
Apprehensions of any Evil breaking out upon us; nor in-
deed was it easy for either of us in our phlegmatick melan-
choly Notions, to have the least Imagination how any
Thing disastrous could happen to us in the common
Course of Things, unless something should befall us out
of the ordinary Way of Providence, or of its acting in the
World.
But an unseen Mine blew up all this apparent Tran-
quillity at once, and tho' it did not remove my Affairs
there from me, yet it effectually remov'd me from them,
and sent me a wandring into the World again; a Condi-
tion full of Hazards, and always attended with Circum-
stances dangerous to Mankind, while he is left to choose
his own Fortunes, and be guided by his own short sight-
ed Measures.
I must now return to a Circumstance of my History,
which had been past for some Time, and which relates to
my Conduct , while I was last in England.
I ment1on'd how my faithful Wife Moggy, with her
Tears and her Entreaties, had prevail'd with me not to
play the Mad-man, and openly join in the Rebellion with
the late Lord Derwentwater and his Party, when they en-
ter'd Lancashire, and thereby, as I may, saved my Life.
But my Curiosity prevail'd so much at last, that I gave her
the Slip when they came to Preslon, and at least thought I
would go and look at them, and see what they were likely
to come to.
My former Wife's Importunities as above, had indeed
prevail'd upon me from publickly embarking in that En-
terprize, and joining openly with them in Arms; and by
this, as I have observ'd, she sav'd my Life to be sure, be-
cause I had then publickly espoused the Rebellion, and
had been known to have been among them, which might
have been as fatal to me afterwards, tho' I had not been
taken in the Action as if I had.
BuTwhen they advanc'd, and came nearer to us to Pres-
ton, and there appear'd a greater Spirit among the People
in their Favour; my old Doctor, who I mention'd before,
who was a Romish Priest, and had married us, inspir'd me
with new Zeal, and gave me no Rest, till he oblig'd me
with only a good Horse and Arms to join them the Day
before they enter'd Preslon, he himself venturing in the
same Posture with me.
I was not so publick here as to be very well known, at
least by any one that had Knowledge of me in the Coun-
try where I liv'd; and this was indeed my Safety after-
ward, as you will soon hear; but yet I was known too
among the Men, especially among the Scots, with some
of whom I had been acquainted in Foreign Service; with
these I was particularly conversant, and passed for a
French Officer: I talk'd to them of making a select De-
tachment to defend the Pass between Pretton, and the
River and Bridge; upon maintaining which, as I insisted,
depended the Safety of the whole Party.
It was with some Warmth that I spoke of that Affair,
and as I passed among them I say, for a French Officer,
and a Man of Experience, it caused several Debates
among them; but the Hint was not followed, as is well
known, and from that Moment I gave them all up as lost,
and meditating nothing but how to escape from them,
which I effected the Night before they were surrounded
by the Royal Cavalry: I did not do this without great Dif-
ficulty, swimming the River Ribble, at a Place, where tho'
I got well over, yet I could not for a long while get to a
Place where my Horse cou'd Land himself, that is to say,
where the Ground was firm enough for him to take the
Land; however, at length I got on Shore, and riding very
hard, came the next Evening in sight of my own Dwel-
ling, here after lying by in a Wood till theDepth of Night,
I shut my Horse in a little kind of a Gravel Pit, or Marl-
Pit, where I soon cover'd him with Earth for the present,
and marching all alone, I came about two in the Morning
to my House, where my Wife surpriz'd with Joy, and yet
terribly frighted, let me in, and then I took immediate
Measures to secure myself upon whatever Incidentmight
happen, but which as Things were order'd, I had no need
to make use of, for the Rebels being entirely defeated,
and either all killed or taken Prisoners, I was not known
by any Body in the Country to have been among them;
no, nor so much as suspected, and thus I made a narrow
Escape from the most dangerous Action, and most fool-
ishly embark'd in, of any that I had ever been engag'd in
before.
It was very lucky to me that I killed and bury'd my
Horse, for he would have been taken two Days after, and
would to be sure have been known by those who had seen
me upon him at Preslon; but now, as none knew I had
been Abroad, nor any such Circumstance could discover
me, I kept close, and as my Excursion had been short,
and I had not been missed by any of my Neighbours,
if any Body came to speak with me, behold, I was at
Home.
However, I was not thoroughly easy in my Mind, and
secretly wish'd I was in my own Dominions in Virginia, to
which, in a little Time, other Circumstances occurring, I
made Preparations to remove with my whole Family.
I n the mean Time, as above, the Action at Preslon hap-
pen'd, and the miserable People surrender'dtothe King's
Troops, some were Executed for Examples, as in such
Cases is usual, and the Government extending Mercy to
the Multitude, they were kept in Chesler Castle, andother
Places a considerable Time, till they were disposed of,
some one Way, some another, as we shall hear.
SEVERAlHundredsof them after this, wereattheir own
Request Transported, as 'tis vulgarly expressed, to the
Plantations, that is to say, sent to Virginia, and other
British Colonies, to be sold after the usual Mannerof con-
demn'd Criminals, or, as we call them there, Convicts, to
serve a limitted Time in the Country, and then be made
Freemen again; some of these I have spoken of above;
but now to my no little Uneasiness, I found, after I had
been there some Time, two Ships arrived with more of
these People in the same River where all my Plantations
lay.
I no sooner heard of it, but the first Step I took was, to
resolve to let none of them be bought into my Work, or
to any of my Plantations; and this I did, pretending that
I would not make Slaves every Day of unfortunate Gen-
tlemen, who fell into that Condition for their Zeal to their
Party only, and the like: But the true Reason was, that I
expected several of them would know me, and might per-
haps betray me, and make it public, that I was one of the
same sort, but had made my Escape, and so I might be
brought into Trouble; and if I came off with my Life,
might have all my Effects seiz'd on, and be reduc'd to
Misery and Poverty again at once, all which I thought I
had done enough to deserve.
This was a just Caution, but as I found quickly, was
not a sufficient one, as my Circumstances stood for my
Safety; for tho' I bought none of these poor Men my self,
yet several of my Neighbours did, and there was scarce a
Plantation near me but had some of them, more or less
among them; so that in a Word, I could not peep abroad
hardly, but I was in Danger to be seen and known too, by
some or other of them.
I may be allow'd to say, that this was a very uneasy Life
to me, and such, that in short, I found myself utterly un-
able to bear; for I was now reduced from a great Man, a
Magistrate, a Governor, or Master of three Plantations,
and having three or four Hundred Servants at my Com-
mand, to be a poor self condemn'd Rebel, and durst not
shew my Face; and that I might with the same Safety, or
rather more, have skulk'd about in Lancashire where I
was, or gone up to London, and conceal'd myself there till
Things had been over; but now the Danger was come
Home to me, even to my Door, and I expected nothing
but to be inform'd against every Day, be taken up and
sent to England in Irons, and have all my Plantations
seiz'd on, as a forfeited Estate to the Crown.
I HADbut one Hope of Safety to trust to, and that was,
that having been so little a while among them, done no-
thing for them, and passing for a Stranger, they never
knew my Name, but only I was call'd the French Colonel,
or the French Officer, or the French Gentleman, by most,
if not by all the People there; and as for the Doctor that
went with me, he had found Means to escape too, tho'not
the same Way that I did, finding the Cause not like to be
supported, and that the King's Troops were gathering
on all Sides round them like a Cloud.
But toreturn to myself, this was no Satisfaction to me,
and what to do I really knew not; for I was more at a Loss
how to shift in such a distressed Case as this, now it lay so
close to me, than ever I was in any Difficulty of my Life:
The first Thing I did was to come Home, and make a
Confidence of the whole Affair to my Wife; and tho' I did
it generously without Conditions, yet I did not do it with-
out first telling her, how I was now going to put my Life
into her Hands, that she might have it in her Power to
pay me Home, for all that she might think had been hard
in my former Usage of her; and that in short, it would be
in her Power to deliver me up into the Hands of my Ene-
mies, but that I would trust her Generosity, as well as her
renew'd Affection, and put all upon her Fidelity, and
without any more Precaution, I open'd the whole Thing
to her, and particularly, the Danger I was now in.
A fa1thful Counsellor is Life from the Dead, gives
Courage where the Heart is sinking, and raises the Mind
to a proper Use of Means; and such she was to me in-
deed, upon every Step of this Affair, and it was by her
Direction that I took every Step that followed for the ex-
tricating myself out of this Labyrinth.
Come, come my Dear, says she, if this be all, there is no
Room for any such disconsolate doings as your Fears run
you upon; for I was immediately for selling off my Plan-
tations, and all my Stock, and embarking myself forth-
with, and to get to Maderas, or to any Place out of the
King's Dominions.
But my Wife was quite of another Opinion, and en-
couraging me on another Account, proposed two Things,
either my freighting a Sloop with Provisions to the Wen-
Indies, and so taking Passage from thence to London, or
letting her go away directly for England, and endeavour
to obtain the King's Pardon whatever it might cost.
Iinclin'd to the last Proposal, fortho' I was unhappily
prejudic'd in Favour of a wrong Interest, yet I had al-
ways a Secret and right Notion of the Clemency and mer-
ciful Disposition of his Majesty, and had I been in Eng-
land, should I believe, have been easily persuaded to have
thrown myself at his Feet.
But going to England as I was, Circumstances must
have been a publick Action, and I must have made all the
usual Preparations for it, must have appear'd in Publick,
have staid till the Crop was ready, and gone away in
Form and State as usual, or have acted as if something ex-
traordinary was the Matter, and have fill'd the Heads of
the People there with innumerable Suggestions of they
knew not what.
But my Wife made all this easy to me, from her own
Invention; for without acquainting me with any Thing,
she comes merrily to me one Morning before I was up:
My Dear, says she, I am very sorry to hear that you are
not very well this Morning, I have order'd Pennico, that
was a young Negro Girl which I had given her, to make
you a Fire in your Chamber, and pray lie still where you
are a while, till 'tis done; at the same Instant the little
Negroe came in with Wood, and a pair of Bellows, etc. to
kindle the Fire, and my Wife not giving me Timetoreply,
whispers close to my Ear to lie still, and say nothing till
she came up again to me.
I was thoroughly frighted, that you may be sure of and
thought of nothing but of being discover'd, betray'd,
carried to England, hang'd, quarter'd, and all that was
terrible, and my very Heart sunk within me; she per-
ceiv'd my Disorder, and turn'd back, assuring me there
was no Harm, desir'd me to be easy, and she would come
back again presently, and give me Satisfaction in every
particular that I could desire; so I composed myself a
while as well as I could, but it was but a little while that I
could bear it, and I sent Pennico down Stairs to find out
her Mistress, and tell her I was very ill, and must speak
with her immediately, and the Girl was scarce out of the
Room before I jump'd out of Bed and began to dress me,
that I might be ready for all Events.
My Wife was as good as her Word, and was coming
upas the Girl was coming down; I see, says she, you want
Patience, but pray do not want Government of yourself,
but take that Skreen before your face, and go to the Win-
dow, and see if you know any of those Scotchmen that are
in the Yard, for there are seven or eight of them come
about some Business to your Clerk.
I went and look'd through the Screen, and saw the
Faces of them all distinctly, but could make nothing of
them, other than that they were Scotchmen, which was
easy to discern; however it was no Satisfaction to me that
I knew not their Faces, for they might know mine for all
that, according to the old English Proverb, That more
knows Tom Fool, than Tom Fool knows; so I kept close in
my Chamber till I understood they were all gone.
After this, my Wife caused it to be given out in the
House that I was not well, and when this not being well
had lasted three or four Days, I had my Leg wrap'd up in
a great Piece of Flannel, and laid upon a Stool, and there
I was lame of the Gout; and this serv'd for about six
Weeks, when my Wife told me she had given it out,
that my Gout was rather Rheumatick than asettled Gout,
and that I was resolv'd to take one of my own Sloops, and
go to Nevis or Antegua, and use the hot Baths there for my
Cure.
Aixthiswas very well, and I approv'd my Wife's Con-
trivance as admirably good, both to keep me within
Doors eight or ten Weeks at first, and to convey me away
afterwards without any extraordinary Bustle to be made
about it; but still I did not know what it all tended to, and
what the Design of it all was, but my Wife desir'd me to
leave that to her, so I readily did, and she carried it all on
with a Prudence not to be disputed; and after she had
wrapt my Legs in Flannel almost three Months, she came
and told me the Sloop was ready, and all the Goods put
on Board: And now, my Dear, says she, I come to tell you
all the rest of my Design; for added she, I hope you will
not think I am going to kidnap you, and transport you
from Virginia, as other People are transported to it, or
that I am going to get you sent away and leave myself in
Possession of your Estate; but you shall find me the same
faithful Creature, which I should have been if I had been
still your Slave, and not had any Hopes of being your
Wife, and that in all my Scheme which I have laid for
your Safety, in this new Exigence, I have not proposed
your going one Step but where I shall go, and be always
with you, to assist and serve you on all Occasions, and to
take my Portion with you, of what kind soever our Lot
may be.
Tmswas so generous, and so handsome a Declaration
of her Fidelity, and so great a Token too of the Goodness
of her Judgment, in considering of the Things which
were before her, and of what my present Circumstances
called for, that from that Time forward, I gave myself
chearfully up to her Management, without any Hesita-
tion in the least, and in about Ten Days Preparation,
we embark'd in a large Sloop of my own of about 60
Tun.
I SHOulDhavemention'd here, that I had still my faith-
ful Tutor (as I called him) at the Head of my Affairs, and
as he knew who to correspond with, and how to manage
the Correspondence in England, we left all that Part to
him, as I had done before; and I did this with a full Satis-
faction in his Ability as well as in his Integrity, it is true,
he had been a little shagreen'd in that Affair of my Wife,
who, as I hinted before, had married me, after telling
him, in Answer to his Solicitations, that she had a Hus-
band alive.
Now tho' this was litterally true, yet as it was a Secret
not fit to be open'd to him, I was obliged to put him off
with other Reasons, as well as I could, perhaps not much
to the Purpose, and perhaps not much to his Satisfaction;
so that I reckon'd he look'd on himself as not very kindly
used several Ways.
But he began to get over it, and to be easy, especially
at our going away, when he found that the Trust of every
Thing was still left in his Hands, as it was before.
When my Wife had thus communicated every Thing
of the Voyage to me, and we began to be ready to go off,
she came to me one Morning, and with her usual Chear-
fulness told me, she now came to tell me the rest of her
Measures for the compleating my Deliverance, and this
was, that while we made this Trip as she call'd it, to the
hot Springs at Nevis, she would write to a particular
Friend at London, who she could depend upon, to try to
get a Pardon for a Person on Account of the late Rebel-
lion, with all the Circumstances which my Case was at-
tended with, viz. of having acted nothing among them,
but being three Days in the Place, and while we were thus
absent, she did not question but to have an Answer, which
she would direct to come so many Ways, that we would
be sure to have the first of it, as soon as it was possible the
Vessels could go and come; and in the mean Time the
Expence should be very small, for she would have an An-
swer to the grand Question first, Whether it could be ob-
tain'd or no? And then an Account of the Expence of it,
that so I might judge for myself, whether I would part
with the needful Sum or no, before any Money was dis-
bursed on my Account.
Icould not but be throughlysatisfy'dwithher Contriv-
ance in this particular, and I had nothing to add to it, but
that I would not have her limit her Friend so strictly, but
that if he saw the Way clear, and that he was sure to ob-
tain it, he should go through stitch with it, if within the
Expence of two, or three, or four Hundred Pounds, and
that upon Advice of its being practicable, he should have
Bills payable by such a Person on Delivery of the War-
rant for the Thing.
To fortify this, I enclosed in her Packet a Letter to one
of my Correspondents, who I could particularly trust,
with a Credit for the Money, on such and such Condi-
tions ; but the Honesty and Integrity of my Wife's Cor-
respondence was such, as prevented all the Expence, and
yet I had the wish'd for Security as if it had been all paid,
as you shall hear presently.
All these Things being fix'd to our Minds, and all
Things left behind in good Posture of Settlement as
usual, we embark'd together and put to Sea, having the
Opportunity of an English Man of War being on the Coast
in Pursuit of the Pyrates, and who was just then standing
away towards the Gulph of Florida, and told us he would
see us safe as far as New-Providence, or the Bahama Is-
lands.
And now having fair Weather and a pleasant Voyage,
and my Flannels taken off of my Legs, I must hint a little
what Cargo I had with me, for as my Circumstances were
very good in that Country, so I did not go such a Voyage
as this, and with a particular Reserve of Fortunes what-
ever might afterward happen, without a sufficient Cargo
for our Support, and whatever Exigence might happen.
Our Sloop, as I said, was of about 60 or 70 Ton, andas
Tobacco, which is the general Produce of the Country,
was no Merchandize at Nevis, that is to say, for a great
Quantity, so we carried very little, but loaded the Sloop
with Corn, Pease, Meal, and some Barrels of Pork, and
an excellent Cargo it was, most of it being the Produce of
my own Plantation; we took also a considerable Sum of
Money with us in Spanish Gold, which was as above, not
for Trade, but for all Events: I also order'd another Sloop
to be hir'd, and to be sent after me loaden with the same
Goods, as soon as they should have Advice from me that
I was safe arriv'd.
We came to the Latitude of the Island of Antegua,
which was very near to that of Nevis, whether we intend-
ed to go, on the i8th Day after our passing the Capes of
Virginia, but had no sight of the Island, only our Master
said he was sure if he stood the same Course as he then
was, and the Gale held, I say he told me, he was sure he
should make the Island in less than five Hours sail; so he
stood on fair for the Islands: However his Account had
fail'd him, for we held on all the Evening, made no Land,
and likewise all Night, when in the grey of the Morning
we discover'd from the Top-mast Head, a Brigantine,
and a Sloop making Sail after us, at the Distance of about
six Leagues, fair Weather, and the Wind fresh at S. E.
Our Master soon understood what they were, and
came down into the Cabbin to me, to let me know it; I
was much surpriz'd you may be sure at the Danger, but
my poor Wife took me off of all the Concern for myself to
take Care of her, for she was frighted to that Degree, that
I thought we should not have been able to keep Life in
her.
Whi lEwe were thus underthe first Hurry and Surprize
of the Thing, suddenly another Noise from the Deck
call'd us up to look out, and that was Land, Land, the
Master and I, (for by this Time I had gotten out of my
Cabbin) run upon the Deck, and there we saw the State
of our Case very plain; the two Rogues that stood after us,
laid on all the Canvas they could carry, and crowded after
us amain; but at the Distance as I have said, of about six
Leagues, rather more than less, on the other Hand, the
Land discover'd lay about nine Leagues right a Head; so
that if the Pyrates could get of us, so as to sail three Foot
for our two, it was evident they would be up with us be-
fore we could make the Island, if not, we should escape
them and get in; but even then we had no great Hope to
do any more, than to run the Ship ashore to save our Lives,
and so stranding our Vessel, spoil both Sloop and Cargo.
When we were making this Calculation, our Master
came in chearfully, and told me he had crowded on more
Sail, and found the Sloop carried it very well, and that he
did not find the Rogues gain'd much upon us, and that
especially if one of them did not, that was the Sloop he
found he could go away from the Brigantine as he pleas-
ed : Thus we gave them what they call a stern Chase, and
they work'd hard to come up with us till towards Noon,
when on a sudden they both stood away, and gave us
over, to our great Satisfaction you may be sure.
We did not it seems so easily see the Occasion of our
Deliverance, as the Pyrate did, for while we went spoon-
ing away large with the Wind, foroneof the Islands, with
those two Spurs in our Heels, that is, with these two
Thieves at our Sterns: There lay an English Man of War
in the Road of Nevis, which was the other Island from
whence they espy'd the Pyrates, tho' the Land lying be-
tween, we could not see them.
As the Man of War discover'd them, she immediately
slip'd her Cable, and put herself under Sail in Chase of
the Rogues, and they as soon perceiv'd her, and being
Windward, put themselves upon a Wind to escape her;
and thus we were deliver'd, and in about an Hour more,
we knew who was our Deliverer, seeing the Man of War
stretch a Head clear of the Island, and stand directly after
the Pyrates, who now crowded from us as fast as they
crowded after us before, and thus we got safe into Anti-
gua, after the terrible Apprehension we had been in of be-
ing taken; our Apprehensions of being taken now, were
much more than they would have been on Board a loaden
Ship, from, or to London, where the most they ordinarily
do, is to rifle the Ship, take what is valuable and portable,
and let her go; but ours being but a Sloop, and all our
Loading being good Provisions, such as they wanted to
be sure, for their Ships Store; they would certainly have
carried us away, Ship and all, taken out the Cargo and the
Men, and perhaps have set the Sloop on Fire; so that as
to our Cargo of Gold it had been inevitably lost, and we
hurry'd away, no Body knows where, and used as such
barbarous Fellows are wont to use such innocent People
as fall into their Hands.
But we are now out of their Hands, and had the Satis-
faction a few Days after, to hear that the Man of War pur-
su'd them so close, notwithstanding they chang'd their
Course in the Night, that the next Day they were oblig'd
to separate, and shift for themselves; so the Man of War
took one of them, namely, the Brigantine, and carried her
into Jamaica, but the other, viz. the Sloop, made her
Escape.
Be1 ng arriv'd here, we presently dispos'd of our Cargo,
and at a tolerable good Price; and now the Question was,
what I should do next ? I look'd upon myself to be safe
here from the Fears I had been under of being discover'd
as a Rebel, and so indeed I was, but having been now ab-
sent five Months, and having sent the Sloop back with a
Cargo of Rum, and Melasses, such as I knew was want-
ing in my Plantations, I receiv'd the same Vessel back in
return, loaden as at first, with Provisions.
With this Cargo my Wife receiv'd a Packet from Lon-
don, from the Person who she had employ'd, (as above) to
solicit a Pardon, who very honestly wrote to her, that he
would not be so unjust to her Friend, whoever he was, as
to put him to any Expence for a private Solicitation; for
that he was very well assur'd that his Majesty had resolv'd,
from his own native Disposition to Acts of Clemency
and Mercy to his Subjects, to grant a general Pardon,
with some few Exceptions to Persons extraordinary, and
he hoped her Friend was none of the Extraordinary Per-
sons to be excepted.
Tmswas a kind of Life from the Dead to us both, and
it was resolv'd that my Wife should go back in the Sloop
directly to Virginia, where she should wait the good News
from England, and should send me an Account of it as
soon as she receiv'd it.
Accordingly she went back, and came safe with the
Sloop and Cargo to our Plantation, from whence, after
above four Months Expectation, behold! the Sloop came
to me again, but empty, and gutted of all her Cargo, ex-
cept about i00 Sacks of unground Malt, which the Py-
rates (not knowing how to Brew) knew not what to do
with, and so had left in her: However, to my infinite Satis-
faction, there was a Packet of Letters from my Wife,with
another to her from England, as well one from her Friend,
as one from my own Correspondent; both of them inti-
mating, that the King had sign'd an Act of Grace, that is
to say, a general free Pardon, and sent me Copies of the
Act, wherein it was manifest I was fully included.
And here let me hint, that having now, as it were, re-
vol. i1 i
ceiv'dmy Life at the Hands of King GEORGE, and in a
Manner so satifying as it was to me, it made a generous
Convert of me, and I became sincerely given in to the In-
terest of King GEORGE; and this from a Principle of
Gratitude, and a Sense of my Obligation to his Majesty
for my Life; and it has continu'd ever since, and will cer-
tainly remain with me as long as any Sense of Honour,
and of the Debt of Gratitude remains with me: I mention
this to hint how far in such Cases Justice, and Duty to
ourselves commands us; namely, that to those who gra-
ciously give us our Lives, when it is in their Power to take
them away; those Lives are a Debt ever after, and ought
to be set a-part for their Service, and Interest, as long as
any of the Powers of Life remain; for Gratitude is a Debt
that never ceases while the Benefit receiv'd remains; and
if my Prince has given me my Life, I can never pay the
Debt fully, unless such a Circumstance as this should
happen, that the Prince's Life should be in my Power,
and I as generously preserv'd it; and yet neither would
the Obligation be paid then, because the Cases would dif-
fer; thus, that my preserving the Life of my Prince was
my natural Duty, whereas the Prince on his Side (my Life
being forfeited to him) had no Motive but meer Clemen-
cy and Beneficence.
Perhaps this Principle may not please all that read it;
but as I have resolv'd to guide my Actions in Things of
such a Nature, by the Rules of strict Virtue and Principles
of Honour; so I must lay it down as a Rule of Honour,
that a Man having once forfeited his Life to the Justice of
his Prince, and to the Laws of his Country, and receiving
it back as a Bounty from the Grace of his Sovereign,
such a Man can never lift up his Hand again against
that Prince, without a Forfeiture of his Virtue, and an
irreparable Breach of his Honour and Duty, and deserves
no Pardon after it, either from God or Man; but all this
is a Digression, I leave it as a Sketch of the Laws of Hon-
our, printed by the Laws of Nature in the Breast of a Sol-
dier, or a Man of Honour, and which I believe all impar-
tial Persons, who understand what Honour means, will
subscribe to.
But I return now to my present Circumstances; my
Wife was gone, and with her, all my good Fortune, and
Success in Business, seem'd to have forsaken me; and I
had another Scene of Misery to go thro', after I had
thought that all my Misfortunes were over, and at an
End.
My Sloop, as I have told you, arriv'd, but having met
with a Pyrate Rogue, in the Gulph of Florida, they took
her first, then finding her Cargo to be all Eatables, which
they always want, they gutted her of all her Loading, ex-
cept (as I have said) about 100 Sacks of Malt, which they
really knew not what to do with; and which was still
worse, they took away all the Men, except the Master
and two Boys, who they left on Board, just to run the
Vessel into Antegoa, where they said they were bound.
BuTthe mostvaluable Part of my Cargo, viz. a Packet
of Letters from England, those they left, to my inexpres-
sible Comfort and Satisfaction; and particularly, that by
those, I saw my Way open to return to my Wife, and to
my Plantations, from which I promised myself never to
wander any more.
In order to this, I now embark'd myself, and all my
Effects on board the Sloop, resolving to sail directly to
the Capes of Virginia, my Captain beating it up to reach
the Bahama Channel, had not been two Days at Sea, but
we were overtaken with a violent Storm, which drove us
so far upon the Coast of Florida, as that we twice struck
upon the Shore, and had we struck a third Time, we had
been inevitably lost. A Day or two after that, the Storm
abating a little, wekeptthe Sea, but found the Wind blow-
ing so strong against our passing the Gulph, and the Sea
going so high, we could not hold it any longer; so we
were forced to bear away, and make what Shift we could;
in which Distress, the fifth Day after, we made Land, but
found it to be Cape the North West Part of the
Isle of Cuba: Here we found ourselves under a Necessity
to run in under the Land for Shelter, tho' we had not
come to an Anchor, so we had not touch'd the King of
Spain's Territories at all. However, in the Morning, we
were surrounded with five Spanish Barks, or Boats, such
as they call Barco Longos, full of Men; who instantly
boarded us, took us, and carry'd us into the Havana, the
most considerable Port belonging to the Spaniards in
that Part of the World.
HEREthe Sloop was immediately seiz'd, and in Conse-
quence plunder'd, as any one that knows the Spaniards,
especially in that Country, will easilyguess, our Men were
made Prisoners, and sent to the common Goal; and as for
myself, and the Captain, we were carry'd before the Al-
cade Major, or Intendant of the Place, as Criminals.
I spoke Spanish very well, having served under the
King of Spain in Italy, and it stood me in good stead at
this Time; for I so effectually argued the Injusticeof their
Treatment of me, that the Governor, or what I ought to
call him, frankly own'd they ought not to have stopp'd
me, seeing I was in the open Sea, pursuing my Voyage,
and offer'd no Offence to any Body, and had not landed,
or offer'd to land upon any Part of his Catholick Majesty's
Dominions, till I was brought in as a Prisoner.
It was a great Favour, that I could obtain thus much,
but I found it easier to obtain an Acknowledgment that I
had receiv'd Wrong, than to get any Satisfaction for that
Wrong, and much less was there any Hope or Prospect
of Restitution: And I was let know, that I was to wait, till
an Account could be sent to the Viceroy of Mexico, and
Orders could be received back from him, how to act in
the Affair.
I could easily foresee what all this tended to, namely,
to a Confiscation of the Ship and Goods, by the ordinary
Process atthe Place; andthatmy being left to the Decision
of the Viceroy of Mexico, was butapretended Representa-
tion of Things to him from the Corregidore or Judge of
the Place.
However, I had no Remedy, but the old insignificant
Thing, call'd Patience; and this I was better furnish'd
with, because I did not so much value the Loss as I made
them believe I did; my greatest Apprehensions were,
that they would detain me, and keep me as a Prisoner for
Life, and perhaps send me to their Mines in Peru, as they
have done many, and pretended to do to all that come on
Shore in their Dominions, howgreatsoevertheDistresses
may have been which have brought them thither, and
which has been the Reason why others, who have been
forc'd on Shore, have committed all manner of Violence
upon the Spaniards in their turn; resolving, however dear
they sold their Lives, not to fall into their Hands.
But I got better Quarter among them, than that too,
which was (as I have said) much of it owing to my speak-
ing Spanish, and to my telling them how I had fought in
so many Occasions in the Quarrel of his Ctf£&o/*V£ Majesty,
in Italy, and by great good Chance, I had the King of
France's Commission for Lieutenant Colonel, in the Irish
Brigade in my Pocket, where it was mention'd, that the
said Brigade was then serving in the Armies of France,
under the Orders of his Catholick Majesty in Italy.
I fA1l'd not to talk up the Gallantry and personal
Bravery of his Catholick Majesly, on all Occasions, and
particularly in many Battles, where (by the Way) his
MajesTy had never been at all, and in some, where I had
never been myself; but I found I talk'd to People who knew
nothing of the Matter, and so any Thing went down with
them, if it did but praise the King of Spain, and talk big
of the Spanish Cavalry, of which, God knows, there was
not one Regiment in the Army, at least while I was there.
However, this Way of managing myself, obtain'd me
the Liberty of the Place, upon my Parole, that I would
not attempt an Escape; and I obtain'd also, which was a
great Favour, to have 200 Pieces of Eight allow'd me out
of the Sale of my Cargo, for Subsistence, till I could nego-
tiate my Affairs at Mexico; as formy Men,they weremain-
tain'd as Prisoners, at the Publick Charge.
Well, after several Months Solicitation and Attend-
ance, all I could obtain was, the Satisfaction of seeing my
Ship and Cargo confiscated, and my poor Sailors in a fair
Way to be sent to the Mines: The last: I begg'd off, upon
Condition of paying 300 Pieces of Eight for their Ran-
som, and having them set on Shore at Antegoa, and myself
to remain Hostage for the Payment of the said 30oPieces
of Eight, and for 2 00 Pieces of Eight, which I had already
had,^and for 500 Pieces of Eight more for my own Ran-
som, if upon a Return from Mexico, the Sentence of Con-
fiscation, as above, should be confirm'd by the Vice-roy.
These were hard Articles indeed, but I was forced to
submit to them: Nor, as my Circumstances were above
all such Matters as these, as to Substance, did I lay it
much to Heart; the greatest Difficulty that lay in my
Way was, that I knew not how to correspond with my
Friends in any Part of the World, or which Way to sup-
ply myself with Necessaries, or with Money for the Pay-
ment I had agreed to: The Spaniards being so tenacious
of their Ports, that they allowed no Body to come on
Shore, or indeed near the Shore, from any Part of the
World, upon Pain of Seizure and Confiscation, as had
been my Case already.
UpoNthis Difficulty I begantoreason with theCorregi-
dore, and tell him, that he put Things upon us that were
impossible, and that were inconsistent with the Customs
of Nations; that if a Man was a Prisoner at Algiers, they
would allow him to write to his Friends to pay his Ran-
som, and would admit the Person that brought it to come
and go free, as a publick Person, and if they did not, no
Treaty could be carry'd on for the Ransom of a Slave,
nor the Conditions be perform'd when they are agreed
upon.
I BROUGHTit then down to my own Case, and desired to
know, upon Supposition, that I might, within the Time
limited in that Agreement, have the Sums of Money
ready for the Ransom of my Men, and of myself, how I
should obtain to have Notice given me of it? Or, how it
should be brought, seeing the very Persons bringing that
Notice, or afterwards presuming to bring the Money,
might be liable to be seiz'd and confiscated, as I had been,
and the Money itself be taken as a second Prize, without
redeeming the first.
Tho' this was so reasonable a Request, that it could not
be withstood, in point of Argument, yet the Spaniard
shrunk his head into his Shoulders, and said, they had not
Power sufficient to act in such a Case; that the King's
Laws were so severe against the suffering any Strangers
to set their Foot on his Catholick Majesty's Dominions in
America, and they could not dispense with the least Tittle
of them, without a particular Assiento, (as they called it)
from the Consulado, or Chamber of Commerce at Seville;
or, a Command under the Hand and Seal of the Viceroy
of Mexico.
How! Seignior Corregidore (said I) with some Warmth,
and, as it were, with Astonishment, have you not Author-
ity enough to sign a Passport for an Agent, or Ambassa-
dor, to come on Shore here, from any of the King of
Great-Britain's Governors in these Parts, under a white
Flag, or Flag of Truce, to speak with the Governor of
this Place, or with any other Person in the King's Name,
on the Subject of such Business as the Governor may
have to communicate? Why, said I, if you cannot do
that, you cannot act according to the Law of Nations.
He shook his Head, but still said No, he could not do
even so much as that; but here one of the Military Govern-
ors put in and oppos'd him, and they two differ'd warm-
ly; the first insisting that their Orders were deficient in
that Particular; but the other said, that as they were
bound up to them, it could not be in their Power to act
otherwise, and that they were answerable for the ill
Consequences.
Well then, says the Governor to the Corregidore, now
you have kept this Englishman as Hostage for the Ran-
som of the Men, that you have dismiss'd; suppose he
tells you, the Money is ready, either at such, or such, or
such a Place, How shall he bring it hither? You will take
all the People Prisoners that offer to bring it; What must
he do? If you say you will send and fetch it, What Securiy
shall he have, that he shall have his Liberty when it is
paid you? And why should he trust you so far, as to pay
the Money, and yet remain here a Prisoner?
Th1s carried so much Reason with it, that the Corregi-
dore knew not what to say; but that so was the Law, and
he could act no otherwise, but by the very Letter of it;
and here each was so positive, that nothing could deter-
mine it, but another Express to be sent to the Viceroy of
Mexico.
Upon this, the Governor was so kind, as to say he
would get me a Passport for any Body that should bring
the Money, and any Vessel they were in, by his own Au-
thority, and for their safe returning, and taking me with
them, provided I would answer for it, that they should
bring no European, or other Goods whatever with them,
and should not set Foot on Shore without his express
Permission, and provided he did not receive Orders to
the contrary, in the mean Time, from any superior Hand,
and that even in such a Case, they should have Liberty to
go back freely from whence they came, under the Pro-
tection of a white Flag.
I bow'd very respectfully to the Governor, in token of
my acknowledging his Justice, and then presented my
humble Petition to him, that he would allow my Men to
take their own Sloop, that it should be rated at a certain
Value, and would be oblig'd they should bring Specie
on Board with them, and that they should either pay it for
the Sloop, or leave the Sloop again.
Then he enquired to what Country I would send them
for so much Money, and if I could assure him of the Pay-
ment; and when he understood it was no farther than to
Virginia, he seem'd very easy, and to satisfy the Corregi-
dore, who still stood off, adhering with a true Spanish Stiff-
ness to the Letter of the Law; the said Governor calls out
to me: Seignior, (says he) I shall make all this Matter easy
to you, if you agree to my Proposal; your Men shall have
the Sloop, on Condition you shall be my Hostage for her
Return; but they shall not take her as your Sloop, tho' she
shall in the Effect be yours, on the Payment of the Mo-
ney ; but you shall take two of my Men on Board with you
upon your Parole, for their safe Return, and when she re-
turns, she shall carry his Catholick Majesty's Colours, and
be enter'd as one of the Sloops belonging to the Havana;
one of the Spaniards to be Commander, and to be call'd
by such a Name as he should appoint.
This the Corregidore came into immediately, and said,
this was within the Letter of the King's Commanderie, or
Precept, upon Condition, however, that she should bring
no European Goods on Board. I desir'd it might be put in
other Words; namely, that she should bring no European
Goods on Shore: It cost two Days Debate between these
two, whether it should pass, that no European Goods
should be brought in the Ship, or brought on Shore; but
having found Means to intimate, that I meant not to
Trade there, but would not be tied from bringing a small
Present to a certain Person, in acknowledgement of Fa-
vours; I say, after I had found Room to place such a Hint
right, where it should be plac'd, I found it was all made
easy to me, and it was all agreed presently, that after the
Ransom was paid, and the Ship also bought, it was but
reasonable, that I should have Liberty to Trade to any
other Country, not in the Dominions'of the Kingof Spain,
so to make up my Losses; and that it would be hard to
oblige my Men to bring away the Vessel light, and so
lose the Voyage, and add so much to our former Misfor-
tunes ; that so long as no Goods were brought on Shore in
the Country belonging to his Catholick MajesTy's Do-
minions, which was all that they had to defend, that the
rest was no Business of theirs.
Now I began to see my Way thro' this unhappy Busi-
ness, and to find, that as Money would bring me out of it,
so Money would bring it to turn to a good Account an-
other Way; wherefore I sent the Sloop away under Span-
ish Colours, and call'd her the Nueslra Segniora de la Val
de Grace, command by Seignior Giraldo de Nesma, one of
the two Spaniards.
With the Sloop I sent Letters to my Wife, and to my
chief Manager, with Orders to load her back, as I there
directed, viz. That she should have 200 Barrels of Flow-
er, 50 Barrels of Pease, and to answer my other Views, I
ordered i00 Bales to be made up of all Sorts of European
Goods, suchasnotmy own Ware-houses only would sup-
ply, but such as they could be supply'd with in other
Ware-houses, where I knew they had Credit for any
Thing.
In this Cargo I directed all the richest, and mosT: valu-
able English Goods they had, or could get, whether Lin-
nen, Woollen or Silk, to be made up; the coarser Things,
such as we use in Virginia, for cloathing of Servants, such
I ordered to be left behind, for the Use of the Plantation:
In less than seven Weeks Time the Sloop return'd, and I,
that fail'd not every Day to look out for her on the Strand,
was the firs! that spy'd her at Sea at a Distance, and knew
her by her Sails, but afterwards more particularly by her
Signals.
When she return'd, she came into the Road with her
Spanish Antient flying, and came to an Anchor, as direct-
ed; but I, that had seen her some Hours before, went di-
rectly to the Governor, and gave him an Account of her
being come, and fain I would have obtain'd the Favour to
have his Excellence (as I call'd him) go on Board in Per-
son, that he might see how well his Orders were execut-
ed; but he declin'd that, saying, he could not justify go-
ing off of the Island, which was, in short, to go out of his
Command of the Fort, which he could not re-assume
without a new Commission from the King's own Hand.
Then I ask'd Leave to go on Board myself, which he
granted me, and I brought on Shore with me the full sum
in Gold, which I had condition'd to pay for the Ransom,
both of my Men and myself, and for the Purchase of the
Sloop; and as I obtain'd Leave to land in a different Place,
so my Governor sent his Son with six Soldiers, to receive
and convey me with the Money to the Castle, where he
commanded, and therein to his own House: I had made
up the Money in heavy Parcels, as if it had been all Silver,
and gave it to two of my Men, who belong'd to the Sloop,
with Orders to them, that they should make it seem, by
their carrying it, to be much heavier than it was; this was
done to conceal three Parcels of Goods, which I had
pack'd up with the Money, to make a Present to the Go-
vernor, as I intended.
When the Money was carried in, and laid down on a
Table, my Governor order'd the Men to withdraw, and I
gave the Soldiers each of them a Piece of Eight to drink,
for which they were very thankful, and the Governor
seem very well pleas'd with it also: Then I ask'd him plea-
santly if he would please to receive the Money, he said no,
he would not receive it, but in Presence of the Corregidorey
and the other People concern'd; then I begg'd his Excel-
lency (as I call'd him) to give me Leave to open the Par-
cels in his Presence, for that I would do myself the Hon-
our to acknowledge his Favours in the best Manner I
could.
He told me no, he could not see any Thing be brought
on Shore, but the Money; but if I had brought anyThing
on Shore for my own Use, he would not be so sTricl: to en-
quire into that, so I might do what I pleas'd myself.
Upon that I went into the Place, shut myself in, and
having open'd all the Things, and placed them to my
Mind: There was five little Parcels, as follows,
i, 2. A Piece of 20 Yards fine English Broad-Cloth, 5
Yards of Black, 5 Yards of Crimson, in one Par-
cel, and the rest of fine Mixtures in another Par-
cel.
3. A Piece of 30 Ells of fine Holland Linnen.
4. A Piece of 18 Yards of fine English brocaded Silk.
5. A Piece of black Colchesler Bays.
After I had plac'd these by themselves, I found Means
with some seeming Difficulties, and much Grimace, to
bring him to know that this was intended for a Present to
himself: After all that Part was over, and he had seem'd
to accept them, signified, after walking a hundred Turns-
>
and more in the Room by them, by throwing his Hat,
which was under his Arm, upon them, and making a very
stiff Bow, I say, after this, he seem'd to take his Leave of
me for a while, and I waited in an outer Room, when I
was call'd in again; I found that he had look'd over all the
Particulars, and caus'd them to be remov'd out of the
Place.
But when I came again, I found him quite another
Man; he thank'd me for my Present, told me, it was a
Present fit to be given to a Viceroy of Mexico, rather than
to a meer Governor of a Fort, that he had done me no
Services suitable to such a Return, but that he would see
if he could not oblige me farther before I left the Place.
After our Compliments were over, I obtain'd to have
the Corregidore sent for, who accordingly came, and in
his Presence the Money, stipulated for the Ransome of
the Ship, and of the Men, was paid.
But here the Corregidore shew'd that he would be as
severely just on my Side, as on theirs, for he would not
admit the Money as a Ransom for us as Prisoners, but as
a Deposite for so much as we were to be ransom'd for, if
the Sentence for our being made Prisoners should be con-
firm'd.
And then the Governor and Corregidore joining to-
gether, sent a Representation of the whole Affair, at least
we were told so, to the Viceroy of Mexico; and it was pri-
vately hinted to me, that I would do well to stay for the
Return of the Aviso, that is, a Boat which they send over
the Bay to Vera Cruz, with an Express to Mexico, whose
Return is generally perform'd in two Months.
I was not unwilling to stay, having secret Hints given
me, that I should find some Way to go with my Sloop to-
wards Vera Cruiz myself, where I might have an Occa-
sion to Trade privately for the Cargo which I had on
Board; but it came about a nearer Way, for about two
Days after this Money being deposited, (as above) the
Governor's Son invited himself on Board my Sloop, where
I told him I would be very glad to see him, and whither
at the same Time he brought with him three considerable
Merchants, Spaniards, two of them not Inhabitants of
the Place.
When they were on Board, they were very merry and
pleasant, and I treated them so much to their Satisfaction,
that in short, they were not well able to go on Shore for
that Night, but were content to take a Nap on some Car-
pets which I caus'd to be spread for them, and that the
Governor's Son might think himself well us'd, I brought
him a very good Silk Night-Gown, with a Crimson Vel-
vet Cap to lie down in, and in the Morning desir'd him to
accept of them for his use, which he took very kindly.
Du ri ng that merry Evening, one of the Merchants not
so touch'd with Drink as the young Gentleman, nor so, as
not to mind what it was he came about, takes an Occasion
to withdraw out of the great Cabbin, and enter into a Par-
ley with the Master of the Sloop, in order to Trade for
what European Goods we had on Board; the Master took
the Hint, and gave me Notice of what had pass'd, and I
gave him Instructions what to say, and what to do; ac-
cording to which Instructions, they made butfew Words,
for about 5000 Pieces of Eight, and carried the Goods
away themselves, at and their own Hazards.
This was very agreeable to me, for now I began toseel
should lick myself whole, by the Sale of this Cargo, and
should make myself full amends of Jack Spaniard, for all
the Injuries he had done me in the first of these Things;
with this View I gave my Master, or Captain of the Sloop,
Instructions for Sale of all the rest of the Goods, and left
him to manage by himself, which he did so well, that he
sold the whole Cargo the next Day to the three Spaniards,
with this additional Circumstance, that they desir'd the
Sloop might carry the Goods, as they were on Board, to
such Part of the Terra Firma, as they should appoint be-
tween the Honduras and the Coast of La Vera Cruiz.
It was difficult for me to make good this Part of the
Bargain, but finding the Price agreed for would very well
answer the Voyage, I consented; but then how to send
the Sloop away, and remain among the Spaniards, when I
was now a clear Man, this was a Difficulty too, as it was
also to go away, and not wait for a favourable Answer
from the Viceroy of Mexico, to the Representation of the
Governor and the Corregidore\ however, at lasT: resolv'd
to go in the Sloop, fall out what would, so I went to the
Governor, and represented to him, that being now to ex-
pect a favourable Answer from Mexico, it would be a great
Loss to me to keep the Sloop there all the while, and I de-
sir'd his Leave for me to go with the Sloop to Antegoa, to
sell and dispose of the Cargo, which he well knew I was
oblig'd not to bring on Shore there at the Havana, and
which would be in Danger of being spoil'd by lying so
long on Board.
This I obtain'd readily, with License to come again in-
to the Road, and (for myself only) to come on Shore, in
order to hear the Viceroy's Pleasure in my Case, which
was depending.
Having thus obtain'd a License at, or Passport for the
Sloop and myself, I put to Sea with the three Spanish Mer-
chants on Board with me; they told me, they did not live
at the Havana, but it seems one of them did; and some
rich Merchantsjof the Havana, or of the Parts thereabouts
in the same Island, were concern'd with them; for they
brought on Board, that Night we put to Sea, a great Sum
of Money in Pieces of Eight, and, as I understood after-
wards, that these Merchants bought the Cargo of me,
and tho' they gave me a very great Price for every Thing,
yet that they sold them again to the Merchants, who they
procur'd on the Coast of La Vera Cruiz, at a prodigious
Advantage; so that they got above a Hundred per Cent,
after I had gain'd very sufficiently before.
We sail'd from the Havana directly for Vera Cruiz, I
scrupled venturing into the Port at first, and was very un-
easy, least I should have another Spanish Trick put upon
me; but as we sail'd under Spanish Colours, they shew'd
us such authentick Papers from the proper Officers, that
there was no Room to fear any Thing.
However, when we came in Sight of the SpanishCo&ii,
I found that they had a secret*clandestine Trade to carry
on, which tho' it was secret, yet they knew the Way of it
so well, that it was but a meer Road to them. The Case was
this, we stood in close under Shore in the Night, about six
Leagues to the North of the Port, where two of the three
Merchants went on Shore in the Boat, and in three Hours,
or thereabouts, they came on Board again with five Ca-
noes, and seven or eight Merchants more with them, and
as soon as they were on Board, we stood off to Sea, so that
by Day-light we were quite out of Sight of Land.
I ought to have mention'd before, that as soon as we
were put to Sea from the Havana, and during our Voyage
into the Gulph of Mexico, which was eight Days, we rum-
vol. u k
ag'd the whole Cargo, and opening every Bale, as far as
the Spanish Merchants desired, we trafficked with them for
the whole Cargo, except the Barrels of Flower and Pease.
Th1s Cargo was considerable in itself, for my Wife's
Account, or Invoyce, drawn out by my Tutor, and Man-
ager, amounted to 2684 /. 10 s. and I sold the whole, in-
cluding what had been sold in the Evening, when they
were on Board first, (as I have said) for 38593 Pieces of
Eight, and they allow'd me 1200 Pieces of Eight for the
Freight of the Sloop, and made my Master and the Sea-
men very handsome Presents besides, and they were well
able to do this too, as you shall hear presently.
After we were gotten out of Sight of Land, the Spani-
ardsfell to their Traffick, and our three Merchants open'd
their Shop, as they might say, for it was their Shop; as to
me, I had nothing to do with it, or with their Goods, they
drove their Bargain in a few Hours, and at Night we stood
in again for the Shore, when the five Canoes carry'd a
great part of the Goods on Shore, and brought the Money
back in Specie, as well for that they carry'd as for all the
rest, and at their second Voyage carry'd all away clear,
leaving me nothing on Board but my Barrels of Flower
and Pease, which they bad me Money for too, but not so
much as I expected.
Here I found that my Spanish Merchants made above
70000 Pieces of Eight of the Cargo I had sold them, up-
on which, I had a great Mind to be acquainted with those
Merchants on the Terra Firma, who were the last Custo-
mers, for it presently occurr'd to me, that I could easily
go with a Sloop from Virginia, and taking a Cargo direct-
ed on Purpose from England, of about 5 or 6000/. I might
easily make four of one; with this View I began to make a
kind of an Acquaintance with the Spaniards which came
in the Canoes, and we became so intimate, that at last,
with the Consent of the three Spaniards of the Havana, I
accepted an Invitation on Shore to their House, which
was a little Villa, or rather Plantation, where they had an
Ingenio, that is to say, a Sugar-house, or Sugar-Work, and
there they treated us like Princes.
iTOOKOccasion at this Invitation to say, that if I knew
how to find my Way thither again, I could visit them once
or twice a Year, very much to their Advantage and mine
too: One of the Spaniards took the Hint, and taking me
into a Room by myself, Seignior, says he, if you have any
Thoughts of coming to this Place again, I shall give you
such Directions as you shall be sure not to mistake, and
upon either coming on Shore in the Night, and coming
up to this Place, or, upon making the Signals which we
shall give you, we will not fail to come off to you, and
bring Money enough for any Cargaison, so they call it,
that you shall bring.
iTOOKall their Directions, took their Paroles of Hon-
our for my Safety, and without taking any Notice to my
first three Merchants, laid up all the rest in my most se-
cret Thoughts, resolving to visit them again in as short a
Time as I could; and thus, having in about five Days fin-
ished all our Merchandizing, we stood off to Sea, and
made for the Island of Cuba, where I set my three Spani-
ards on Shore with all their Treasure, to their Hearts Con-
tent, and made the best of my Way to Antigua, where with
all the Dispatch I could, I sold my 200 Barrels of Flower,
which however, had suffer'd a little, by the length of the
Voyage, and having laden the Sloop with Rum, Molasses,
and Sugar, I set Sail again for the Havana.
I was now uneasy indeed, for Fear of the Pyrates, for I
was a rich Ship, having besides Goods, near 40000 Pieces
of Eight in Silver.
When I came back to the Havana, I went on Shore to
wait on the Governor and the Corregidore, and to hear
what Return was had from the Viceroy, and had the good
Fortune to know that the Viceroy had disallow'd that
Part of the Sentence which condemn'd us as Prisoners,
and put a Ransom on us, which he insisted could not be,
but in Time of open War; but as to the Confiscation, he
deferr'd it to the Chamber or Council of Commerce at
Sevil, and the Appeal to the King if such be preferr'd.
This was in some Measure, avery good Piece of Justice
in the Viceroy, for as we had not been on Shore, we could
not be legally imprison'd; and for the rest, I believe if I
would have given myself the Trouble to have gone to old
Spain, and have preferr'd my Claim to both the Ship and
the Cargo, I had recover'd them also.
HowEVERas it was, I was now a free Man without Ran-
som, and my Men were also free, so that all the Money
which I had deposited, as above, was return'd me; and
thus I took my Leave of the Havana, and made the best
of my Way for Virginia, where I arriv'd after a Year and a
half Absence, and notwithstanding all my Losses, came
Home above 4000 Pieces of Eight richer than I went out.
As to the old Affair about the Preslon Prisoners, that
was quite at an End,for the general Pardon past in Parlia-
ment made me perfectly easy, and I took no more Thought
about that Part: I might here very usefully observe, how
necessary and inseparable a Companion Fear is to Guilt;
it was but a few Months that the Face of a poor Predion
Transport, would have frighted me out of my Wits; to
avoid them I fain'd myself sick, and wrapt my Legs in
Flannel, as if I had the Gout, whereas now, they were no
more Surprize to me, nor was I any more uneasy to see
them, than I was to see any other of the Servants of the
Plantations.
And that which was more particular than all was, that
tho' before I fancied every one of them would know me,
and remember me, and consequently betray and accuse
me; now, tho' I was frequently among them, and saw
most of them, and if not all of them, one Time or other,
nay, tho' I remember'd several of their Faces, and even
some of their Names, yet there was not a Man of them
that ever took the least Notice of me, or of having known
or seen me before.
It would have been a singular Satisfaction to me, if I
could have known so much as this of them before, and
had saved me all the Fatigue, Hazard, and Misfortune
that befell me afterwards; but Man, a short sighted Crea-
ture, sees so little before him, that he can neither antici-
pate his Joys, nor prevent his Disasters, be they ever so
little a Distance from him.
I had now my Head full of my Wesl-India Project, and
I began to make Provision for it accordingly; I had a full
Account of what European Goods were most acceptable
in New Spain, and to add to my Speed, I knew that the
Spaniards were in great want of European Goods; the
Galleons from Old Spain having been delay'd to an un-
usual length of Time, for the two Years before: Upon
this Account, having not Time, as I thought, to send to
England for a Cargo of such Goods as were most proper;
I resolv'd to load my Sloop with Tobacco and Rum, the
last I brought from Antigua, and go away to Boslon in New
England, and to New-York, and see if I could pick up a
Cargo to my Mind.
AccoRDiNGlYltook 20000 Pieces of Eight in Money,
and my Sloop laden as above, and taking my Wife with
me, we went away; it was an odd and new Thing at New-
England, to have such a quantity of Goods bought up there
by a Sloop from Virginia, and especially to be paid for in
ready Money, as I did for most of my Goods; and this set
all the Trading Heads upon the Stretch, to enquire what,
and who I was, to which they had an immediate and di-
rect Answer, that I was a very considerable Planter in Vir-
ginia, and that was all, any of my Men on Board the Sloop
could tell of me, and enough too.
Well, it was the Cause of much Speculation among
them, as I heard at second and third Hands; some said,
he is certainly going to Jamaica, others said, he is going
to Trade with the Spaniards; others, that he is going to
the South-Sea, and turn half Merchant, half Pyrate, on
the Coast of Chily and Peru; some one Thing, some an-
other, as the Men Gossips found their Imaginations di-
rected: But we went on with our Business, and laid out
i2000 Pieces of Eight, besides our Cargo of Rum and
Tobacco, and went from thence to New-York, where we
laid out the rest.
The chief of the Cargo we bought here was, fine Eng-
lish Broad Cloth, Serges,Druggets, Norwich Stuffs, Bays,
Says, and all kinds of Woollen Manufactures, as also Lin-
nen of all sorts, a very great Quantity, and near a i ooo /.
in fine Silks, of several Sorts.
Being thus freighted, I came back safe to Virginia, and
with very little Addition to my Cargo, began to prepare
for my Wesl-India Voyage.
I should have mention'd, that I had built upon my
Sloop, and raised her a little, so that I had made her carry
12 Guns, and fitted her up for Defence, for I thought she
should not be attack'd and Boarded by a few Spanish Barco
Longos, as she was before; and I found the Benefit of it
afterwards, as you shall hear.
We set Sail the beginning of Augusl, and as I had twice
been attack'd by Pyrates in passing the Gulph of Florida,
or among the Bahama Islands, I resolv'd, tho' it was far-
ther about to stand off to Sea, and so keep as I believ'd it
would be, out of the Way of them.
We passed the Tropick as near as we could guess, just
where the famous Sir William Phipps fish'd up the Silver
from the Spanish Plate Wreck, and standing in between
the Islands, kept our Course W. by S. keeping under the
Isle of Cuba, and so running away, Trade, as they call it,
into the great Gulph of Mexico, leaving the Island of Ja-
maica to the S. and S. E. by this Means avoiding, as I
thought, all the Spaniards of Cuba, or the Havana.
As we passed the West Point of Cuba, three Spanish
Boats came off to Board us, as they had done before, on
the other Side of the Island; but they found themselves
mistaken, we were too many for them, for we run out our
Guns, which they did not perceive before, and firingthree
or four Shot at them, they retir'd.
The next Morning they appear'd again, being five
large Boats and a Bark, and gave us Chase; but we then
spread our Spanish Colours, and brought too to fight
them, at which they retir'd, so we escaped this Danger by
the Addition of Force which we had made to our Vessel.
We now had a fair run for our Port, and as I had taken
very good Directions, I stood away to the North of St.
John d'Ulva, and then running in for the Shore, found
the Place appointed exactly, and going on Shore, I sent
the Master of my Sloop directly to the Ingenio, where he
found the Spanish Merchant at his House, and where he
dwelt like a little Sovereign Prince, who welcom'd him,
and understanding that I was in a particular Boat at the
Creek, as appointed, he came immediately with him, and
bringing another Spaniard from a Villa not far off, in
about four Hours they were with me.
They would have perswaded me to go up to their
Houses, and have staid there till the next Night, ordering
the Sloop to stand off as usual, but I would notconsentto
let the Sloop go to Sea without me, so we went on Board
directly, and as the Night was almost run, stood off to Sea,
so by Day-break we were quite out of Sight of Land.
Here we began, as I said before, to open Shop, and I
found the Spaniards were extreamly surpriz'd at seeing
such a Cargo, I mean so large, for in short, they had cared
not if it had been four Times as much: They soon ran
thro' the Contents of all the Bales we open'd that Night,
and with very little Dispute about the Price they approv'd,
and accepted all that I show'd them; but as they said,
they had not Money for any greater Parcel, they agreed
to go on Shore the next Evening for more Money.
However, we spent the Remainder of the Night in
looking over and making Inventories, or Invoyces of the
rest of the Cargo, that so they might see the Goods, know
the Value, and knowwhatmore Moneythey had to bring.
Accordingly, in the Evening we stood in for the Shore,
and they carried Part of the Cargo with them, borrowing
the Sloop's Boat to assist them, and after they had lodg'd
and landed the Goods, they came on Board again, bring-
ing three of the other Merchants with them, who were
concern'd before, and Money enough to clear the whole
Ship, ay, and Ship and all, if I had been willing to sell her.
To give them their due, they dealt with me like Men
of Honour; they were indeed sensible that they bought
every Thing much cheaper of me, than they did before of
the three Merchants of the Havana; these Merchants
having been as it were the Hucksters, and bought them
first of me, and then advanc'd,aslhave said, above i00
per Cent, upon the Price they gave me; but yet at the same
Time I advanc'd in the Price much more now, than I did
before to the said Spaniards, nor was it without Reason,
because of the length and risque of the Voyage, both out
and Home, which now lay wholly upon me.
I n short, I sold the whole Cargo to them, and for which
I receiv'd near 200,000 Pieces of Eight in Money, be-
sides which, when they came on Board the second Time,
they brought all their Boats loaden with fresh Provisions,
Hogs, Sheep, Fowls, Sweetmeats, &c. enough for my
whole Voyage, all which they made a Present to me of,
and thus we finish'd our Traffick to our mutual Satisfac-
tion, and parted with Promises of farther Commerce, and
with Assurances on their Part of all Acts of Friendship
and Assistance, that I could desire, if any Disaster should
befal me in any of these Adventures; asindeed was not im-
probable, considering the Strictness and Severity of their
Customs, in case any People were taken Trading upon
their Coast.
I immediatelycall'd a Council with my little Crew,
which Way we should go back; the Mate was for beating
it up to Windward, and getting up to Jamaica, but as we
were too rich to run any Risques, and were to take the
best Course to get safe Home, I thought, and so did the
Master of the Sloop, that our best Way was to Coast
about the Bay, and keeping the Shore oi Floridaon Board,
make the shortest Course to the Gulph, and so make for
the Coast of Carolina, and to put in there into the first
Port we could, and wait for any English Men of War that
might be on the Coast to secure us to the Capes.
This was the best Course we could take, and prov'd
very safe to us, excepting that about the Cape of Florida,
and on the Coast in the Gulph, till we came to the height
of St. Augusline; we were several Times visited with the
Spaniards Barco Longos, and small Barks, in Hopes of
making a Prize of us; but carrying Spanish Colours, de-
ceiv'd most of them, and a good Tire of Guns kept the
rest at a Distance, so that we came safe, tho' once or twice
in Danger of being run on Shore by a Storm of Wind; I
say, we came safe into Charles River in Carolina.
From hence I found Means to send a Letter Home,
with an Account to my Wife of my good Success, and
having an Account that the Coast was clear of Pyrates,
tho' there were no Men of War in the Place, I ventur'd
forward, and in short, got safe into the Bay of Chesapeak,
that is to say, within the Capes of Virginia, and in a few
Days more to my own House, having been absent three
Months and four Days.
NEVERdid any Vessel on this Side the World make a
better Voyage in so short a Time, than I made in this
Sloop, for by the most moderate Computation, I clear'd
in these three Months 25000 /. Sterling in ready Money,
all the Charges of the Voyage to New-England also being
reckon'd up.
Now was my Time to have sat still contented with what
I had got, if it was in the Power of Man to know when his
good Fortune was at the highest, and more, my prudent
Wife gave it as her Opinion, that I should sit down satis-
fy'd, and push the Affair no farther, and earnestly per-
swaded me to do so; but I that had a Door open, as I
thought, to immense Treasure, that had found the Way
to have a Stream of the Golden Rivers of Mexico flow into
my Plantation of Virginia, and saw no Hazards, more
then what was common to all such Things in the Prose-
cution; I say to me, these Things look'd with another
Face, and I dream'd of nothing but Millions, and Hun-
dred of Thousands; so contrary to all moderate Measures,
I push'd on for another Voyage, and laid up a Stock of all
sorts of Goods that I could get together, proper for the
Trade: I did not indeed go again to New-England, for I
had by this Time a very good Cargo come from England,
pursuant to a Commission I had sent several Months be-
fore ; so that in short, my Cargo, according to the Invoyce
now made up, amounted to above 10000 /. Sterling first
Cost, and was a Cargo so sorted, and so well bought, that
I expected to have advanc'd upon them much more in
proportion than I had done in the Cargo before.
W1th these Expectations, we began our second Voy-
age in April, being about five Months after our Return
from the first; we had not indeed the same good Speed,
even in our Beginning, as we had at first, for tho' we stood
off to Sea about 60 Leagues, in order to be out of the Way
of the Pyrates, yet we had not been above five Days at
Sea, but we were visited and rifled by two Pyrate Barks,
who being bound to the Northward, that is to say, the
Banks of Newfoundland, took away all our Provisions,
and all our Ammunition, and small Arms, and left us ve-
ry ill provided to pursue our Voyage; and it being so near
Home,we thought it adviseable to come about, and stand
in for the Capes again, to restore our Condition, and furn-
ish ourselves with Stores of all kinds for our Voyage; this
took us up about ten Days, and we put to Sea again; as for
our Cargo, the Pyrates did not meddle with it, being all
Bale Goods,which they had no present Use for, and knew
not what to do with, if they had them.
We met with no other Adventure worth naming, till
by the same Course that we had steer'd before, we came
into the Gulph of Mexico, and the first Misfortune we met
with here was, that on the Back of Cuba, crossing towards
the Point of the Terra Firma, on the Coast of Jucatan, we
had Sight of the Flota of New-Spain, that is, of the Ships
which come from Carthagena or Porto Bello, and go to the
Havana, in order to pursue their Voyage to Europe.
They had with them one Spanish Man of War, and
three Frigats, two of the Frigats gave us chase, but it be-
ing just at the shutting in of the Day, we soon lost sight of
them, and standing to the North, cross the Bay of Mexico,
as if we were going to the Mouth of Missippi, they lost us
quite, and in a few Days more we made the bottom of the
Bay, being the Port we were bound for.
We stood in as usual, in the Night, and gave Notice to
our Friends, but instead of their former Readiness to
come on Board, they gave us Notice, that we had been
seen in the Bay, and that Notice of us was given at Vera
Cruz, and at other Places, and that several Frigats were
in Quest of us, and that three more would be cruizing the
next Morning in search for us.
We could not conceive how this could be; but we were
afterwards told, that those three Frigats, having lost Sight
of us in the Night, had made in for the Shore, and had
given the Alarm of us as of Privateers.
Be that as it would, we had nothing to do, but to con-
sider what Course to take immediately, the Spanish Mer-
chants Advice was very good if we had taken it, namely,
to have unladen as many of our Bails as we could that very
Night, by the Help of our Boat and their Canoes, and to
make the best of our Way in the Morning to the North of
the Gulph, and take our Fate.
This my Skipper or Master, thought very well of, but
when we began to put it in Execution, we were so confus-
ed, and in such a Hurry, being not resolv'd what Course
to take, that we could not get out above sixteen Bales of all
sorts of Goods, before it began to be too light, and we be-
hov'd to set Sail; at la&, the Master proposed a Medium,
which was, that I should go on Shore in the next Boat, in
which was five Bales of Goods more, and that I should
stay on Shore, if the Spanish Merchants would undertake
to conceal me, and let them go to Sea, and take their
Chance.
The Spanish Merchants readily undertook to protect
me, especially it being so easy to have me pass for a natur-
al Spaniard, and so they took me on Shore with 2i Bales
of my Goods, and the Sloop stood off to Sea; if they met
with any Enemies, they were to stand in for the Shore the
next Night, and we fail'd not to look well out for them,
but to no Purpose, for the next Day they were discovered
and chased by two Spanish Frigats; they stood from them,
and the Sloop being an excellent Sailor, gain'd so much,
that they would certainly have been clear of them when
Night came on, but a small Picaroon of a Sloop kept them
Company in spight of all they could do, and two or three
Times offer'd to engage them, thereby to give Time to
the rest to come up, but the Sloop kept her Way, and gave
them a Chase of three Days and Nights, having a fresh
Gale of Wind at S. W. till she made the Rio Grand, or as
the French call it, the Missippi, and there finding no
Remedy, they run the Vessel on Shore, not far from the
Fort, which the Spaniards call Pensacola, Garrison'd at
that Time with French; our Men would have enter'd the
River as a Port, but having no Pilot, and the Current of
the River being strong against them, the Sloop run on
Shore, and the Men shifted as well as they could in their
Boats.
I was now in a very odd Condition indeed, my Circum-
stances were in one Sense indeed very happy, namely,
that I was in the Hands of my Friends, for such really
they were, and so faithful, that no Men could have been
more careful of their own Safety, than were they of mine;
and that which added to the Comfort of my new Condi-
tion, was the Produce of my Goods, which were gotten
on Shore by their own Advice and Direction, which was a
Fund sufficient to maintain me with them as long as I
could be supposed to stay there; and, if not the first Mer-
chant to whose House I went, assured me, that he would
give me Credit for 20000 Pieces of Eight, if I had occa-
sion for it.
My greatest Affliction was, that I knew not how to
convey News to my Wife of my present Condition, and
how among the many Misfortunes of the Voyage, I was
yet safe, and in good Hands.
But there was no Remedy for this Part, but the great
universal Cure of all incurable Sorrows, viz. Patience,
and indeed I had a great deal of Reason, not for Patience
only, but Thankfulness, if I had known the Circumstances
which I should have been reduc'd to, if I had fallen
into the Hands of the Spaniards; the best of which that
I could reasonably have expected, had been, to have sent
to the Mines, or which was ten Thousand Times worse,
the Inquisition; or if I had escaped the Spaniards, as my
Men in the Sloop did, the Hardships they were exposed
to, the Dangers they were in, and the Miseries they suf-
fer'd, were still worse, in wandering among Savages, and
the more Savage French, who plunder'd and strip'd them,
instead of relieving and supplying them in their long
Wilderness Journey over the Mountains, till they reach'd
the S. W. Parts of South Carolina, a Journey which in-
deed deserves to have an Account to be given of it by it-
self; I say, all these Things had I known of them, would
have let me see that I had a great deal of Reason, not only
to be Patient under my present Circumstances, but satis-
fied, and thankful.
Here, as I said, my Patron the Merchant, entertain'd
me like a Prince, he made my Safety his peculiar Care,
and while we were in any Expectation of the Sloop being
taken, and brought into Vera Cruz, he kept me retir'd at
a little House in a Wood, where he kept a fine Avery of all
sorts of American Birds, and out of which he yearly sent
some as Presents to his Friends in Old Spain.
This Retreat was necessary, least if the Sloop should
be taken and brought into Vera Cruz, and the Men be
brought in Prisoners, they should be tempted to give an
Account of me as their Super-Cargo or Merchant, and
where both I and the 2i Bales of Goods were set on Shore;
as for the Goods, he made sure Work with them, for they
were all open'd, taken out of the Bales, and separated, and
being mix'd with other European Goods which came by
the Galeons, were made up in new Package, and sent to
Mexico in several Parcels, some to one Merchant, some to
another; so that it was impossible to have found them out,
even if they had had Information of them.
In this Posture, and in Apprehension of some bad
News of the Sloop, I remain'd at the Villa, or House in
the Vale, for so they call'd it, about five Weeks; I had two
Negroes appointed to wait on me, one of which was my
Purveyor, or my Cook, the other my Valet; and my
Friend, the Master of all, came constantly every Evening
to visit, and sup with me, when we walked out together
into the Avery, which was of its kind, the most beautiful
Thing that ever I saw in the World.
After above five Weeks Retreat of this kind, he had
good Intelligence of the Fate of the Sloop, viz. that the
two Frigats and a Sloop had chased her till she ran on
Ground near the Fort of Pensacola, that they saw her
strand'd and broke in Pieces by the Force of the Waves,
the Men making their Escape in their Boat. This News
was brought it seems, by the said Frigats to La Vera
Crux, where my Friend went on Purpose to be fully in-
form'd, and receiv'd the Account from one of the Cap-
tains of the Frigats, and discoursed with him at large
about it.
I was better pleased with the Loss of the Sloop and all
my Cargo, the Men being got on Shore and escaping,
than I should have been with the saving the whole Cargo,
if the Men had fallen into the Hands of the Spaniards,
for now I was safe, whereas then it being supposed they
would have been forced to some Discovery about me, I
must have fled, and should have found it very difficult to
have made their Escape, even with all that my Friends
could have done for me too.
But now I was perfectly easy, and my Friend, who
thought confining me at the House in the Vale, no longer
needful, brought me publickly Home to his Dwelling-
House, as a Merchant come from Old-Spain, by the last
Galeons, and who having been at Mexico, was come to re-
side with him.
Here I was dressed like a Spaniard of the better Sort,
had three Negroes to attend me, and was call'd Don Ferdi-
nand de Villa Moresa, in Caslilia Feja, that is to say, in
Old-Caslile.
Here I had nothing to do but to walk about, and ride
out into the Woods, and come Home again to enjoy the
pleasantest, and most agreeable Retirement in the World;
for certainly no Men in the World live in such Splendor,
and wallow in such immense Treasures as the Merchants
of this Place.
They live, as I have said, in a kind of Country Retreat
at their Villas, or as we would call them in Virginia, their
Plantations, and as they do call them, their Ingenios,vrhere
they make their Indigo, and their Sugars; but they have
also Houses, and Ware-houses, at Vera Cruz, where they
go twice a Year, when the Galeons arrive from Old-Spain,
and when those Galeons re-lade for their Return; and it
was surprizing to me, when I went to La Vera Cruz with
them, to see what prodigious Consignments they had
from their Correspondents in Old-Spain, and with what
Dispatch they manag'd them; for no sooner were the
Cases, Packs, and Bales of European Goods brought into
their Ware-houses, but they were open'd, and re-pack'd
by Porters and Packers of their own, that is to say, Ne-
vol. 11 1
groes and Indian Servants; and being made up into new
Bales, and separate Parcels, were all dispatch'd again, by
Horses for Mexico, and directed to their several Mer-
chants there, and the Remainder carry'd Home, as above,
to the Ingenio, where they liv'd, which was near 30 Eng-
lish Miles from Vera Cruz, so that in about 20 Days,
their Ware-houses were again entirely free: At La Vera
Crux, all their Business was over there, and they, and all
their Servants retir'd; for they stay'd no longer there than
needs must, because the unhealthiness of the Air.
After the Goods were thus dispatched, it was equally
surprizing, to see how soon, and with what Exactness,
the Merchants of Mexico, to whom those Cargoes were
separately consign'd, made the Return, and how it came
all in Silver or in Gold, so that their Warehouses in a few
Months, were piled up even to the Ceiling, with Chests
of Pieces of Eight, and with Bars of Silver.
It is impossible to describe in the narrow Compass of
this Work, with what Exactness and Order, and yet with
how little Hurry, and not the least Confusion, every
Thing was done, and how soon a Weight of Business of
such Importance and Value, was negotiated and finish'd,
the Goods re-pack'd, Invoyces made, and every Thing
dispatch'd and gone; so that in about five Weeks, all the
Goods they had receiv'd from Europe by the Galeons
were disposed of, and entered in their Journals, to the
proper Account of their Merchant, to whom they were
respectively consign'd; from thence they had Book-keep-
ers, who drew out the Invoyces, and wrote the Letters,
which the Merchant himself only read over, and sign'd,
and then other Hands copied all again into other Books.
I can give no Estimate of the Value of the several Con-
signments they receiv'd by that Flota; but I remember,
that when the Galeons went back, they shipp'd on Board
at several Times, one Million, three Hundred Thousand
Pieces of Eight in Specie, besides 180 Bales or Bags of
Cochoneal, and about 300 Bales of Indigo, but they were so
modest, that they said, this was for themselves and their
Friends; that is to say, the several Merchants of Mexico,
consign'd large Quantities of Bullion to them, to ship on
Board, and consign according to their Order; but then I
know also, that for all that, they were allow'd Commis-
sion, so that their Gain was very considerable, even that
Way also.
I had been with them at La Vera Cruz, and came back
again before we came to an Account for the Goods which
I had brought on Shore in the 21 Bales, which by the Ac-
count we brought them to, leaving a Piece of every Thing
to be govern'd by our last Market, amounted to 8570
Pieces of Eight, all which Money my Friend, for so I
must now call him, brought me in Specie, and caused his
Negroes to pile them up in one Corner of my Apartment;
so that I was indeed, still very rich, all Things consider'd.
There was a Bale which I had caused to be pack'dup
on purpose in Virginia, and which indeed, I had written
for from England, being chiefly of fine English Broad-
Cloths, Silk, Silk-Druggets, and fine Stuffs of several
kinds, with some very fine Hollands, which I set apart
for Presents, as I should find Occasion; and as what ever
Hurry I was in at carrying the 21 Bales of Goods on
Shore, I did not forget to let this Bale be one of them, so
when we came to a Sale for the rest, I told them that this
was a Pack with Cloaths and Necessaries for my own
wearing and Use, and so desired it might not be open'd
with the rest, which was accordingly observ'd, and that
Bale or Pack was brought into my Apartment.
This Bale was in general, made up of several smaller
Bales, which I had directed so that I might have Room
to make Presents, equally sorted as the Circumstance
might direct me: However, they were all considerable,
and I reckon'd the whole Bale cost me near 200 /. Sterling
in England; and tho' my present Circumstances requir'd
some Limits to my Bounty in making Presents, yet the
Obligation I was under, being so much the greater, espe-
cially to this one friendly generous Spaniard, I thought I
could not do better than by opening two of the smaller
Bales join them together, and make my Gift something
suitable to the Benefactor, and to the Respect he had
shewn me; accordingly I took two Bales, and laying the
Goods together, the Contents were as follows.
Two Pieces of fine English Broad-Cloth, the finest that
could be got in London, divided as was that which I
gave to the Governor at the Havana, into fine Crim-
son in Grain, fine light Mixtures, and fine Black.
Four Pieces of fine Holland, of 7 s. to 8 s. per Ell in
London.
Twelve Pieces of fine Silk Drugget and Duroys, for
Men's Ware.
Six Pieces of Broad Silks, 2 Damasks, 2 Brocaded
Silks and 2 Mantuas.
With a Box of Ribbons, and a Box of Lace, the last cost
about 40 /. Sterling in England.
This handsome Parcel I laid open in my Apartment,
and brought him up Stairs one Morning, on Pretence to
drink Chocolate with me, which he ordinarily did; when
as we drank Chocolate, and was merry, I said to him, tho'
I had sold him almost all my Cargo, and taken his Money,
yet the Truth was, that I ought not to have sold them to
him, but to have laid them all at his Feet, for that it was to
his Direction I ow'd the having any Thing sav'd at all.
He smil'd, and with a great deal of Friendship in his
Face told me, that not to have paid me for them, would
have been to have plunder'd a Shipwreck, which had been
worse than to have robb'd an Hospital.
A-rlast I told him, I had two Requests to make to him,
which must not be deny'd. I told him, I had a small Pre-
sent to make to him, which I would give him a Reason
why he should not refuse to accept: And the second Re-
quest I would make after the first was granted. He said
he would have accepted my Present from me, if I had not
been under a Disaster, but as it was, it would be cruel and
ungenerous. But, I told him, he was oblig'd to hear my
Reason for his accepting it: Then I told him, that this
Parcel was made up for him by Name, by my Wife and I
in Virginia, and his Name set on the Marks of the Bale,
and accordingly I shew'd him the Marks, which was in-
deed on one of the Bales, but I had doubled it now, (as
above) so that I told him these were his own proper Goods;
and in short, I press'd him so to receive them, that he
made a Bow, and I said no more, but order'd my Negroe,
that is to say, his Negroe that waited on me, to carry them
all, except the two Boxes, into his Apartments, but would
not let him see the Particulars, till they were all carry'd
away.
After he was gone, about a Quarter of an Hour, he
came in raving, and almost swearing, and in a great Pas-
sion, but I could easily see he was exceedingly pleased;
and told me, had he known the Particulars, he would
never have suffer'd them to have gone as he did, and at
last used the very same Compliment that the Governor at
the Havana used, viz. that it was a Present fit for a Vice-
roy of Mexico, rather than for him.
When he had done, he then told me, he remember'd I
had two Requests to him, and that one was not to be told
till after the first was granted, and he hoped now I had
something to ask of him, that was equal to the Obliga-
tion I had laid upon him.
I told him, I knew it was not the Custom in Spain,ior&
Stranger to make Presents to the Ladies, and that I would
not in the least doubt, but that whatever the Ladies of his
Family requir'd, as proper for their Use, he would appro-
priate to them as he thought fit. But that there was two
little Boxes in the Parcel, which my Wife with her own
Hand had directed to the Ladies; and I begg'd he would
be pleas'd with his own Hand to give them in my Wife's
Name as directed; that I was only the Messenger, but
that I could not be honest, if I did not discharge the Trust
repos'd my self of.
These were the two Boxes of Ribbands and Lace,
which knowing the Nicety of the Ladies in Spain, or ra-
ther of the Spaniards, about their Women, I had made
my Wife pack up, and direct with her own Hand, as I
have said.
He smil'd, and told me it was true, the Spaniards did
not ordinarily admit so much Freedom among the Wo-
men, as other Nations; but he hop'd (he said) I would not
think the Spaniards thought all their Women Whores, or
that all Spaniards were jealous of their Wives: That as to
my Present, since he had agreed to accept of it, I should
have the Direction of what Part I pleas'd to his Wife and
Daughters; for he had three Daughters.
Here I strain'd Courtisies again, and told him by no
Means, I would direct nothing of that kind, I only begg'd
that he would with his own Hand present to his Donna, or
Lady, the Present design'dthem by my Wife, and that he
would present it in her Name now living in Virginia. He
was extreamly pleas'd with the Nicety I us'd, and I saw
him present it to her accordingly, and could see at the
opening of it, that she was extreamly pleas'd with the
Present itself, as indeed she might very well be; for in
that Country it was worth a very considerable Sum of
Money.
Tho' I was us'd with an uncommon Friendship before,
and nothing could well be desir'd more, yet the grateful
Sense I shew'd of it, in the Magnificence of this Present,
was not lost, and the whole Family appear'd sensible of
it; so that I must allow that Presents, where they can be
made in such a Manner, are not without their Influence,
where the Persons were not at all mercenary, either be-
fore or after.
I had here now a most happy and comfortable Retreat,
tho' it was a kind of an Exile; here I enjoy'd every Thing
I could think of, that was agreeable and pleasant, except
only a Liberty of going Home, which, for that Reason,
perhaps, was the only Thing I desir'd in the World; for
the Grierof one absent Comfort is oftentimes capable of
imbittering all the other Enjoyments in the World.
Here I enjoy'd the Moments which I had never before
known how to employ, I mean, that here I learn'd to look
back upon a long ill-spent Life, bless'd with infinite Ad-
vantage, which I had no Heart given me till now to make
use of, and here I found just Reflections were the utmost
Felicity of human Life.
Here I wrote these Memoirs, having to add, to the
Pleasure of looking back with due Reflections, the Bene-
fit of a violent Fit of the Gout, which, as it is allow'd by
by most People, clears the Head, restores the Memory,
and qualifies us to make the most, and just, and useful
Remarks upon our own Actions.
Perhaps, when I wrote these Things down, I did not
foresee that the Writings of our own Stories would be so
much the Fashion in England, or so agreeable to others
to read, as I find Custom, and the Humour of the Times
has caus'd it to be; if any one that reads my Story, pleases
to make the same just Reflections, which I acknowledge
I ought to have made, he will reap the Benefit of my Mis-
fortunes, perhaps, more than I have done myself; 'tis
evident by the long Series of Changes, and Turns, which
have appear'd in the narrow Compass of one private mean
Person's Life, that the History of Men's Lives may be
i| many Ways made useful and instructing to those who
read them, if moral and religious Improvement, and Re-
| flections are made by those that write them.
There remains many Things in the Course of this un-
happy Life of mine, tho' I have left so little a Part of it to
speak of, that are worth giving a large and distinct Ac-
count of, and which give Room for just Reflections of a
Kind which I have not made yet; particularly, I think it
just to add how, in collecting the various Changes and
Turns of my Affairs, I saw clearer than ever I had done
before, how an invincible over-ruling Power, a Hand in-
fluenced from above, governs all our Actions of every
Kind, limits all our Designs, and orders the Events of
every Thing relating to us.
And from this Observation it necessarily occurr'd to
me, how just it was, that we should pay the Homage of all
Events to him; that as he guided, and had even made the
Chain of Causes, and Consequences, which Nature in
general strictly obey'd, so to him should be given the
Honour of all Events, the Consequences of those Causes,
as the first Mover, and Maker of all Things.
I who had hitherto liv'd, as might be truly said, with-
out God in the World, began now to see farther into all
those Things, than I had ever yet been capable of before,
and this brought me at last to look with Shame and
Blushes upon such a Course of Wickedness, as I had gone
through in the World: I had been bred indeed to nothing
of either religious, or moral Knowledge; what I gain'd of
either, was first by the little Time of civil Life which I
liv'd in Scotland, where my Abhorrence of the Wicked-
ness of my Captain and Comrade, and some sober religi-
ous Company I fell into, first gave me some Knowledge
of Good and Evil, and shew'd me the Beauty of a sober,
religious Life, tho' with my leaving that Country, it soon
left me too; or secondly, the modest Hints, and just Re-
flections of my Steward, who I call'd my Tutor, who was
a Man of sincere Religion, good Principles, and a real
true Penitent for his past Miscarriages: O! had I with
him sincerely repented of what was past, I had not for
24 Years together liv'd a Life of Levity, and profligate
Wickedness after it.
BuThere I had (as I said) Leisure to reflect, and to re-
pent, and to call to Mind Things past, and with a just De-
testation learn, as Jobsays, to abhor myself inDusl and Ashes.
ItIs with this Temper that I have written my Story, I
would have all (that design to read it) prepare to do so
with the Temper of Penitents; and remember, with how
much Advantage they may make their penitent Reflec-
tions at Home, under the merciful Dispositions of Provi-
dence in Peace, Plenty, and Ease, rather than Abroad,
under the Discipline of a Transported Criminal; as my
Wife and my Tutor, or under the Miseries and Distresses
of a Shipwreck'd Wanderer, as my Skipper, or Captain
of the Sloop, who (as I hear) died a very great Penitent,
labouring in the Deserts and Mountains to find his Way
Home to Virginia, by the Way of Carolina, whither the
resl of the Crew reached, after infinite Dangers and Hard-
ships ; or in Exile, however favourably circumslanciated
as mine, in absence from my Family, and for some Time
in no probable View of ever seeing them any more.
Such (I say) may Repent with Advantage; but how
few are they that seriously look in, till their Way ishedg'd
up, and they have no other Way to look?
Here (I say) I had Leisure to Repent, how far it pleases
God to give the Grace of Repentance where he gives the
Opportunity of it, is not for me to say of my self; it is suf-
ficient that I recommend it to all that read this Story, that
when they find their Lives come up in any Degree to any
Similitude of Cases, they will enquire by me, and ask
themselves, Is not this the Time to Repent? Perhaps the
Answer may touch them.
I have only to add to what was then written, that my
kind Friend the Spaniards finding no other Method pre-
sented for conveying me to my Hope, that is to say, to
Virginia, got a Licence for me to come in the next Galeons,
as a Spanish Merchant to Cadiz, where I arriv'd safe with
all my Treasure, for he suffer'd me to be at no Expences
in his House; and from Cadiz, I soon got my Passage on
Board an English Merchant Ship for London, from whence
I sent an Account of my Adventures to my Wife, and
where, in about five Months more, she came over to me,
leaving with full Satisfaction the Management of all our
Affairs in Virginia, in the same faithful Hands as before.
FINIS.
An Account of the Conduct
and Proceedings of the late
JOHN GOW
alias Smith
Captain of the late Pirates, executed for Murther and
Piracy, committed on Board the GEORGE GALLY, after-
wards call'd the REVENGE; with a Relation of all
the horrid Murthers they committed in
cold Blood; as also of their being
taken at the Islands of Orkney,
and sent up Prisoners
to London.
The Adventures ofCaptain John Gow,
one of the moil characlerislic of Defoe's minor writings, was
firslpublished as an oflavo pamphlet (pp. viii. and 62) by
J. Applebee, in Black Fryers, on June nth, i725. The
text, as here printed, has been carefully collated with the firsl
edition in the British Museum, and with the exception of afew
obvious printer's errors, which have been correcled, the spell-
ing andpuncluation of the original have been rigidlyfollowed.
INTRODUCTION
HO' this WorkseemsprincipallytoenterintotheHislory
of one Man, namely, The late Captain John Gow, alias
Smith, the Leader or Commander in the desperate and
bloody Anionsfor which he has been Condemn'd; yet the Share
which several others had in the whole Scene, and whoacledin
Concertwithhim, comes so necessarily to be Describ'd and takes
upsoMuchroomintheRelation, that it may indeed becaWdthe
Hislory of all the late Pirates so far as they afted together in
these wicked Adventures.
NOR does the calling him {I mean this Gow, or Smith)
their Captain, denominate him any thing deeper in the Crime
than the resl; for 'tis eminently known that among such Fel-
lows as these, when once they have abandon'd themselves to
such a dreadful height of Wickedness, there is so little Govern-
ment or Subordination among them, that they are, on occasion,
all Captains, all Leaders. And tho' they generally put in this
or that Man to acl as Commanderforthisor that Voyage or En-
terprise, they frequently remove them again upon the smallesl
Occasion, nay, even without any Occasion at all, but as Hu-
mours and Passions govern at those Times: And this is done so
often, that I once knew a Buccaneering Pirate Vessel, whose
Crew were upwards of 70 Men, who, in one Voyage, had so
often changed, set up, and pull'd down their Captains and
other Officers, that above Seven-and-Forty of the Ships Com-
pany had, at several Times, been in Office of one kind or other;
and among the resl they had, in particular, had i3 Captains.
NOW, however, itwasnotsohere;yetitseems,eveninthis
Ship, Gow himself, tho' call'd Captain, had not an absolute
Command; and was, at one time, so insulted by Lieutenant
Williams, because he declin'd Attacking a French ship from
Martinico, that it wanted but little of Deposing him at that
Time, and murthering him too.

i60 Captain John Gow
IN this Account, therefore, we shall have some Relation of
the Conducl of the whole Ships Crew, as well as of Captain
Gow; nor will it, I hope, make the Work the less Agreeable to
the Reader, but the more so, by how much the greater Variety
of Incidents will come in my way to speak of.
A S to Gow himself, he was, indeed, a Superlative, a Ca-
pital Rogue; and had been so even before he came to Embark
in this particular Ship. And he is more than ordinarily Re-
markable for havingformd the like Design of going a-Pirat-
ing when he serv'd as Boatswain on Board an English Mer-
chant Ship, Bound Home from Lisbon to London, in which
he formd a Party to have seiz'd on the Captain and Officers
and to run away with the Ship: When, no doubt, had he ac-
complish'd his Work, the said Captain and Officers had run
the same Fate as those did we are now to mention.
THISIam so ascertain'd of the Truth of, that the Cap-
tain himself is ready to Attesl it, to whom it was afterwards
discover'd, that he, Gow, had made four of the Seamen ac-
quainted with his bloody Design, and hadgain 'd them over to
it; But not being able to draw in any more, and notbeingslrong
enough with these who he had so Debauch'd, they did not make
their Attempt.
THIS, it seems, was not discover'd to the Captain till af-
ter the Ship was discharg'd in the Port of London, and the
Men paid off and dismiss'd; when Information being given,
the said Captain endeavour'd to have apprehended Gow and
his Accomplices; but having, (as 'twas supposed) gotten some
Notice of the Design, made off and shifted for themselves as
wellasthey could, in whichit was his Lot to go over to Holland.
HERE it was, viz., at Amsterdam, that Gow ship'd
himself afore the Mail, (as the seamen called it) that is to say,
as a Common Sailor, on Board an English Ship 0/200 Tons
Burden, called the George Galley. He ship'd himself at firsl,
Introduct1on 161
as I have said, afore the Masl; but afterwards, which added
to the great Misfortune, appearingto be an activeskilful Sailor,
he obtain'd the Favour of being made Second Mate; the Ship
was Commanded by one Oliver Ferneau, a Frenchman, but
a Subjecl of Great Britain, being of the Island of Guernsey,
to which also did the Ship belong, but was then in theserviceof
the Merchants of Amsterdam.
CAP T A/iVFerneau, being aManofReputationamong
the Merchants at Amsterdam, got a Voyagefor his Ship from
thence to Santa Cruz, on the coasl of Barbary, to Load Bees
Wax, and to carry it to Genoa, whichwashisdeliveringPort;
and as the Dutch, having war with the Turks of Algiers,
were willing to employ him as an English Ship, so he was as
willing to be Mann'd with English Seamen; and according-
ly, among the resl, he unhappily took on Board this Gow with
his wretched Gang, such as Macaulay, Melvin, Williams,
and others; but not being able to Man themselves wholly with
English or Scots, they were oblig'd to take some Swedes and
other Seamen to make up his Compliment, which was 23 in
all; among the latter Sort one wasnam'd'Winter,andanother
Peterson, both of them Swedes by Nation, but as wicked, too,
as Gow and his other Fellows were.
THEY Sail'dfrom the Texel in the month of August
1724, and arrived at Santa Cruz on the 2nd of September
following, where, having a Supercargo on Board who took
Charge of the Loading andfour Chesls of Money to Purchase
it, they soon got the Bees Wax on Board, and on the 3rd of No-
vember they appointed to set Sail to pursue the Voyage.
THUS much seems, however, proper to signify to the
World, before they enter into the resl of Gow'j Story, because
ytis evidentfrom hence, that the late barbarous and inhuman
Action was not the Effecl of a sudden Fury rais'd in the Minds
of the whole Company by the ill Usage they had receiv'd from
vol. 11 m
Captain Ferneau in the Matter of their Provisions, or from
their having overheard the said Ferneau threaten them when
he spoke to the Mate, upon the Quarter Deck to get small Arms
into the great Cabbin, which they might suppose was in order
to seize on them, and bring them to Correclion, and so, in their
Heat of Blood, might run them up to such a height of Rage as
to commit the Murthers which they did not intend before.
B U T'tis evident that this Gow in particular, whatever
the resl might have done, had entertain'd this bloody Resolu-
tion in General (J mean of turning Pirate) long before this
Voyage; he had endeavour 'd to put it in praclice, at leasl once
before, namely, in the Ship {mentioned above) Bound from
Lisbon for London, and had only fail'd for want of being
able to bring over a sufficient Gang of Rogues to his Party;
whether he had not had the same Design in his Head long be-
fore, that we do not know; but it seems he had not been able to
bring it to pass till now, when finding some little Discontent
among the Men, on account of their Provisions, he was made
the Devil's Inslrument to run up those Discontents to such a
dreadful height of Fury and Rage as we shallfind they did,
AND tbisjuslly entitles Gow to the Charge of being the
Principal, as well Author as Agent, in the Tragedy that fol-
low'd. Nor does it at all take off the Charge that Winter and
Peterson began the mutinous Language towards the Captain.
T H E Design musl certainly have been laid among them
before; how else should so many of them so easily form such a
wicked Scheme in the few Minutes they had to talk together?
Gow therefore is, I say, juslly charg'd as Author of all the
wicked Conclusions among them, and as havingform'd a Re-
solution, in his own Mind to turn Pirate the fir si Time he had
an Opportunity, whatever Ship or whatever Voyage he went
upon.
The ADVENTURES of
CAPTAIN JOHN GOW
THE following Account being chiefly confin'd to
the Conduct of this outrageous Pirate, Captain
Gow, after his having actually turn'd Pirate, in
this particular Ship, the George Galley, we must content
ourselves with beginning where he began, that is to say,
when they seiz'd the Captain, murdered him and his
Men, and ran away with the Ship, on the coast of Barbary,
in the Mediterranean Sea.
It was the 3rd of November, Anno i724, when, as has
been observ'd, the Ship having lain two Months in the
Road at Santa Cruz, taking in her Lading, the Captain
made Preparations to put to Sea; and the usual Signalsfor
Sailing having been given, some of the Merchants from
on Shore, who had been concern'd in furnishing the Car-
go, came on Board in the Forenoon to take their Leave of
the Captain, and wish him a good Voyage, as is usual on
such Occasions.
Whether it was concerted by the whole Gang before-
hand we know not; but while the Captain was treating
and entertaining the Merchants under the Awning upon
the Quarter-Deck, as is the Custom in those hot Coun-
tries, three of the Seamen, viz. Winter and Peterson, two
Swedes, and Macaulay a Scotchman, came rudely upon the
Quarter-Deck, and as if they took that Opportunity be-
cause the Merchants were present, believing the Captain
would not use any Violence with them, in the presence of
i64 The Adventures of
the Merchants, they made a long Complaint of their ill
Usage, and particularly of their Provisions and Allow-
ance (as they said) being not sufficient, nor such as was
ordinarily made in other Merchant Ships; seeming to
load the Captain, Monsieur Ferneau, with being the Oc-
casion of it, and that he did it for his private Gain; which
however had not been true if the Fact had been true, the
Overplus of Provisions (if the stores had been more than
sufficient) belonging to the Owners, not to the Captain,
at the end of the Voyage; there being also a Steward on
Board to take the Account.
In their making this Complaint, they seem'd to direct
their speech to the Merchants, as well as to the Captain,
as if they had been concern'd in the Ship (which they were
not) or, as if desiring them to intercede for them with the
Captain, that they might have Redress, and might have a
better Allowance.
The Captain was highly provok'd atthis Rudeness,as,
indeed, hehadreason; it being a double Affront to him, as
it was done in the view of the Merchants who were come
on Board to him, and to do him an Honour at Parting;
however, he restrain'd his Passion, and gave them not the
least angry Word, only, that if they were aggriev'd, they
had no more to do, but to have let him know it, that if they
were ill used, it was not by his Order, that he would en-
quire into it, and that if anything was amiss, it should be
rectify'd; with which the Seamen withdrew, seemingwell
satisfied with his Answer.
About five the same Evening they unmoor'd the Ship,
and hove short upon their best bower Anchor, expecting
the Land Breeze, as is usual on that Coast, to carry them
out to Sea; but, instead of that, it fell stark Calm, and the
Captain fearing the Ship should fall foul of her own An-
chor, ordered the Mizzen-top Sail to be furl'd.
Peterson, one of the malcontent Seamen, being the
nearest Man at hand, seem'd to go about it, but mov'd so
carelessly, and heavily, that it appear'd plainly he did not
care whether it was done or no; and particularly as if he
had a mind the Captain should see it, and take Notice of
it; and the Captain did so, for perceiving how awkwardly
he went about it, he spoke a little tartly to him, and asked
him what was the reason he did not stir a little and furl the
Sail.
Peterson, as if he waited for the Question, answered
in a surly Tone, and with a kind of Disdain, "So as we eat
so shall we work" This he spoke aloud, so as thathemight
be sure the Captain should hear him, and the rest of the
Men also; and 'twas evident, that as he spokeintheplural
Number We, so he spoke their Minds as well as his Own,
and Words which they had all agreed to before.
The Captain, however, tho' he heard plain enough
what he said, took not the least Notice of it, or gave him
the least room to believe he had heard him, beingnot will-
ing to begin a Quarrel with the Men, and knowing that if
he took any Notice at all of it, he must resent itand punish
it too.
Soon after this the Calm wentoff,andtheLand-Breeze
sprung up, as is usual on that Coast, and they immediately
weigh'd and stood off to Sea; but the Captain having had
those two Ruffles with his Men, just at their putting to
Sea, was very uneasy in his Mind, as, indeed, he had rea-
son to be; and the same Evening, soon after they were
under Sail, the Mate being walking on the QuarterDeck,
he went, and taking twoor three Turnswith him, toldhim
how he had been us'd by the Men, particularly how they
affronted him before the Merchants, and whatan Answer
Peterson had given him on the Quarter-Deck when he or-
dered him to furl the Mizen-top Sail.
The mate was surpriz'd at the Thing as well as the
Captain, and after some other Discourse about it,in which
'twas their Unhappiness not to be so private as they ought to
have been in a Case of such Importance, theCaptain toldhim
he thought it was absolutely necessary to have a Quantity
of small Arms brought immediately into the great Cab-
bin, not only to defend themselves if there should be oc-
casion, but also that he might be in a Posture to correct
those Fellows for their Insolence, especially if he should
meet with any more of it: The Mate agreed that it was
necessary to be done, and had they said no more, and said
this more privately all had been well, and the wicked De-
sign had been much more difficult, if not the execution of
it effectually prevented.
But two Mistakes in this Part was the ruin of them all:
(1) That the Captain spoke it without due Caution, so
that Winter'and Peterson, the two principal Malcontents,
and who were expressly mentioned by the Captain to be
corrected, overheard it, and knew by that Means what
they had to expect, if they did not immediately bestir
themselves to prevent it. (2) The other Mistake was that
when the Captain and Mate agreed that it was necessary
to have the Arms got ready and brought into the great
Cabbin, the Captain unhappily bade him go immediately
to Gow, the second Mate and Gunner, and give him Or-
ders to get the Arms cleared and loaded for him, and so to
bring them up to the great Cabbin, which was, in short,
to tell the Conspirators that the Captain was preparing to
be too strong for them if they did not fall to work with
him immediately.
Winter and P^/mo«wentimmediately Forward, where
they knew the reft of the Mutineers were, and to whom
they communicated what they had heard; telling them
that it was time to provide for their own Safety, for other-
wise their Destruction was resolv'd on, and the Captain,
would soon be in such a Posture that there would be no
meddling with him.
While they were thus consulting at first, as they said,
only for their own Safety, Gow and Williams came in to
them, with some others, to the Number of eight; and no
sooner were they joined by these two, but they fell down-
right to the Point, which Gow had so long form'd in his
own Mind, (viz.) to seize upon the Captain and Mate,
and all those that they could not bring to joyn with them;
in short, to throw them into the Sea, and to go upon the Ac-
count.
All those who are acquainted with the Sea Language
know the Meaning of that Expression, and that it is, in
few Words, to run away with the Ship and turn Pirates.
Villainous Designs are soonest concluded; as they
had but little Time to consult upon what Measures they
should take, so a very little Consultation serv'd for what
was before them, and they came to this short but hellish
Resolution, (viz.) Thatthey wouldimmediately, that very
Night, murther the Captain, and such others as they
nam'd, and afterwards proceed with the Ship as they
should see Cause.
And here it is to be observ'd, that tho' Winter and Pe-
terson were in the first Proposal, namely, to prevent their
being brought to Correction by the Captain, yet Gow and
168 ftADVENTURBSc/
Williams were the principal Advisers in the bloody Part,
which, however, the rest soon came into; for, as I said be-
fore, as they had but little Time to resolve it: so they had
but very little Debate about it; but what was first propos'd
was forthwith engag'd in and consented to.
Bes1des, it must not be omitted that, as I have said, up-
on good Grounds, that Gow had always had the wicked
Game of Pirating in his Head, and that he had attempted
it, or rather try'd to attempt it, before, but was not able to
bring it to pass: So he had, and Williams also had several
times, even in this very Voyage, dropt some hints of this
vile Design, as they thought there was Room for it; and
touch'd two or three Times at what a noble Opportunity
they had of Enriching themselves, and making their For-
tunes, as they wickedly call'd it: This was when they had
the four Chests of Money on Board; and Williams made
it a kind of a Jest in his Discourse how easily they might
carry it off, Ship and all: But as they did not find them-
selves Seconded, or that any of the Men shewed them-
selves in favour of such a thing, but rather spoke of it with
Abhorrence, they pass'd it over as a kind of Discourse
that had nothing at all in it; except that one of the Men,
(viz.) the Surgeon, took them up short once, for so much
as mentioning such a Thing, told them the Thought was
Criminal, and it ought not to be spoken of among them.
Which Reproof, 'twas suppos'd, cost him his Life after-
wards.
As Gow and his Comrade had thus started the Thing
at a Distance before, though it was then without Success,
yet they had the Less to do now, when other Discontents
had rais'd a secret Fire in the Breasts of the Men; for now
being, as it were, Mad and Desperate, with Apprehen-
sions of their beingto be severely Punish'dby the Captain,
they wanted no Perswasions to come into the most wicked
Undertaking that the Devil, or any of his Agents could
propose to them. Nor do we find, that upon any of their
Examinations they pretended to have made any Scruples
of, or Objections against the Cruelty of the bloody At-
tempt that was to be made, but came into it at once, and
resolved to put it in Execution immediately, that is to say,
the very same Evening.
It was the Captain's constant Custom to call all the
Ship's Company every Night, at Eight a'Clock, into the
Great Cabbin to prayers; and then the Watch being set,
one Watch went upon Deck, and the other turn'd in (as
the Seamen call it), that is, went to their Hammocks to
Sleep; And here they concerted their devilish Plot. It was
the Turn of five of the Conspirators to go to Sleep, and of
these, Goto and Williams, were two; the three, who were
to be upon the Deck, were Winter, Rolson, and Melvin a
Scotchman.
The Persons they had immediately design'd for De-
struction, were four, (viz.) the Captain, the Mate, the
Super Cargo, and the Surgeon, whereof all, but the Cap-
tain, were gone to Sleep; the Captain himself being upon
the Quarter-Deck.
Between Nine and Ten at Night, all being quiet and
secure, and the poor Gentlemen, that were to be mur-
ther'd fast asleep, the Villains that were below, gave the
Watch-Word, which was, "who Fires next?" at which
they all got out of their Hammocks with as little Noise as
they could, and going, in the Dark, to the Hammocks of
the Chief Mate, Super Cargo, and Surgeon, they cut all
their Throats; the Surgeon's Throat was cut so effectual-
ly, that he could struggle very little with them, but leaping
out of his Hammock, ran up to get upon the Deck, hold-
ing his Hand upon his Throat, but stumbled at the Tiller,
and falling down, had no Breath, and consequently no
Strength, to raise himself, but dy'd where he lay.
The Mate, whose Throat was cut, but not his Wind-
pipe, had struggled so Vigorously with the Villain, that
attempted him that he got from him, and got into the
Hold; and the Super Cargo, in the same Condition, got
forwards between Decks, under some Deals, and both of
them begg'd, with the most moving Cries and Intreaties,
for their Lives; and when nothing could prevail, they
beg'd with the same earnestness, but for a few Moments
to Pray to God, and Recommend their Souls to His Mer-
cy ; but alike in Vain, for the wretched Murtherers, heated
with Blood, were pass'd all Pitty; and not being able to
come at them with their Knives, with which they had be-
gun the Execution, they shot them with their Pistols,
Firing several times upon each of them, till they found
they were quite dead.
As all this, before the Firings, could not be done with-
out some Noise, the Captain, who was walking alone up-
on the Quarter-Deck, call'd out and ask'd, what was the
Matter? The Boatswain, who sat on the After Bits, and
was not of the Party, answer'd He could not tell; but was
afraid there was some Body Over-board; upon which the
Captain step'd toward the Ships Side to look over, when
Winter, Rowlinson, and Melvin, coming that moment be-
hind him, lay'd Hands on him, and lifting him up, at once
attempted to throw him Overboard into the Sea; but he
being a nimble, strong Man, got hold of the Shrouds, and
struggled so hard with them, that they could not break
his Hold; but turning his Head, to look behind him, to
see who he had to deal with, one of them cut his Throat
with a broad Dutch Knife, but neither was that Wound
Mortal: And the Captain still struggled with them, tho'
seeing he should undoubtedly be Murthered, he con-
stantly cry'd out to God for Mercy, for he found there
was no Mercy to be expected from them: During this
Struggle, another of the Murtherers stab'd him with a
Knife in the Back, and that with such Force, that the Vil-
lain could not draw the Knife out again to repeat his
Blow, which he would otherwise have done.
At this Moment Gow came up from the Butchery he
had been at between Decks, and seeing the Captain still
alive, he went close up to him and shot him (as he con-
fess'd) with a Brace of Bullets.
What Part he shot him into, could not be known; tho'
they said he shot him into the Head; however, he had yet
Life enough, tho' they threw him Over-board, to take
hold of a Rope, and would still have saved himself, but
they cut that Rope, and he fell into the Sea, and was seen
no more. Thus they finished the Tragedy, having mur-
thered four of the principal Men of Command in the
Ship, so that there was now no Body to Oppose them; for
Gow being Second Mate and Gunner, the Command fell
to him of Course, and the rest of the Men having no Arms
ready, nor knowing how to get at any, were in the utmost
Consternation, expecting they would go on with the
Work and cut all their Throats.
In this Fright every one shifted for himself; as for
those who were upon Deck, some got into the Round
Tops, others got into the Ship's Head, resolving to throw
themselves into the Sea rather than to be mangled with
i72 The A D VE NTU res of
Knives, and murthered in Cold Blood, as the Captain and
Mate, &c, had been; Those who were below, not know-
ing what to do, or whose Turn it should be next, lay still
in their Hammocks, expecting Death every Moment;
and not daring to stir, least the Villains should think they
did it in order to make Resistance, which however they
were no way capable of doing, having no Concert one
with another, nor knowing any Thing in Particular of
one another, as who was Alive or who was Dead; whereas
had the Captain, who was himself a bold and stout Man,
been in his Great Cabbin with three or four Men with
him, and his Fire-Arms, as he intended to have had,those
eight Fellows had never been Able to have done their
Work; but every Man was taken Unprovided, and in the
utmost Surprise, so that the Murtherers met with no Re-
sistance: And as for those that were left, they were less
Able to make Resistance than the other; so that, as I have
said, they were in the utmost Terror and Amazement,
expecting every Minute to be Murthered as the rest had
been.
But the Villains had done: The Persons who had any
Command, were Dispatch'd, so they Cool'd a little as to
Blood. The first Thing they did afterward, was to call up
all the Eight upon the Quarter-Deck, where they Con-
gratulatedone another, andshookHands together engag-
ing to proceed, by unanimous Consent, in their resolved
Design, that is to say, of turning Pirates; in Order to
which, they with a Nem. Con., chose Gow to Command
the Ship, promising all Subjection and Obedience to his
Orders (so that now we must call him Captain Gow) and
he, by the same Consent of the rest, named Williams to be
his Lieutenant. Other Officers they appointed afterwards.
The first Order they issued, was to let all the rest of the
Men know, that if they continued Quiet, and offer'd not
to Meddle with any of their Affairs, they should receive
no Hurt; but strictly forbid any Man among them to set
a Foot Abaft the Main-mast, except they were call'd to
the Helm, upon pain of being immediately cut in Pieces;
keeping, for thatPurpose, one Man at the Steerage-door,
and one upon the Quarter-deck, with drawn Cutlasses in
their Hands; but there was no need for it, for the Men
were so terrified with the bloody Doings they had seen,
that theynever offer'dto come in sighttill they were call'd.
Their next Work was to throw the three dead Bodies,
of the Mate, the Surgeon, and the Super Cargo over
Board, which, they said, lay in their Way, and that was
soon done, their Pockets first search'd and rifled. From
thence they went to work with the Great Cabbin and with
all the Lockers, Chests, Boxes, and Trunks; These they
Broke open and Rifled, that is, such of them as belong'd
to themurtheredPersons ;andwhatevertheyfound there,
they shar'd amongthemselves: When they had done this,
they call'd for Liquor, and sat down to Drinking till
Morning, leaving the Men (as above) to keep Guard, and
particularly to guard the Arms, but Relieved them from
Time to Time as they saw Occasion.
By this Time they had drawn in four more of the Men
to approve of what they had done, and promise to Joyn
with them, so that now they were twelve in Number, and
being but 24 at first:, whereof four were Murthered, they
had but eight Men to be Apprehensive of, and those they
could easily look after; so for the next Day they sent for
them all to appear before their new Captain, where they
were told by Gow, what his Resolution was, viz., to go a
Cruising, or to go upon the Account (as above) that if they
were willing to Joyn with them, and go into their Mea-
sures, they should be well used, and there should be no
Distinction among them, but they should all fare alike;
that they had been forced by the barbarous Usage of Fer-
neau to do what they had done, but that now there was no
looking back; and therefore as they had not been con-
cern'd in what was past, they had nothing to do but to act
in Concert, do their Duty as Sailors, and obey Orders for
the good of the Ship, and no Harm should he do to any of
them.
As they all looked like condemn'd Prisoners brought
up to the Bar to receive Sentence of Death, so they all an-
swer'd by a profound Silence; not one Word being said
by any of them, which Gow took, as they meant it, (viz.,)
for a Consent, because they durst not refuse; so they were
then permitted to go up and down every where as they
used to do. Tho' such of them as sometimes afterwards
showed any Reluctance to adt as Principals, were never
Trusted, always Suspected, and often severely Beaten,
and some of them were many ways inhumanly Treated,
and that particularly by Williams, the Lieutenant, who
was, in his Nature a merciless, cruel, and inexorable
Wretch, as we shall have occasion to take Notice of again
in its Place.
They were now in a new Circumstance of Life, and
acting upon a different Stage of Business, tho' upon the
same Stage as to the Element, the Water; before, they
were a Merchant Ship, loaden upon a good Account with
Merchants Goods from the Coast of Barbary, and bound
to the Coast of Italy: But they were now a Crew of Pirates,
or, as they call them in the Levant, Corsaires, Bound no
where, but to look out for Purchase and Spoil wherever
they could find it.
In pursuit of this wicked Trade, they first chang'd the
Name of the Ship, which was before called the George
Gaily, and which they call now the Revenge, a Name in-
deed suitable to the bloody Steps they had taken: In the
next place, they made the best of the Ships Forces: The
Ship had but twelve Guns mounted when they came out
of Holland; but as they had six more good Guns in the
Hold, with Carriages and every Thing proper for Service
(which they had in Store, because being Freighted for the
Dutch Merchants, and the Algerines being at War with
the Hutch, they suppos'd they might want them for De-
fence); Now they took care to Mount them for a much
worse Design; so that now they had 18 Guns, tho' too
many for the number of Hands they had on Board.
In the third Place, instead of pursuing their Voyage to
Genoa with the Ships Cargo, they took a clear contrary
Course, and resolv'd to Station themselves upon the
Coasts of Spain and Portugal, and to Cruise upon all Na-
tions; but what they chiefly aim'd at, was a Ship with
Wine, if possible, for that they wanted Extreamly.
The first Prize they took was an English Sloop belong-
ing to Pool, Thomas Wise, Commander, bound fromNew-
foundlandwitb. Fish forCadiz: This was aPrize of no Value
to them, for they knew not what to do with the Fish; so
they took out the Master, Mr. Wise, and his Men, who
were but Five in Number, with their Anchors, and Cables,
and Sails, and what else they found worth taking out, and
sunk the Vessel.
N.B.—Here, it is to be observ'd, theyfound a Man veryfit
for their Turn, one James Belvin, he was Boatswain of the
Sloop, a slout, brisk Fellow, and a very good Sailor, but other-
ways wicked enough to suit with their Occasion, and as soon
as he came among them he discover1 d it;fortho' he was not in
the firsl bloody Contrivance, nor in the terrible Execution of
which I have given a Relation, that is to say, he was not guilty
of running away with the Ship George Gaily, nor of mur-
thering the four Innocent Men, which we have given an
Account of above; yet 'tis Evident he joyn'd Heartily in
all the Villainies which follow'd. And, indeed, this Man's
Fate is a just and needful Caution to all those Sailors, who
being taken in other Ships by the Pirates, think that is a
sufficient Plea for them to act as real Pirates afterwards;
and that the Plea or Pretence of being Forced, will be a
sufficient Protection to them, however Guilty they may
have been afterward, and however Volunteer they may
have Acted when they came among the Pirates.
Doubtless 'tis possible for a Man to prove a hearty
Rogue after he is forced into the Service of the Pirates,
however Honest he was before, and however Undesign-
edly or against his Consent he at first came among them:
Therefore those who expect to be Acquitted in a Court of
Justice afterward on Pretence of their being at first Forced
into the Company of Rogues, must take care not to act
anything in Concert with them while they are Embark'd
together, but what they really cannot Avoid, and are ap-
parently under a Constraint in the doing.
But this Man, 'twas plain, acted a quite different Part;
for after he took on with them, he took all Occasions to
engage their Confidence, and to convince them that he
was Hearty in his Joyning them. In a Word, he was the
most active and vigorous Fellow of any that were, as it
may be said, forc'd into their Service; for many of the
others, tho' they acted with them, and were apparently
Assisting, yet there was always a kind of Backwardness
and Disgust at the Villainy, for which they were often
maltreated, and always suspected by their Masters.
The next Prize they took was a Scotch Vessel, bound
from Glassgow, with Herrings and Salmon, from thence
to Genoa, and commanded by one Mr John Somerville,
of Port Patrick. This Vessel was likewise of little Value to
them, except that they took out, as they had done from
the other, their Arms, Ammunition, Cloths, Provisions,
Sails, Anchors, Cables, &c, and every Thing of Value,
and therefore they sunk her too, as they had done the
Sloop. The Reason they gave for sinking these two Ves-
sels was to prevent their being Discover'd; for as they
were now Cruising on the Coast of Portugal, had they let
the Ships have gone with several of their Men on Board,
they would presently have stood in for the Shore, and have
given the Alarm; and the Men of War, of which there
were several, as well Dutch as English, in the River of Lis-
bon, would presently have put out to Sea in Quest of them;
And they were very unwilling to leave the Coast of Portu-
gal till they had got a Ship with Wine, which they very
much wanted.
They Cruised eight or ten Days after this without see-
ing so much as one Vessel upon the Seas, and were just
resolving to stand more to the Norward, to the Coast of
Gallitia, when they descry'd a Sail to theSouthward, being
a Ship about as big as their own, tho' they could not per-
ceive what Force she had; however, they gave Chase, and
the Vessel perceiving it, crouded from them with all the
Sail they could make, hoisting up French Colours, and
standing away to the Southward.
vol. 11 n
Th ey continued the Chase three Days and three Nights,
and though they did not gain much upon her, the French-
man Sailing very well, yet they kept her in sight all the
while, and for the most part within Gun-shot. But the
third Night, the Weather proving a little Haizy, the
Frenchman chang'd his Course in the Night, and so got
clear of them, and good Reason they had to bless them-
selves in the Escape they had made: If they had but known
what a dreadful Crew of Rogues they had fallen among,
if they had been taken.
They were now gotten a long Way to the Southward,
and being greatly Disappointed, and in want of Water as
well as Wine, they resolved to stand away for the Maderas,
which they knew was not far off, so they accordingly made
the Island in two Days more, and keeping a large Offing,
they Cruiz'd for three or four Days more, expecting to
meet with some Portuguese Vessel going in or coming out;
but 'twas in Vain, for nothing stirr'd: So, tir'd with Ex-
pecting, they stood in for the Road, and came to an An-
chor, tho' at a great Distance; then they sent their Boat
towards the Shore with seven Men, all well arm'd, to see
whether it might not be Practicable to Board one of the
Ships in the Road, andcuttingheraway from her Anchors,
bring her off; or if they found that could not be done, then
their Orders were to Intercept some of the Boats belong-
ing to the Place, which carry Wines off on Board the Ships
in the Road, or from one Place to another on the Coast;
but they came back again disappointed in both, every
Body being allarm'd and aware of them, knowing by their
Posture what they were.
Having thus spent several Days to no Purpose, and
finding themselves Discover'd (at length being apparent-
ly under a Necessity to make an Attempt some where),
they stood away for Porto Santa, about ten Leagues to the
windward of Maderas, and belonging also to the Portu-
guese; here putting up British Colours, they sent their
Boat ashore with Captain Somervills Bill of Health, and a
present to the Governour of three Barrels of Salmon and
six Barrels of Herrings, and a very civil Message, desir-
ing leave to Water, and to buy some Refreshments, pre-
tending to be Bound to .
The Governour very courteously granted their Desire,
but with more Courtesy than Discretion, went off him-
self, with about Nine or ten of his principal People, to pay
the English Captain a Visit, little thinking what a kind of
a Captain it was they were going to Compliment, and
what Price it might have Cost them.
However Gow, handsomely dress'd, receiv'd them
with some Ceremony,and entertain'd them tollerably
well for a while; but the Governour having been kept as
long by Civillity as they could, and the Refreshments
from the Shore not appearing, he was forced to Unmask;
and when the Governour and his Company rose up to
take their leave, they were, to their great Surprize, sud-
denly surrounded with a gang of Fellows with Musquets
and an Officer at the Head of them, who told them, in so
many Words, they were the Captains Prisoners, and must
not think of going on Shore any more till the Water and
Provisions which were promis'd should come on Board.
It is impossible to conceive the Consternation and Sur-
prize the Portuguese Gentry were in; nor is it very Decent-
ly to be express'd; the poor Governour was so much more
than half Dead with the Fright that he really Befoul'd
himself in a piteous Manner; and the rest were in no much
better Condition; they trembled, cry'd, begg'd, cross'd,
themselves, and said their Prayers as Men going to Exe-
cution ; but 'twas all one, they were told flatly the Captain
was not to be Trifled with, that the Ship was in want of
Provisions, and they would have them, or they would car-
ry them all away: They were however well enough Treat-
ed, except the Restraint of their Persons, and were often
ask'd to Refresh themselves, but they would neither Eat
or Drink any more all the while they stay'd on Board,
which was till the next Day in the Evening, when to their
great Satisfaction they saw a great Boat come off"from the
Fort, and which came directly on Board with seven Buts
of Water, a Cow and a Calf, and a good number of Fowls.
When the Boat came on Board, and had delivered the
Stores, Captain Gow Complimented the Governour and
his Gentlemen, and discharg'd them to their great Joy;
and besides discharging them, he gave them, in return
for the Provisions they brought, two Cerons of Bees Wax,
and fir'd them three guns at their going away. I suppose,
however, they will have a care how they go on Board of
any Ship again in Compliment to their Captain, unless
they are very sure who they are.
Having had no better Success in this out of the way
run to the Maderas, they resolved to make the best of their
way back again to the Coast of Spain or Portugal. They
accordingly left Porto Santa the next Morning, with a
fair Wind, standing directly for Cape St Vincent or the
Southward. Cape.
They had not been upon the Coast of Spain above two
or three Days before they met with a New England Ship,
Cross Commander, laden with Staves, and bound
for Lisbon, and being to Load there with Wine for Lon-
don; this was a Prize also of no Value to them, and they
began to be very much discouraged with their bad For-
tune. However, they took out Captain Cross and his men,
which were seven or eight in Number, with most of the
Provisions and some of the Sails, and gave the Ship to
Captain Wise, the Pool man who they took at first in a
Sloop from Newfoundland; and in order to pay Wise and
his Men for what he took from them, and make them Sa-
tisfaction, as he call'd it, he gave to Captain Wise, and his
Mate 24 Cerons of Bees Wax, and to each of his Men,
who were four in Number, two Cerons of Wax each;
thus he pretended honestly, and to make Reparation of
Damages by giving them the Goods which he had robb'd
the Dutch Merchants of, whose Super-Cargo he had
Murthered.
After this, Cruising some Days off of the Bay, they
met with a French Ship from Cadiz, laden with Wine,
Oyl, and Fruit; this was, in some respect, the very Thing
they wanted; so they Mann'd her with their own Men
and stood off to Sea, that they might divide the Spoil of
her with more Safety, for they were too near the Land.
And first they took out the French Master and all his
Men, which were twelve in Number; then they shifted
great Part of the Cargo, especially of the Wine, with some
Oyl and a large quantity of Almonds, out of the French
Ship into their own; with five of his best Guns, and their
Carriages, all their Ammunition and small Arms, and all
the best of their Sails, and then he gave that Ship to Cap-
tain Somerville, the Glasgow Captain, whose Ship they had
sunk, and to Captain Cross, the New England Captain,
who they had taken but just before; and to do Justice, as
they call'd it, here also, they gave half the Ship and Cargo
to Somerville, onequarterto his Mate, and the other quar-
ter to Captain Cross, and 16 Cerons of Wax to the Men to
be shar'd among them.
It is to be observ'd here that Captain Somerville carried
all his Men along with him, except one who chose to en-
ter among the Pirates, so that he cou'd never pretend he
was forced into their Service; but Cross's men were all
detain'd, whether by Force or by their own Consent, does
not appear at present.
The Day before this Division of the Spoil they saw a
large Ship to Windward, which at first put them into
some Surprize, for she came bearing down directly upon
them, and they thought she had been a Portuguese Man
of War; but they found soon after that it was a Merchant
Ship, had French Colours, and bound Home, as they sup-
pos'd, from the Wesl Indies ; andit was so, for, as we after-
wards learn'd, she was loaded at Martinico, and bound for
Rochelle.
The Frenchman, not fearing them, came on large to the
Wind, being a Ship of much greater Force than Gow's
ship, and carrying 32 Guns and 80 Men, besides a great
many Passengers; however Gow at first made as if he
would lye by for them; but seeing plainly what a Ship it
was, and that they should have their Hands full of her, he
began to consider, and calling his Men all together upon
the Deck, told them his Mind (viz.) That the Frenchman
was apparently superior in Force every way, that they
were but ill-mann'd, and had a great many Prisoners on
Board, and that some of their own People were not very
well to be trusted; that six of their best Hands were on
Board the Prize, and that all they had left were not suffici-
ent to ply their Guns and stand by the Sails; and that
therefore, as they were under no Necessity to engage, so
he thought it would be next to Madness to think of it, the
French Ship beingso very much Superior to themin Force.
The Generallity of the Men were of Gow's Mind, and
agreed to decline the Fight; but Williams, his Lieut.,
strenuously oppos'd it, and being not to be appeas'd by
all that Gow could say to him, or any one else, flew out in
a Rage at Gow, upbraiding him with being a Coward, and
not fit to command a Ship of Force.
The Truth is, Gow's Reasoning was Good, and the
Thing was Just, considering their own Condition. But
Williams was a Fellow uncapable of any solid Thinking,
had a kind of a savage, brutal Courage, but nothing of
true Bravery in him; and this made him the most despe-
rate and outrageous Villain in the World, and the most
cruel and inhuman to those whose Disaster it was to fall
into his Hands, as had frequently appear'd in his Usage
of the Prisoners, under his Power in this very Voyage.
Gow was a Man of Temper, and notwithstanding all
ill Language Williams gave him, said little or nothing,
but by way of Argument, against attacking the French
Ship, which would certainly have been too strong for
them: But this provok'd Williams the more, and he grew
to such an extravagant height, that he demanded boldly
of Gow to give his Orders for Fighting, which Gow de -
clining still, Williams presented his Pistol at him, and
snapt it, but it did not go off", which enrag'd him the more.
W1nter and Peterson, standing nearest to Williams,
and seeing him so furious, flew at him immediately, and
each of them fir'd a Pistol at him; one shot him thro' the
Arm, and the other into his Belly, at which he fell, and the
Men about him laid hold of him tothrowhim Over-board,
believing he was dead; but as they lifted him up, he start-
ed violently out of their Hands, and leaped directly into
the Hold, and from thence ran desperately into the Pow-
der-Room, with his Pistol cock'd in his Hand, swearing
he would blow them all up; and had certainly done it, if
they had not seiz'd him just as he had gotten the Scuttle
open, and was that Moment going in to put his hellish
Resolution into practice.
Hav1ng thus secur'd the demented, raving Creature,
they carryed him forward to the Place which they had
made on Purpose, between Decks, to secure their Pri-
soners, and put him in amongst them, having first loaded
him with Irons, and particularly Hand-cuffed him with
his Hands behind him, to the great Satisfaction of the
other Prisoners, who, knowing what a butcherly, furious
Fellow he was, were terrified, to the last Degree, to see
him come in among them, till they saw the Condition he
came in. He was, indeed, the Terror of all the Prisoners,
for he usually treated them in a barbarous manner, with-
out the least Provocation, and meerly for his Humour,
presenting Pistols to their Breasts, swearing he would
shoot them that Moment, and then would beat them un-
mercifully, and all for his Diversion, as he call'd it.
Hav1ng thus laid him fast, they presently resolv'd to
stand away to the Weslward, by which they quitted the
Martinico Ship, who by that time was come nearer to them,
and farther convinc'd them they were in no Condition to
have Engag'd her, for she was a stout Ship, and full of
Men.
All this happen'd just the Day before they shar'd their
last Prize among the Prisoners (as I have said), in which
theyputonsucha Mock-face of doing Justice to the sever-
al Captains and Mates, and other Men, their Prisoners,
whose Ships they had taken away, and who now they
made a Reparation to by giving them what they had taken
Violently from another, that it was a strange Medly of
Mock-Justice made up of Rapine and Generosity blend-
ed together.
Two Days after this they took a Brislol Ship, bound
from Newfoundland to Oporto with Fish; they let her Car-
go alone, for they had no occasion for Fish, but they took
out also almost all their Provisions, all the Ammunition,
Arms, &c, all her good Sails, also her best Cables, and
forced two of her Men to go away with them, and then
put 1 o of the French Men on Board her, and let her go.
But just as they were parting with her, they consulted
together what to do with Williams their Lieutenant, who
was then among their Prisoners, and in Irons; and after a
short Debate they resolv'd to put him on Board the Brislol
Man and send himaway too, whichaccordingly was done;
with Directions to the Master to deliver him on Board the
first English Man of War they should meet with, in order
to his being hang'd for a Pirate (so they Jeeringly call'd
him) as soon as he came to England, giving them also an
account of some of his Villainies.
The truth is, this Williams was a Monster, rather than
a Man; he was the most inhuman, bloody, and desperate
Creature that the World could produce; he was even too
wicked for Gow and all his Crew, tho' they were Pirates
and Murtherers, as has been said; his temper was so Sav-
age, so Villainous, so Merciless, that even the Pirates
themselves told him it was Time he was hang'd out of the
Way.
One Instance of this Barbarity in Williams can not be
omitted, and will be sufficient to justify all that can be said
of him, namely, thatwhen Gowgave it as a Reason against
engaging with the Martinico Ship, that he had a great
many Prisoners on Board, (as above) and some of their
own Men they couldnot depend upon; Williamspropos'd
to have them all call'd up, one by one, and to cut their
Throats and throw them Overboard; A proposal so Hor-
rid, that the worst of the Crew shook their Heads at it; yet
Gow answer'd him very handsomly, That there had been
too much Blood spilt already; yet the refusing this highten'd
the Quarrel, and was the chief Occasion of his offering to
Pistol Gow himself, as has been said at large: After which
his Behaviour was such, as made all the Ships Crew re-
solved to be rid of him. And 'twas thought, if they had not
had an Opportunity to send him away, as they did by the
Bristol Ship, they would have been oblig'd to have hang'd
him themselves.
This cruel and butcherly Temper of Williams being
carry'd to such a height, so near to the ruine of them all,
shock'd some of them, and, as they acknowledg'd, gave
them some check in the heat of their wicked Progress,
and had they had a fair Opportunity to have gone on shore
at the Time, without falling into the Hands of Justice,
'tis believed the greatest Part of them would have aban-
don'd the Ship, and perhaps the very trade of a Pirate too.
But they had dipt their Hands in Blood, and Heaven had
no doubt determin'd to bring them, that is to say, the Chief
of them, to the Gallows for it, as indeed they all deserv'd;
so they went on.
When they put Williams on board the Brislol Man,
and he was told what Directions they gave with him, he
began to relent, and made all the Intercession he could to
Captain Gow for Pardon, or at least not to be put on board
the Ship, knowing if he was carried to Lisbon, he should
meet with his Due from the Portuguese if not from the
English; for it seems he had been concern'd in some Vil-
lainies among the Portuguese, before he came on board
the George Galley, what they were he did not confess, nor
indeed did his own Ship's Crew trouble themselves to
examine him aboutit:Hehadbeenwickedenough among
them, and it was sufficient to make them use him as they
did; it was more to be wonder'd, indeed, they did not cut
him in pieces upon the Spot, and throw him into the Sea,
half on one side of the Ship, and half ontheother; for there
was scarce a Man in the Ship, but on one Occasion or
other, had some apprehensions of him, and might be said
to go in danger of his Life from him.
But they chose to shift their Hands of him this blood-
less way; so they double-fetter'd him and brought him
up: When they brought him out among the Men, he
begg'd they would throw him into the Sea and drown
him; then entreated for his Life with a meanness which
made them dispisehim, and with Tears, so that one Time
they began to relent; butthen the devilish Temper of the
fellow overruled it again; so at last they resolv'd to let him
go, and did accordingly put him on Board, and gave him
a hearty Curse at parting, wishing him a good Voyage to
the Gallows, as was made good afterwards, tho' in such
Company as they little thought of at that Time.
The Brislol Captain was very just to them, for, accord-
ing to their Orders, as soon as they came to Lisbon, they
put him on Board the Argyle, one of his Majesty's Ships,
Captain Bowler, Commander, then lying in the Tagus,
and bound Home for England, who accordingly brought
him Home; tho', as it happen'd, Heaven brought the
Captain and the rest of the Crew so quickly to the End of
their Villainies, that they all came Home time enough to
be hang'd with their Lieutenant. But I return to Gow and
his Crew. Having thus dismiss'd the Brislol Man, and
clear'd his Hands of most of his Prisoners, he, with the
same wicked Generosity, gave the BrislolCaptain 13 Cer-
ons of Bees Wax, as a Gratuity forhisTroubleand Charge
with the Prisoners,and in Recompence, as he call'd it, for
the Goods he had taken from him, and so they parted.
What these several Captains did, to whom they thus
divided the Spoil of poor Ferneau's Cargo, or, as I ought
rather to call it, of the Merchants' Cargo which was load-
ed in Africa; I say, what was done with the Bees-wax and
other Things which they distributed to the Captains, and
their Crews, who they thus transpos'd from Ship to Ship,
that we cannot tell, nor indeed could these People either
well know how to keep it or how to part with it.
It was certainly a Gift they had no power to give, nor
had the other any Right to it by their Donation; but as the
Owners were unknown, and the several Persons possess-
ing it are not easily known, I do not see which way the
poor Dutchmen can come at their Goods again.
It istrue,indeed, the Ships which they exchang'd may,
and ought to be restored, and the honest Owners put in
possession of them again, and I suppose will be so in a le-
gal Manner; but the Goods were so dispers'd that it was
impossible.
Tmswas the last Prize they took, not only on the Coast
of Portugal, but any where else; for Gow who, to give him
his due, was a Fellow of Council, and had a great Presence
of Mind in Cases of Exigence, consider'd that as soon as
the Brislol Ship came into the River of Lisbon, they would
certainly give an Accountof them,as well of their Strength,
as of their Station in which they Cruized; and that conse-
quently the English Men of War, of which there are gene-
rally some in that River, would immediately come Abroad
to look for them: So he began to Reason with his Officers,
that now the Coast of Portugal would be no proper Place
at all for them, unless they resolved to fall into the Hand
of the said Men of War, and that they ought to consider
immediately what to do.
In these Debates, some advised one Thing, some an-
other, as is usual in like Cases: some were for going on to
the Coast of Guinea, where (as they said) was Purchase
enough, and very rich Ships to be taken; others were for
goingtothe Wesl Indies, and to Cruize amongthe Islands,
and take up their Station at Tobago ; others, and that not
those of the most Ignorant, proposed the standing in to
the Bay of Mexico, and to joyn in with some of a new sort of
Pirates at St Jago de la Cuba, who are all Spaniards, and
call themselves guar da del Co asl a, that is, Guardships for
the Coast; but under that pretence make Prize of Ships
of all Nations, and sometimes even of their own country-
men too, but especially of the English; but when this was
propos'd, it was answered they durst not trust the Spani-
ards.
Another sort was for going to the North of America,
and after having taken a Sloop or two on the Coast of
New-England or New-York, laden with Provisions for the
Wesl-Indies, which would not have been very hard to do,
such being often passing and re-passing there, and by
which they might have been sufficiently stor'd with Pro-
vision, then to have gone away to the South Seas; but Gow
objected, that they were not Mann'd sufficiently for such
an Undertaking ;andlikewise, that they had notsufficient
Stores of Ammunition, especially of Powder, and of
small Arms, for any considerable Action with the Spani-
ards.
Then it was offered by the Boatswain, who it seems,
had been in that Part of the World, to go away to theHon-
duras,znd to the Bay of Campeachy, amongthe Buccaneers
and Logwood Cutters, and there they should in the first
Place, be sure to pick up forty or fifty stout Fellows, good
Sailors, and bold, enterprising Men, who understand the
Spaniards and the Spanish Coast on both sides of America
as well as any Men in the World, and had all Fire Arms
with them, and Ammunition too; and that being well
Mann'd, they might take their hazard for Provisions,
which might be had any where, at least of one Sort if not
of another; besides, when they were thoroughly Mann'd,
they might cruize for Provisions any where, and might be
as likely to meet with the New-York and New-England
Sloops on the back of the Islands, in their way to Barba-
does and Jamaica, as any where.
Others said they should go first to the Islands of New-
Providence, or to the mouth of the Gulph of Florida, and
then cruising on the Coast of North America, and making
their Retreat at New Providence, Cruize from the Gulf of
Florida, North upon the Coast of Carolina, and as high as
the Capes of Virginia. But nothing could be resolv'd on;
till at last Gow let them into the Secret of a Project which,
as he told them, he had long had in his Thoughts, and
which was, to go away to the North of Scotland, near the
Coast of which, as he said, he was Born and Bred, and
where he said, if they met with no Purchase upon the Sea,
he could tell them how they should Enrich themselves by
going on Shore.
To bring them to concur with this Design, he repre-
sented the Danger they were in, where they were (as
above:) The want they were in of fresh Water, and of se-
veral kinds of Provisions, but, above all, the Necessity
they were in of careening and cleaning their Ship: That it
was too long a Run for them to go to the Southward; and
that they had not Provisions to serve them till they could
reach to any Place proper for that Purpose; and might be
driven to the utmost Distress if they should be put by
from Watering, either by Weather or Enemies.
Also he told them, if any of the Men of War came out
in Search of them, they would never Imagine they were
gone away to the Northward; so that their Run that Way
was perfectly secure: And he could assure them of his
own Knowledge, that if they landed in such Places as he
should direct, they could not fail of a comfortable Booty
in plundering some Gentlemens Houses, who liv'd Se-
cure and Unguarded very near the Shore: And that tho'
the Country should be Allarm'd, yet before the Govern-
ment could send any Men of War to Attack them, they
might clean their Ship, lay in a Store of fresh Provisions,
and be gone; and besides that they would get a good many
stout Fellows to go along with them, upon his Encourage-
ment; and that they should be better Mann'd than they
were yet, and should be Ready against all Events.
These Arguments, and their approaching Fate Con-
curring, had a sufficient Influenceon the Ship's Company
to prevail on them to Consent: So they made the best of
their Way to the Northward, and about the middle of last
January theyarrived at Carriftown, in the Isles of Orkney,
and came to an Anchor in a Place which Gow told them,
was safe Riding under the Lee of a small Island at some
Distance from the Port.
Gow being sole Director, as well as Commander of the
Ship, call'd them all together, to tell them what Account
they should give of themselves, when they came to Con-
verse with any of the People of the Island, thattheymight
agree in their Story, and give no Cause of Suspicion; and
'tis most certain, that had they been careful to observe his
Directions, and not betray'd and expos'd themselves,
they mighthavepass'dundiscover'd,anddoneall the Mis-
chief they intended without allarming the Country. His
Orders were, that they should say they came from Cadiz,
and were bound for Stockholm, and thence to Dantzick;
but that they had had a long Passage, by reason of con-
trary Winds, and lost their Opportunity of passing the
Sound, which was now full of Ice, if not frozen up; and
that they had been driven so far to the Norward by Stress
of Weather, that they wanted Water andfresh Provisions,
and to clean their Ship; that they would pay for whatever
they were supply'd with; and that by the Time they had
clean'd their Ship, they hop'd the Weather would be
Warm, and the Seas open for them to proceed on their
Voyage. This Tale was easie to tell, and probable enough,
and therefore likely enough to be believed; and they all
oblig'd themselves to give the same Account exactly, and
not to vary the least Tittle of it, or so much as whisper
otherwise, upon Pain of immediate Death.
I n Carristoun Harbour they found a small Scotch Bark
—Lumsdale, Master—-laden with Wineand Brandy, and
bound about to the Isle of Man; this wasawelcomeThing
to them all; and had it been any where else, they would
have made it a good Prize: But as they had Goods suffici-
ent on board, and such as were very Acceptable Merchan-
dise, Lumsdale traded freely with them, and Goto bartered
seven Cerons of Wax and about 2001. Weight of Barbary
Copper with him for a Hogshead of Geneva and an An-
chor of Brandy, and some other Goods; and itwas believed
that Gow had some Money into the Bargain.
A day or two after, a Swedish Vessel came into the
Road, bound from Stockholm to Glasgow, and laden with
Swedes Iron, and Easl Country Plank; they traded with
her also for 20 Coil of new Rope, for which Gow gave the
Master eleven Cerons of Bees Wax: It has been said, they
plunder'd this Vessel of several other Goods, and oblig'd
the Master to promise to Sail directly to his Port, without
speaking to any Body, on Pain of sinking the Ship; But
this wants Confirmation; nor is it Probable, they would
venture to do so in a Port where they resolv'd to stay any
long Time, and where they knew it was so Necessary to
be entirely conceal'd.
But now their Misfortunes began to come on, and
Things look'd but with an indifferent Aspect upon them;
for several of their Men, especially such of them as had
been forc'd or decoy'd into their Service, began to think
of making their Escape from them; and to cast about for
Means to bring it to pass. The first was a young Man,
who was originally one of the Ships Company, but was
Forced by fear of being Murther'd, as has been observ'd,
to give a silent Assent togo with them; he took an Oppor-
tunity to get away.
It was one Evening when the Boat went on Shore (for
they kept a civil Correspondence with the People of the
Town), this young Fellow being one of the Ships Crew,
vol. 11 o
andhaving been several Times on Shore before, and there-
fore not suspected, gave them the Slip, and got away to a
Farm-house which lay under a Hill, out of sight; and
there, for two or three Pieces of Eight, he got a Horse,
and soon, by that means escap'd to Kirkwall, a Market-
Town, and the Chief of the Orkneys, about 12 miles from
the Place where the Ship lay.
As soon as he came there, he surrender'dhimself to the
Government, desiring Protection, and inform'd them
who Gow was, and what the Ships Crew were, and upon
what Business they were Abroad; with what else he knew
of theirDesigns, as to plundering the Gentlemens Houses,
&c. Upon which they immediately rais'd the Country,
and got a strength together to defend themselves.
But the next Disaster that attended them, was, (for
Misfortunes seldom come alone) more fatal than this, for
1o of Gow's Men, most of them likewise Men forced into
the Service, went away with the long Boat, making the
best of their Way for the main Land of Scotland.
N.B. These Men however they did, and what Shift so-
ever they made to get so far, were taken in the Firtb of
Edenburg, and made Prisoners there.
Had Gow taken the Alarm, as he ought to have done,
at either of these Accidents, and put to Sea, either stood
over for the Coast of Norway, or have run thro' Weslward,
between the Islands, and gone for the Isle of Man, or for
the North of Ireland, he might easily have gone clear off;
for there was no Vessel in the Country that was of Force
sufficient to have spoken with him.
But harden'd for his own Destruction, and Justice
evidently pursuing him, he grew Bolder for the Disaster;
and notwithstanding that the Country was alarm'd, and
that he was fully discover'd, instead of making a timely
Escape, he resolved to Land upon them, and to put his
intended Projects, (viz.) of Plundering the Gentlemens
Houses, in Execution, whatever it cost him.
In Order to this, he sent the Boatswain and i0 Men
on Shore, the very same Night, very well Arm'd, direct-
ing them to go to the House of Mr Honnyman of Graham-
sey, Sheriff of the County, and who was himself at that
Time, to his great good Fortune, from Home: The Peo-
ple of the House had not the least Notice of their coming,
so that when they knock'd at the Door it was immediately
open'd, upon which they all enter'd the House at once,
except one Panton, who they set Centinel, and order'd
him to stand at the Door to secure their Retreat, and to
secure any from coming in after them.
Mrs Honnyman and her Daughter were extremely
Frighted at the sight of so many Armed Men coming in-
to the House, and ran screaming about, like People Dis-
tracted, while the Pirates, not regarding them, werelook-
ing about for Chests and Trunks, where they might ex-
pect to find some Plunder: And Mrs. Honnyman, in her
Fright, coming to the Door, ask'd Panton, the Man who
was set Centinel there, what theMeaningof it all was? and
he told her freely they were Pirates, and that they came to
Plunder the House. At this she recovered some Courage,
and run back into the House immediately; and knowing,
to be sure, where her Money lay, which was very Con-
siderable, and all in Gold, she put the Bags in her Lap,
and boldly rushing by Panton, who thought she was only
running from them, in a Fright, carryed it all off, and so
made her escape with the Treasure. The Boatswain being
inform'd that the Money was carryed off, resolved to re-
venge himselfby burningthe Writings andPapers, which
they call there, the Charters of their Estates, and are al-
ways of great Value in Gentlemens Houses of Estates; but
theyoung Lady, Mr Honnyman's Daughter, hearingth em
threaten to burn the Writings, watch'd her Opportunity,
and running to the Charter Room where they lay, and ty-
ing the most considerable of them up in a Napkin, threw
them out of the Window, jumpt after them herself, and
Escaped without Damage, though the Window was one
Story high at least.
However the Pirates had the Plundering of all the
rest of the House, and carryed off a great deal of Plate
and Things of Value; and forced one of the Servants,
who played very well on the Bagpipe, to march along,
Piping before them, when they carryed them off to the
Ship.
The next Day they weigh'd Anchor, intending, tho'
they had clean'd but one side of the Ship, to put out to Sea
and quit the Coast; but sailing Easlward, they came to an
Anchor again at a little Island, call'd Calf sound; and, hav-
ing some farther Mischief in their view here, the Boat-
swain went on Shore again, with some Armed Men; but
meeting with no other Plunder, they carryed off three
Women, who they kept on Board some time, and used so
Inhumanely that when they set them on Shore again, they
were not able to go or to stand: and we hear that one of
them dyed on the Beach where they left them.
The next Day they weigh'd again, holding the same
Course Easlward thro' theOpeningsbetweenthe Islands,
till they came off of Rossness: And now Gow resolved to
make the best of his Way for the Islandof £^,toPlunder
the House of Mr. Fea, a Gentleman of a considerable
Estate, and who Gow had some Acquaintance with, hav-
ing been at School together when they were youths.
It seems Gow's Reason for resolving to attack this
Gentleman, who was his old Acquaintance, was, that he
thoughtthe Alarm, given at Carrisloun, would necessarily
draw the Gentlemen, and the best of their Forces, that
Way, which Guess was far from being Improbable; for
just so it was, only with Respect to Mr. Fea, who having
had the Allarm with the rest, yet stay'd at Home on a par-
ticular Occasion, his Wife being, at that Time very much
Indisposed.
It is to be observ'd here, that CarriSloun and Eda lie
with Respect to each other, N.-Easl and S.-Wesl, and the
Bodies of the chief Islands lye between them.
On the 13th of February, in the Morning, Gowappear-
ing with his Ship off the Island, call'd the Calf sound, Mr.
Fea and his Family were very much alarm'd, not being
able to gather above six or seven Men for his Defence ., he
therefore wrote a Letter to Gow, intending to send it on
Board as soon as he should get into the Harbour, to desire
him to forbear the usual Salutes with his great Guns, be-
cause Mrs Fea his Wife was so very much Indispos'd:
And this, as he would oblige his old Schoolfellow, telling
him at the same time, that the Inhabitants were all fled to
the Mountains, on the Report of his being a Pirate,which
he hoped would not prove true; in which Case, he should
be very ready to supply him with all such Necessaries as
the Island would afford; desiring him to send the Mes-
senger safe back, at whose Return the Allarms of thePeo-
ple would immediately be at an End.
The Tide it seems runs extreamly Rapid among those
Islands, and the Navigation is thereby render'd very dan-
gerous and uncertain: Gow was an able Seaman, but he
was no Pilot for that Place, and which was worse, he had
no Boat to Assist, in case of Extremity, to ware the Ship;
and in turning into CalfSoundhe stoodalittletoonearthe
Point of a little Island call'd the Calf, and which lay in the
middle of the Passage; here his Ship, missing Stays, was
in great Danger of going a-Shore, to avoid which he
dropp'd an Anchor under his Foot, which, taking good
hold,broughthimup,andhethoughttheDangerwasover.
But as the Wind was, he lay so near the Shore, that he
could not get under Sail again for want of a Boat to Tow
him out of the Channel, or to carry off an Anchor to heave
him out.
That little Island above is uninhabited, but affords
Pasture to five or six Hundred Sheep, which Mr Fea al-
ways keeps upon it, for it belonged wholly to him: Gow
was now in Distress, and had no Remedy but to send his
small Boat on Shore to Mr Fea, to desire his Assistance,
that is to say, to desire him to lend him a Boat to carry out
an Anchor to heave off the Ship.
Mr Fea sent back the Boat, and one James Laing'm it,
with the Letter which I have already mentioned; Gow
sent him back immediately with this Answer, by Word of
Mouth, (viz.) that he would write to no Body; But if Mr
Fea would order his People to assist him with a Boat, to
carry out an Anchor, he would Reward them handsomly:
Mr Fea, in the mean time, order'd his great Boat (for he
had such a Boat as Gow wanted) to be stav'd and launch'd
into the Water and sunk, and the Masts, Sails, and Oars
to be carryed privately out of Sight.
While this was doing, Mr Fea perceiv'd Gow's Boat
coming on Shore, with five Persons in her: These Men
having landed on the main Island, left their Boat on the
Beach, and all together march'd directly up to the Mansion
House. This put him into some Surprise at first, how-
ever, he resolv'd to meet them in a peaceable Manner,
though he perceiv'd they were all double Arm'd: when
he came up to them he entreated them not to go up to the
House, becauseof thelanguishing Condition of his Wife;
that she was already frighted with the Rumours which
had been rais'd of their being Pirates, and that she would
certainly die with the fear she was in for herself and Fa-
mily, if they came to the Door.
The Boatswain answer'd, They did not desire to fright
his Wife, or any Body else; but they came to desire the
assistance of his Boat, and if he would not grant them so
small a Favour, he had nothing to expect from them but
the utmost Extremity. Mr Fea return'd that they knew
well enough he could not answer giving them, or lending
them his Boat, or any Help, as they appear'd to be such
People as was reported; but that if they would take them
by Force, he could not help himself.
But in the mean time, talking still in afriendly Manner
to them, he ask'd them to go to a neighbouring House,
which he said was a Change House, that is a Publick-
House, and take a Cup of Ale with him.
This they consented to, seeing Mr Fea was all alone, so
they went all with him; Mr Fea in the mean time found
means to give private Orders that the Oars, and Mast and
Sails of the Pirates boat should be all carry'd away, and
that in a quarter of an Hour after they had sat together, he
should be call'd hastily out of the Room on some pretence
or other of some body to speak with him, all which was
perform'd to a Tittle.
When he had got from them, he gave Orders that his
Six Men, who, as before, he had got together, and who
were now come to him well arm'd, should place them-
selves at a certain Stile, behind a thick Hedge, and which
was about half the way between the Ale-House and his
own House; that if he came that way with the Boatswain
alone, they should suddenly start out upon them both,
and throwing him down, should seize upon the other; but
that if all the five came with him, he would take an Occa-
sion to be either before or behind them, so that they might
all fire upon them without danger of hurting him.
Havi ng given these Orders, and depending upon their
being well executed, he return'd to the Company, and
having given them more Ale, told them he would gladly
do them any Service that he could lawfully do, and that if
they would take the trouble of walking up to his House
in a peaceable Manner, that his Family might not be
frighted with seeing himself among them, they should
have all the Assistance that was in his Power.
The Fellows, whether they had taken too much Ale, or
whether the Condition of their Ship, and the Hopes of
getting a Boat to help them, blinded their Eyes, is not cer^
tain, fell with ease into his Snare, and agreed readily to go
along with Mr Fea ; but after awhile resolv'd not to go all
of them, only deputed the Boatswain to go, which was
what Mr Fea most desir'd. The Boatswain was very will-
ing to accept of the Trust, but it was observ'd he took a
great deal of care of his Arms, which was no less than four
Pistols, all loaded with a brace of Bullets each; nor would
he be persuaded to leave any of them behind him, no, not
with his own Men.
I n thisPostur e Mr Fea and the Boatswain walk'd alon g
J
together very quietly till they came to the Stile, which
having got over, Mr Fea, seeing his Men all ready, turn'd
short about upon the Boatswain, and taking him by the
Collar, told him he was his Prisoner, and the same Mo-
ment the rest of his men rushing upon them, threw them
both down, and so secur'd the Boatswain without giving
him time so much as to fire one Pistol. He cry'd out, in-
deed, with all his Might to allarm his men, but they soon
stopt his Mouth, by first forcing a Pistol into it, and then
a Handkerchief, and having disarm'd him, and bound
his Hands behind him, and his Feet together, Mr Fea left
him there under a Guard, and with his five other Men,
but without any Arms, at least that could be seen, return'd
to the Ale-House to the rest: The House having two
Doors, they divided themselves, and having rush'd in at
both Doors at the same time, they seiz'd all the four men
before they were aware, or had time to lay hold of their
Arms: They did indeed what Men could do, and one of
them snapp'd a pistol at Mr Fea, but it did not go off; and
Mr Fea snatching at the Pistol at the same Moment to
divert the Shot if it had fir'd, struck his Hand with such
force against the Cock, as very much bruised his Hand.
They were all five now in his Power, and he sent them
away under a good Guard to a Village in the middle of the
Island, where they were kept separate from one another,
and sufficiently secur'd. Then Mr Fea despatch'd Ex-
presses to the Gentlemen in the neighbouring Islands to
acquaint them with what he had done, and to desire their
speedy Assistance; also desiring earnestly that they would
take care than no Boat should go within reach of the Pi-
rate's Guns; and at Night he, Mr Fea, caus'd Fires to be
made upon the Hills round him, to allarm the Country,
and ordered all the Boats round the Island to be haul'dup
upon the Beach as far as was possible, and disabled also,
lest the Pirates should swim from the Ship and get any of
them into their Possession.
Next Day, the i4th, it blew very hard all Day, and in
the Evening, about High Water, it shifted to W.N.W.,
upon which the Pirates set their Sails, expecting to get off,
and so to lay it round the Island, and put out to Sea; but
the Fellow who was order'd to cut the Cable missing seve-
ral strokes the Cable check'd the Ships Way, and conse-
quently, on a sudden, she took all a-back; then the Cable
being parted,when it should have held, the Ship ran direct-
ly on shore on the Calf Island; nor could all their Skill pre-
vent it. Then Gow, with an air of Desperation, told them
they were all dead Men: Nor indeed could it be otherways,
for having lost the only Boat they had, and five of their
best Hands, they were able to do little or nothing towards
getting their Ship off; besides, as she went on Shore, on
the Top of High Water, and a Spring Tide, there was no
Hope of getting her off afterward: Wherefore the next
morning, being Monday, the i5th, they hung out a white
Flag as a Signal for a Parley, and sent a Man on Shore,
upon Calf Island, for now they cou'd go on shore out of
the Ship almost at half Flood.
Now Mr Fea thought he might talk with Gow in a dif-
ferent Style from what he did before, so he wrote a Letter
to him, wherein he complain'd of the rude Behaviour of
his five Men, for which he told him he had been oblig'd
to seize on them and make them Prisoners, letting him
know that the Country, being all allarm'd, would soon be
too many for him; and therefore advis'd him to surrender
himself Peaceably, and be the Author of a quiet Surrender
of the reft, as the only Means to obtain any Favour; and
then he might become an Evidence against the rest, and
so might save his own Life.
This letter Mr Fea sent by a Boat with four armed
Men to the Island, to be given to the Fellow thatGow had
sent on Shore, and who waited there; and he at the same
time gave them a Letter from Gow to Mr. Fea; for now
he was humble enough to Write, which before he re-
fused.
Gow's letter to Mr Fea was to let him have some Men
and Boats to take out the best of the Cargoe, in order to
lighten the Ship and set her afloat; and offering himself to
come on Shore and be Hostage, for the Security of the
Men and Boats, and to give Mr Fea a thousand Pounds
in Goods for the Service: Declaring at the same time, if
this small Succour was refus'd him, he would take care no
Body should better himself by his Misfortune; for that
rather than to be taken, they would set Fire to the ship,
and would all Perish together.
Mr Fea reply'd to this Letter, That he had a Boat in-
deed, that would have been fit for his Service, but that she
was stav'd and sunk; but if he would come on Shore quiet-
ly without Arms, and bring his Carpenter with him to re-
pair the Boat, he might have her. This Mr Fea did to give
Gow an Opportunity to embrace his first offer of Surren-
dering. But Gow was neither Humble enough to come in,
nor Sincere enough to treat with him fairly, if he had in-
tended to let him have the Boat; and if he had, 'tis proba-
ble that the former Letter had made the Men Suspicious
of him; So that now he could do nothing without com-
municating it to the rest of the Crew.
About four in the Afternoon Mr Fea received an An-
swer to his last Letter: The Copy of which is exactly as
follows:—
"From on Board our Ship the
"Revenge, Feb. i6, i725.
"Honour'd SIR,
"I am sorry to hear of the irregular Proceedings of my
"Men. I gave no Orders to that Effect. And what hath
"been wrongfully done to the Country was contrary to
"my Inclination. It is my Misfortune to be in this Condi-
tion at present: It was in your Power to have done Other-
"wise in making my Fortune better. Since my being in
"the Country I have wrong'd no Man, nor taken any
"Thing but what I have paid for. My Design in coming
"was to make the Country the better, which I am still cap-
"able to do, providing you are just to me. I thank you for
"the Concern you have had for my bad Fortune; and am
"sorry I cannot embrace your Proposal, as being Evi-
dence; my People have already made use of that Ad-
vantage. I have by my last signified my Design of Pro-
ceeding, provided I can procure no better Terms.
"Please to send James Laing on board to continue till my
"return. I should be glad to have the good Fortune to
"commune with you upon that Subject. I beg you will as-
sist me with a Boat; and be assured I do no Man Harm,
"wer'tin my Power, as I am now at your Mercy. I cannot
"surrender myself Prisoner; I'd rather commit my self to
"the Mercy of the Seas: So that if you will incline to con-
"tribute to my Escape, shall leave you Ship and Cargo at
"your Disposal.
"I continue, honour'd Sir, &c,
John Smith."
Upon this Letter, and especially that Part wherein
Gow desires to commune with him, Mr Fea believing he
might do some Service in perswading him to submit, went
over to Calf Island, and went on Shore alone, ordering his
Boat to lie in readiness to take him in again, but not one
Man to stir out of her: And calling to Gow with a Speak-
ing-Trumpet, desir'd him to come on Shore, which the
other readily did: But Mr Fea, before he ventur'd, wisely
foresaw, that whilst he was alone, upon the Island, the
Pirates might unknown to him, get from the Ship by dif-
ferent Ways, and, under Cover of Shore, might get be-
hind and surround him; to prevent which, he set a Man
upon the top of his own House, which was on the opposite
Shore, and overlook'd the whole Island, and order'd him
to make Signals with his Flag, waving his flag once for
every Man that he saw come on Shore; but if four or more
came on Shore, then to keep the Flag waving continually,
till he, Mr Fea, should retire.
This Precaution was very needful, for no sooner was
MrFtfaadvanc'duponthe Island, expecting Gowtocome
on Shore, to meet him; but he saw a Fellow come from
the Ship with a white Flag, and a Bottle, and a Glass, and
a Bundle; then turning to his own House, he saw hisMan
make the Signals appointed, and that the Man kept the
flag continually waving; upon which he immediately re-
tir'd to his Boat, and he no sooner got into it, but he saw
five Fellows running under Shore, with lighted Matches
and Granadoes in their Hands, to have Intercepted him,
but seeing him'out of their Reach, they retir'd to the Ship.
After this the Fellow with the white Flag came up,
and gave Mr Fea two Letters; he would have left the
Bundle, which he said was a present to Mr Fea; and the
Bottle, which he said, was a Bottle of Brandy, but Mr
Fea would not take them; but told the Fellow his Captain
was a treacherous Villain, and he did not doubt but he
should see him hang'd; and as to him, the Fellow, he had
a great Mind to shoot him; upon which the Fellow took
to his Heels, and Mr Fea being in his Boat, did not think
it worth while to land again to pursue him. This put an
End to all Parlee for the present. But had the Pirates suc-
ceeded in this Attempt, they would have so far gained
their Point, either they must have been Assisted, or Mr
Fea must have been Sacrific'd.
The Two Letters from Gow were one for Mr Fea, and
the other for his Wife, the first was much to the same Pur •
pose as the former; only that in this, Gow requested the
great Boat with her Masts and Sails and Oars, with some
Provisions, to transport themselves whither they thought
fit to go for their own Safety; offering to leave the Ship and
Cargo to Mr Fea, and threatening, that if the Men of
War arrived (for Mr Fea had given him Notice that he
expected two Men of War) before he was thus assisted,
they would set Fire to the Ship and blow themselves up;
so that as they had liv'd they would all dye together.
The Letter to Mrs Fea, was to desire her to Intercede
with her Husband; and pleading that he was their Coun-
tryman, and had been her Husband's School-fellow, &c.
But no Answer was returned to either of these letters.
On the i7th, in the Morning, contrary to Expectation,
Gow himself came on Shore, upon the Calf-Island un-
arm'd, except his Sword, and alone, except one Man at
a distance, carrying a white Flag, making Signals for a
parlee.
Mr Fea, who by this time had gotten more People
about him, immediately sent one Mr Fea of Whitehall,
and a Gentleman of his own Family, with five other Per-
sons, well Armed, over to the Island, with Orders to se-
cure Gow, if it was possible, by any means, either Dead or
Alive. When they came on Shore, he proposed that one
of them, whose Name was Scollary, a Master of a Vessel,
should go on Board the Ship, as Hostage for this Gow's
Safety; and Scollary consenting, Gow himself conducted
him to the Ships side.
Mr Fea, perceiving this from his own House, immedi-
ately took another Boat, and went over to the Island him-
self: And while he was expostulating with his Men, for
letting Scollary go for Hostage, Gow return'd; and Mr
Fea made no Hesitation, but told him, in short, he was his
Prisoner; at which Gow starting, said, it ought not to be
so, since there was a Hostage delivered for him. Mr Fea
said he gave no Order for it, and it was what they could
not Justify; and since Scollary had ventured without Or-
ders, he must take his Fate; he would run the Venture of
it, but advis'd Gow, as he expected good Usage himself,
that he would send the Fellow who carryed his white Flag,
back to the Ship, with Orders for them to return Scollaryin
safety, and to desire PFinterznd Peterson to come withhim.
Gow declin'd giving any such Orders; but the Fellow
said he would readily go and fetch them, and did so, and
they came along with him. When Gow saw them, he re-
proach'd them for being so easily imposed, and order'd
them to go back to the Ship immediately. But Mr Fea\
Men, who were too strong for them, surrounded them,
and took them all. When this was done, they demanded
Gow to deliver his Sword, but he said he would rather dye
with it in his Hand, and begg'd them to shoot him: But
that was deny'd; and Mr Fea's Men, disarming him of
his Sword, carriedhim with the other two, into their Boat,
and after that to the main Island, where Mr Fea liv'd.
Having thus secur'd the captain, Mr Fea prevailed
with him to go to the Shore over-against the Ship, and to
call the Gunner and another Man to come on Ashore on
Calf-Island, which they did; but they was no sooner there,
but they also were surrounded by some Men, which Mr
Fea had placed out of sight upon the Island for that Pur-
pose; Then they made Gow to call to the Carpenter to
come on Shore, still making them believe they should
have a Boat, and Mr Fea went over and met him alone,
and talking to him, told him they could not repair the
Boat without Help, and without Tools, so perswadedhim
to go back to the Ship, and bring a Hand or two with him,
and some Tools, some Ockham, Nails, &c. The Carpen-
ter, being thus deluded, went back, and brought a French-
man and another with him, with all Things proper for
their Work; all which, as soon as they came on Shore,
were likewise seiz'd and secured by Mr Fea and his Men.
But there was still a great many Men in the Ship, who
it was necessary to bring, if possible, to a quiet Surrender.
So Mr Fea order'd his Men to make a Feint as if they
would go to Work upon the great Boat which lay on Shore
upon the Island, but in sight of the Ship; there they ham-
mer'd, and knock'd, and made a Noise, as if they were
really caulking and repairing her, in order to her being
launch'd off and put into their Possession. But towards
Night he oblig'd Gow to write to the Men that Mr Fea
would not deliver the Boat till he was in Possession of the
Ship; and therefore he order'd them all to come on Shore,
without Arms, and in a peaceable manner.
This occasioned many Debates in the Ship; but as
they had no Officers to guide them, and were all in Con-
fusion, they knew not what to do: So after some time, be-
wailing their hard Fate, and dividing what Money was
left in the Ship among them, they yielded, and went on
Shore, and were all made Prisoners, to the number of
eight-and-twenty, including those who were secur'd be-
fore.
How he brought Gow to be so weak was something
strange; Gow being not very supple and far from being
sufficiently humble: But whether it was that he hoped to
fare the better for it, and to plead some Merit by obliging
his Men to come in without Blood and perhaps they might
encourage him in such Expectations, tho' not promise
him, for the last they could not.
Or whether it was that Gow, who knew their Circum-
stances and Temper also, was satisfy'd if he did not per-
swade them to it, they would certainly do it without any
Persuasion in a Day or two more, having, indeed, no
other Remedy, and some of them beingreally forced Men,
desiring nothing more than to surrender.
And if it was neither of these, perhaps Gow, whose
Case was now desperate, and who was fully in the Power
of his Enemies, and in the Hands of Justice himself, from
whom he had indeed no reason to expect any Favour, was,
perhaps I say, he was not over-desirous to have the rest
make their Escape, and therefore was easier to perswade
them to put themselves into the same unhappy Circum-
stances with himself; it being most Natural to People in
such Circumstances to desire to have their Comrades en-
gulfed in the same Misery.
Be it which of these it will, Mr Fea did certainly prevail
vol. ii p
with Gow to be the Instrument to write to them, and to
joyn, as it were, with Mr Fea's Stratagem to draw them
on Shore, without which they had not come, at least not
at that Time, and so they said afterwards, upbraiding
him with having betray'd them; and yet it seems plain
too, that when they went they took it for granted that
they should be made Prisoners, by their Exclamations
one to another, and by their sharing the Money among
them, as is said above.
It was indeed a most agreeable Sight, to see such a
Crew of desperate Fellows so tamely surrender to a few
almost naked Countrymen, and to see them so Circum-
vented by one Gentleman that they were rendered quite
Useless to themselves, and to their own Deliverance; the
want of a Boat was as much to them as an actual Imprison-
ment; nay, they were indeed in Prison in their Ship, nor
was they able to stir one way or other, Hand or Foot; it
was too Cold to swim over to the Island and seize the
Boat,and if they had, unless they had done it immediately
at first, the People on Shore would have been too strong
for them; so that they were as secure on board the Ship, as
to any Escape they could have made, as they were after-
wards in the Condemn'd Hold in Newgate.
Again, never were People more foolishly Circumvent-
ed when they had a Boat and Conveniences, for had they
gone on Shore then, while they had a Boat, tho' it was but
their small Boat, yet going at twice, twenty or five and
twenty Men of them, they mighthaverepair'dandlaunch-
ed Mr Fea's great Boat, in spite of all he could have done
to hinder it, and then, if they could not have got their Ship
off, they might have come away, as the Fellows did, with
their own Boat, and might soon have found Means to get
a bigger Boat on the Coast, either of Scotland or England,
and getting on Shore in the Night, in any convenient Part
of England, might have dispers'd and mixt themselves
among the People, and made an effectual Escape.
But their End was apparently at hand; Justice was
ready for them; their Crimes had ripen'd them for the
Gallows, and the Gallows claim'd them; their Time was
come, and it was not in their Power to avoid it.
I am longer upon this particular Part because it is so
very remarkable, and the Circumstances of it are so un-
accountable; That the Boatswain should come on Shore
with his Boat, and no more but four Men, thinking to fire
and plunder Mr Fea's House with that little Crew; as if
he could imagine Mr Fea, who they knew was alarm'd
and had been acquainted with what they were, should
have no Body at all with him, or that he could storm his
House with that little Force.
Then that he should be wheedled into an Ale House
by a single Gentleman; as if he would have ventur'd him-
self into an Ale House with them if he had not had help at
Hand to rescue him if any thing had been offered to him.
Then, which was still worse, that they should be taken
with the old Bite of having the Gentleman call'd out of
the Room, when they were together, as if he could have
any Business to talk of there but to lay a Trap for them,
and which, if they had their Eyes about them, or, as we
might say, any Eyes in their Heads, they might have seen
into easily enough.
And to conclude this scene of Madness and Folly to-
gether, they came all away and left their Boat, with no
Body either in her to keep her a-float, or near her to guard
and defendher: Nothing butMeninfatuatedtotheirown
Destruction, and condemn'd by the visible Handof Hea-
ven to an immediate Surprize, could have been so stupid;
they might have been sure, if there were any People in the
Island, they would if possible secure their Boat; and they
ought at least to have considered the forlorn Condition of
the rest of their Company in the Ship, without a Boat to
help themselves: But blinded by their inevitable Fate, in
a Word, they run into the Snare with their Eyes open;
they stood as itwere,lookingon,andsawthemselvestaken
before it was done.
Nay, some of the Men were heard to say, that if their
Captain, Gow himself, had but said the Word, they were
able to have built a Boat on Board, with such stuff as they
could have pull'd from the Sides and Ceilings of theShipt
at least big enough to have gone out to Sea, and sailing
along the Coast, have either found a better, or seiz'dupon
some other Vessel in the Night, or to have made their
Escape.
But never Creatures were taken so tamely, trick'd so
easily, and so entirely disabled from the least Defence, or
the least Contrivance for their Escape; even GoTOhimself,
who, as I said before, never wanted a resolute Courage or
Presence of Mind before, and was never daunted by any
Difficulties, yet was now snapp'd under a pretence of a
Hostage, delivered, and being himself taken and dis-
arm'd, yields himself to be made a Tool of to bring all the
rest to yield at Discretion.
I n a word, they were as void of Counsel as of Courage;
they were outwitted on every Occasion; they could not
see in the open Day what any one else would have felt in
the Dark; but they dropp'd insensibly into Mr Fea's
Hand by one, and two, and three at a time, as if they had
told him before hand, that if he went on with his Strata-
gem, he should be sure to have them all in his Custody
very quickly: And tho' every one, as fast as they went on
Shore, were made Prisoners, and secur'd, yet the other
were made to believe they were at Liberty, and were sim-
ple enough to come on Shore to them.
Every thing we can say of the blindness and folly of
these People, who Heaven having determin'd to Punish-
ment, demented and blinded to preparethemfortheir be-
ing brought to it, I say, everything that can be said to ex-
pose their Stupidity and blindness, is a just Panegyrick
upon the Conduct of that Gentleman, by whose happy
Conduct, and the dexterous Turn he gave to every Inci-
dent which happen'd in the whole Affair, was indeed the
principal Means of their being all apprehended.
Had this Gentleman, knowing their Strength and
Number was so great, being four times as many Men as
he had about him, and better provided for Mischief, than
he was for Defence; had he, as it seems others did, fled
with his Family over the Firth, or Arm of the Sea, which
parted his Island from the rest, by which they had secur'd
themselves from Danger; or had he, with the few Men
and Fire Arms which he had about him, fortified and de-
fended themselves in his House, and resolv'd to defend
themselves there, the Pirates had in all probability gone
off again, left him, and made their Escape: Nay, if they
had run their Ship a-ground, as they afterwards did, and
tho' they had been obliged to lay the Bones there, they
would, however, have got away some Boat off the Shore
to have made a Long-boat of, and havemade their Escape
along the Coast, till they came to Newcaslle upon Tyne,
and there nothing had been more easy than to have sepa-
rated and gone to London, some in one ship, some in an-
other ; or, as one of thempropos'd, they should have found
some Coasting Bark or other riding near the Shore, which
they might have boarded, and so gone off to Sea which
way they pleas'd.
But they were come a great Way to bring themselves
to Justice, and here they met with it in the most remark-
able Manner, and with such Circumstances as I believe
are not to be imitated in the World.
When they were all on Shore, and were told that they
were Prisoners, they began to re assume a kind of Cou-
rage, and to look upon one another, as if to lay hold of
some Weapons to resist; and 'tis not doubted but if they
had had Arms then in their Hands, they would have made
a desperate Defence. But it was too late, the thing was all
over, they saw their Captain and all their Officers in the
same Condition, and there was no room for Resistance
then; all they could have done had been only to cause
them to be the more effectually secur'd, and perhaps to
have had some or other of them knock'd on the Head for
Example; so seeing there was no Remedy they all sub-
mitted quietly, and were soon dispers'donefromanother,
till more Strength came to carry them off, which was not
long.
Thus ended their desperate Undertaking, Heaven
having by a visible Infatuation upon themselves, and a
Concurrence of other Circumstances, brought them all
into the Hands of Justice, and that by the particular Bra-
very and Conduct of one Gentleman, I mean Mr Fea,
who so well manag'd them, that, as above, having at first
but five or six Men with him, he brought the whole Com-
pany, partly by Force and partly by Stratagem, to sub-
mit, and that without any loss of Blood on one side or
other.
Among the rest of the Papers found on board the Ship,
was the following Copy of a Draft, or Agreement of Arti-
cles or Orders, or what you please to call them, which
were to have been sign'd, and were for the Direction of
the Men, whether on Shore or on Board, when they came
to an Anchor in the Orkneys.
They would, I suppose, have been put up upon the
Mainmast if they had had longer time; but they soon
found Articles were of no Value with such Fellows; for
the going away with the Long-boat, and ten Men in her,
confounded all their Measures, made them jealous and
afraid of one another, and made them act afterwards as if
they were under a General Infatuation or Possession, all-
ways Irresolute and Unsettled, void of any Forecast or
reasonable Actings; but having the Plunder of MrFea's
House in their View, when they should have chiefly re-
garded their own Safety and making their Escape; they
push'd at the least Significant, tho' most difficult Part,
and which was their Ruin in the Undertaking, when they
should at first have secured their Lives, which, at least to
them, was the Thing of most Value, tho' the easiest at
that Time to have secur'd.
By this preposterous Way of Proceeding they drew
themselves into the Labyrinth and weredestroy'd, without
any possibility of Recovery; nay, they must have perish'd
by Hunger and Distress, if there had been no Body to
have taken them Prisoners; for having no Boat to supply
them with Necessaries, their Ship fast a-ground upon a
barren and uninhabited Island, andnowaytobesupply'd,
they were themselves in the utmost Despair, and I think
it was one of the kindest Things that could be done for
them, to bring them off, and hang them out of the way.
Their foolish Articles were as follows, (viz.)
I. That every Man shall obey his Commander in all
Respects, as if the Ship was his own, and weunder Month-
ly Pay.
II. That no Man shall give or dispose of the Ship's
Provisions, whereby may be given Reason of Suspicion
that every one hath not an equal Share.
III. That no Man shall open or declare to any Person
or Persons what we are, or what Design we are upon; the
Offender shall be punish'd with Death upon the spot.
IV. That no Man shall go on Shore till the Ship is off
the Ground and in readiness to put to Sea.
V. That every Man shall keep his Watch Night and
Day, and precisely at the Hour of Eight leave off Gaming
and Drinking, every one repair to their respective Sta-
tions.
VI. Whoever Offends shall be punish'd with Death,
or otherwise, as we shall find proper for our Interest.
N.B. This Draft of Articles seems to be imperfect, and
as it were only begun to be made, for that there were seve-
ral others intended to be added, but it was suppos'd that
their Affairs growing desperate, their Long-Boat gone,
and the Boatswain and Boat's Crew, in the Pinnace or
smaller Boat gone also, and made Prisoners, there was no
more need of Articles, nor would any-Body be bound by
them if they were made; so the farther making of Orders
and Articles was let alone.
These that were made were written with Gow's own
Hand, and 'tis suppos'd that the rest would have been
done so too, and then he would have taken care to have
them executed; but he soon found there was no Occasion
of them, and I make no Question but all their other Pa-
pers and Articles of any kind were destroy'd.
Being now all secur'd and in Custody in the most pro-
per Places in the Island, Mr Fea took care to give Notice
to the proper Officers in the Country, and by them to the
Government at Edenburgh, in order to get help for the
carrying them to England. The Distance being so great,
this took up some Time, for the Government at Eden-
burgb being not immediately concern'd in it, but rather
the Court of Admiralty of Great Britain, Expresses were
dispatch'd from thence to London, that his Majesty's
Pleasure might be known; in return to which, Orders
were dispatch'd into Scotland to have them immediately
sent up to England, with as much Expedition as the Case
would admit; and accordingly they were brought up by
Land to Edenburgh first, and from thence being put on
Board the Greyhound Frigate, they were brought by Sea
to England.
This necessarily took up a great deal of Time, so that
had they been wise enough to improve the Hours that
were left, they had almost half a year's time to prepare
themselves for Death; tho' they cruelly deny'd the poor
Mate a few Moments to commend his Soul to God's
Mercy, even after he was half Murther'd before: I say,
they had almost half a year, for they were most of them in
Custody the latter end of January, and they were not
Executed till the i ith of June.
The Greyhound arriv'd in the River the 2 6th, of March,
and the next day came to an Anchor at Woolwich, and the
Pyrates being put into Boats appointed to receive them,
with a strong Guard to attend them, were brought on
shore the 30th, convey'd to the Marshalsea Prison in
Southwark, where they were deliver'd to the Keeper of
the said Prison, and were laid in Irons, and there they had
the Mortification to meet their Lieutenant Williams, who
was brought home by the Argyle Man of War from Lis-
bon, and had been committed to the same Prison for a
very few days.
Indeed, as it was a Mortification to them, so it was
more to him; for tho' he might be secretly pleas'd that
those who had so Cruelly, as he caWd it, put him into the
Hands of Justice by the sending him to Lisbon, were
brought into the same Circumstances with himself, yet,
on the other hand, it could not but be a terrible Mortifica-
tion to him that here now were sufficient Witnesses found
to prove his Crimes upon him, which were not so easie to
be had before.
Being thus laid fast, it remain'd to proceed against
them in due form, and this took up some longer time still.
On Friday, the 2nd of April, they were all carried to
Dolors-Commons, where, the proper Judges being pre-
sent, they were examin'd, by which Examination due
Measures were taken for the farther Proceedings; for as
they were not equally Guilty, so it was needful to deter-
mine who it was proper to bring to an immediate Tryal,
and who being less Guilty, were more proper Objects of
the Governments Clemency, as being under force and
fear, and consequently necessitated to Act as they did;
and also who it might be proper to single out as Evidence
against the rest; after being thus Examin'd, they were re-
manded to the Marshalsea.
On Saturday, the 8 th of May, the five who were ap-
pointed for Evidence against the rest, and whose Names
are particularly set down in its Place, were sent from the
Marshalsea Prison in Newgate, in order to give their In-
formations.
Be1ng thus brought up to London, and committed to
the Marshalsea Prison, and the Government being fully
inform'd what black uncommon Offenders they were, it
was thought proper to bring them to speedy Justice.
In order to this, some of them, as is said, who were less
Criminal than the rest, and who apparently had been
forc'd into their Service, were formed out, and being ex-
amin'd, and giving first an Account of themselves and
then of the whole Fraternity, it was thought fit to make
use of their Evidence for the more clear detecting and
convincing of the rest. These were George Dobson, John
Phinnes, Timothy Murphy, William Booth.
These were the principal evidence, and were indeed
more than sufficient; for they so exactly agreed in their
evidence, and the prisoners (pirates) said so little in their
defence, that there was no room for the jury to question
their guilt, or to doubt the truth of any part of the account
given in.
Robert Read was a young man (mentioned above)
who escap'd from the Boat in the Orkneys, and getting a
Horse at a Farmer's House, was convey'd to Kirkwall,
the chief Town of the said Orkneys, where he surrendered
himself: Nevertheless he was brought up with the rest as
a Prisoner, nor was he made use of as Evidence, but was
try'd upon most, if not all, the Indictments with the rest.
But Dobson, one of the Witnesses, did him the Justice to
testifie that he was forc'd into their Service, as others
were, for fear of having their Throats cut, as others had
been serv'd before their Faces; and that, in particular, he
was not present at, or concern'd in, any of the Murthers
for which the rest were Indicted; upon which Evidence
he was Acquitted by the Jury.
Also he brought one Archibald Sutor, the Man of the
House, said above to be a Farm-House, whither the said
Read made his Escape in the Orkneys, who testified that
he did so Escape to him, and that he begg'd him to pro-
cure him a Horse to ride off to Kirkwall, which he did,
and that there he surrender'd himself. Also he testified
that Read gave him (Sutor) a full Account of the Ship, and
of the Pirates that were in her, and what they were; and
he {Sutor) discover'd it all to the Collector of the Customs;
by which means the Country was alarm'd: And he added,
that it was by this Man's means that all the Prisoners were
apprehended; (tho' that was a little too much too) for 'tis
plain it was by the Vigilance and Courage of Mr Fea
chiefly: They were reduc'd to such Distress as oblig'd
them to surrender.
However, it was true that Read's Escape did allarm
the Country, and that he merited very well of the Publick
for the timely Discovery he made: So he came off clear,
as indeed it was but Just; for he was not only forc'd to
serve them (as above) but as Dobson testified for him, he
had often express'd his Uneasiness, as being oblig'd to
act with them, and that he wish'd he cou'd get away; and
that he was Sincere in those Wishes, as appear'd in that
he took the first Opportunity he could get to put it in
Practice.
N.B. This Dobson was one of the ten Men who ran
away with the Pirates' Long-Boat from the Orkneys, and
who were afterwards made Prisoners in the Firth of Leigh
and carried to Edinburgh.
Gow was now a Prisoner among the reft in the Mar-
shalsea; his Behaviour there was Sullen and Reserv'd ra-
ther than Penitent: It had been hinted to him by Mr Fea,
as others, that he should endeavour, by his Behaviour, to
make himself as Evidence against others, and to merit his
Life by a ready Submission, and obliging others to do the
like. But Gow was no Fool, and he easily saw there were
too many gone before who had provided for their own
Safety at his Expence. And besides that, he knew himself
too deeply guilty of Cruelty and Murther to be excepted
by the public Justice as an Evidence, especially where so
many other less Criminals weretobehad. This, I say, made
him, and with good Reason too, give over any Thoughts
of Escaping by such means as that: And perhaps seeing
so plainly that there was no Room for it, might be the
Reason why he seemed to reject the Offer; otherwise he
was not a Person, of such nice Honour as that we should
suppose he would not have secur'd his own Life at the
Expence of his Comrades.
But, as I say, Gow was no Fool. So he seem'd to give
over all Thought of Life, from the first time he came to
England; not that he shew'd any Tokens of his Repent-
ance, or any Sense of his Condition, suitable to what was
before him; But continuing (as above) Sullen and re-
serv'd, even to the very time he was brought to the Bar:
When he came there, he could not be try'd with the rest;
for the Arraignment being made in the usual Form, he re-
fused to Plead. The Court usedall the Arguments which
HumanityDicl;atesinsuch Cases, toprevailonhimtocome
into the ordinary Course of other People in like Govern-
ment, laying before him the Sentence of the Law in such
Cases, namely, that he must be press'd to Death, the only
torturing Execution which remains in our Law, which,
however, they were oblig'd to Inflict.
But he continued Inflexible, and carryed on his Ob-
stinacy to such a height, as to receive the Sentence in
Form, as usual in such Cases, the Execution being ap-
pointed to be done the next Morning, and he was carryed
back to Newgate in order to it: But whether he was pre-
vailed with by Argument, and the Reasons of those about
him, or whether the Apparatus for the Execution and the
manner of the Death he was to dye terrified him, we can-
not say; but the next Morning he yielded, and petitioned
to be allow'd to Plead, and be admitted to be try'd in the
ordinary Way; which being granted, he was brought to
the Bar by himself, and pleaded, being arraign'd again
upon the same Indictment, upon which he had been sen-
enc'd as a Mute, and was found Guilty.
Williams, the Lieutenant,who, as has been said, was
put on Board a Brislol Ship, with Orders to deliver him on
Board the first English Man of War they should meet
with; comes, of course, to have the rest of his History
made up in this Place.
The Captain of the Brislol Ship, tho' he receiv'd his
Orders from the Crew of Pirates and Rogues, whose In-
structions he was not oblig'd to follow, and whose Accu-
sation of Williams, they were not oblig'd to give credit to,
yet punctually obey'd the Order and put him on Board
the Argyle. Captain Bowler, then lying in the Port of Lis-
bon, and bound for England, who, as they took him in
Irons, kept him so, and brought him to England in the
same Condition.
But as the Pirates did not send any of their Company,
nor indeed could they do it, along with him, to be Evi-
dence against him; and the Men who went out of the Pi-
rate Ship on Board a Brislol Ship being till then kept as
Prisoners on Board the Pirate Ship, and perhaps could
not have said enough, or given particular Evidence suffi-
cient to convict him ina Court of Justice, Providence sup-
ply'd the Want, by bringing the whole Crew to the same
Place (for Williams was in the Marshalsea Prison before
them), and by that means furnishing sufficient Evidence
against Williams also, so that they were all try'd together.
In Williams'?, Case the Evidence was as particular as
in Gow's; and Dobson and the others swore positively,
that Williams boasted that after Macaulay had cut the
Super Cargo's throat imperfectly, he {Williams) did his
Business, that is to say, murthered him; and added, that
he would not give him Time to say his Prayers, but shot
him thro' the Head: Phinnes and Timothy Murphy testify-
ing the same. And to show the bloody Disposition of this
Wretch, William Booth testified that Williams propos'd
afterwards to the Company, that if they took any more
Ships, they should not incumber themselves with the
Men, having already so many Prisoners, that in Case of a
Fight they should take them and tye them back to back,
and throw them all over board into the Sea.
It should not be omitted here also in the Case of Gow
himself, that as I have observ'd in the Introduction, that
Gow had long meditated the kind of Villainy which he
now put in Practice, and that it was his Resolution to turn
Pyrate the first Opportunity he should get, whatever Voy-
age he undertook, and that I observ'd he had intended it
on Board a Ship in which he came home from Lisbon, but
fail'd only for want of making a sufficient Party; so this
Resolution of his, is Confirm'd by the Testimony and
Confession of James Belvin, one of his fellow Criminals,
who upon the Tryal declar'd that he knew that Gow (and
he added the Crew of the George Galley) had a Design to
turn Pyrates from the beginning, and added, that he dis-
cover'd it to George Dobson in Amslerdam, before the Ship
went out to sea; for the Confirmation of this, Dobson was
call'd up again, after he had given his Evidence upon the
Tryals, and being confronted with Belvin, he did acknow-
ledge that Belvin had said so, and that in particular he had
said, the Boatswain and several Others had such a De-
sign to murther the Master and some Others, and run
away with the Ship; and being ask'd what was the Rea-
son why he did not immediately discover it to the Master
Captain Ferneau; he answer'd, that he heard him (Belvin)
tell the Mate of it, and that the Mate told the Captain of"
it; but that the Captain made light of it; but that tho' he
was persuaded not to let the Boatswain go along with
them, yet the Captain said, he fear'd them not, and would
still take him; but that the Boatswain finding himselfDis^
cover'd, refus'd to go; upon which Gow was named for
Boatswain, but was made second Mate, and then Belvin
was made Boatswain; and had he been as Honest after-
ward as before whereas, on the contrary, he was as for-
ward and active as any of them, except that he was not in
the first seeret, nor in the Murthers, he migh t have escap'd
what afterwards became so justly his Due; But as they
Acted together, Justice requir'd they should Suffer, and
accordingly Gow and Williams, Belvin, Melvin, Winter,
Peterson, Rollson, Mackawley, receiv'd the Reward of their
Cruelty and Blood at the Gallows, being all Executed to-
gether the i ith of June.
N.B.—Gow, as if Providence had directed that he
should be twice Hang'd, his Crimes being of a Two-fold
nature, and both Capital; soon he was turn'd off, fell down
from the Gibbet, the Rope breaking by the Weight of
some that pull'd his Legs to put him out of Pain. He was
still alive and sensible, tho' he had Hung four Minutes,
and able to go up the Ladder the second Time, which he
did with very little Concern, and was Hang'd again;
and since that a third Time (viz.) in Chains over-against
Greenwich, as Williams is over against Blackwall.

The True & Genuine Account
of the Life and Actions of the late
JONATHAN WILD
Not made up of Fiflion and Fable,
but taken from his Own Mouth
and colle&ed from papers
of his Own Writing.
THE PREFACE
THE several absurd andridiculous Accounts which have
been Publish''d, notwithslanding early and seasonable
Caution given, of the Life and Conduit of this famous, or
if you please infamous Creature, Jonathan Wild, make a
short Preface to this Account absolutely necessary.
ITissomethingslrange, that a Man's Life should be made
a kind of a Romance before his Face, and while he was upon
the Spot to contradicl it; or, that the World should be so fond
of a formal Chimney-corner Tale, that they had rather a
Story should be made merry than true.
THE Author of this short but exacl Account of Mr. Wild
assures the World, that the greatesl Part of all that has hith-
erto appeared of this Kind, has been evidently invented and
jramed out of the Heads of the scribbling Authors, meerly to
get a Penny, without regard to Truth or Facl, or even to Pro-
bability, or without making any Conscience of their imposing
on the Credulous World.
NAT, so little Ground has there been for them, that except
there was such a Man as Jonathan Wild, that he was born at
Wolverhampton, liv'd in the Old-Bayley, was call'd a
Thief-Catcher, and was Hang'd at Tyburn, there is not one
Story printed of him that can be calFd Truth, or that is not
mingled up with so much Falshood and Fable as to smother
and drown that little Truth which is at the bottom of it.
THE following Tract does not indeed make a Jesl of his
Story as they do, or present his Hislory, which indeed is a
Tragedy of itself, in a slile of Mockery and ridicule, but in a
Method agreeable to the Facl. They that had rather have a
Falshood to laugh at, than a true Account of Things to inform
them, had besl buy the Ficlion, and leave the Hislory to those
who know how to dislinguish Goodfrom Evil.
THE Undertaker\f\ of this Work havingeasilyforeseen
that the Story of this eminent Criminal would be accept-
ible to the World',resolvedsometime ago topublish it,but
knowing at the same time it would be attempted over and
over by our Hackney Grub-street Writers, upon the old Pick-
pocket Principle of Publishing any Thing to get a Penny; they
therefore took care not only to furnish themselves with authen-
tick, andfullvouchersfor the Truth of what they have to say,
but also to have the Account of him be very particular, and
such as may answer their Title.
UPON the Assurance of their being thus provided,not only
to give a true, but also a full and compleat Account of him,
they took care to give the World an early and timely Notice
that such a Work was preparingfor the Press, in order to pre-
vent People's being impos'd upon; and to that purpose they
advertis'd this Work in several Publick Prints; and they are
satisfy'd that as on one Hand, it has prepared the World to ex-
pecl this Account, so it willfully answer their expeclation now
it appears.
THEY have not satisfy'd themselves in their Enquiries, to
take Things upon the Credit oj' Common Fame, which (gener-
ally speaking) is a Common Something; nor have they sup-
plyed, by Invention, the Particulars of what wanted such
Helps. The Life of this unhappy Wretch is too full of Inci-
dents, and that of an uncommon Nature, to stand in Need of
any such Helps; and we are so far from wanting Matter to
fill up this Tracl, and make the Story out, that on the contrary,
we are forc'd to abridge and contracl some of the mosl con-
siderable Passages of his Life, that we may bring it all into as
narrow a Compass as we can.
THE Life of Jonathan Wild is aperfeclly new Scene: as
bis Conduit has been Inimitable} so his Imployment has been
singular to him, and is like to be so, for as it began, so it is like
to dye with him; no Man among the mosl daring of the Clan
being, we believe, so hardy as to venture to take it up after
him.
EVER Y Step he took was Criminal, and the very Aclions
which he did with the greatesl openness and an avowed Pro-
fess'd Allowance, merited the Gallows even by the very Let-
ter; but pray Note, when we say Allowance, we mean his
own Allowance, for no other Power or Person could allow
him in it.
IT is true, he had an inimitable Boldness in his Behaviour
and by detecling some Criminals, he assumed a kind of Power
toprotecl others, only the difference lay here, namely, that he
did the firsl Publickly, and the lasl Privately; so that in a
Word, he served the Publick in thefir si, and abused the Pub-
lick in the second, and was only deceived in this, that be
thought his being Useful in the fir si, would protecl him in be-
ing Criminal in the lasl; but here he was, we say Mislaken,
and fell into a Snare which all his pretended Merit could not
deliver him from.
TA KE him as a Man, only he had a kind of brutal Courage
which fitted him to be an Inslrument in attacking some of the
mosl desperate of the several Gangs of Rogues he had to do
with. But as this Courage also serv'd to make him Audacious
in the other wicked Things he undertook, he was rather Bold
than couragious, and might be calFdImpudent, but we cannot
say he was Brave, as appeared in a more particular manner
in his slupid and confus'd Behaviour, during his lying in
Newgate, and at his Execution, of which in its Place.
WE have the Advantage in this Account to come at the
4
particular of his Story from unqueslioned Authority, for as he
was sensible wrong Accounts would be publish'd of him, he
was not backward to give Materials from his own Mouth
which no Body can contradicl; and others fully conversant
with him, having given the same Stories or Accounts of the
same Fads, we have the Satisfaclion to see them agree fully
together, and thereby be assured of the Truth of both; for in
such Cases there could be no Combination to deceive us.
NOT that it is possible to obtain a full Account of all the
particular Villainies of Jonathan Wild, during a series of
sixteen Years, in which he reign'd in all his Wickedness with
such Success, as no Age canproduce the like. 'Tis enough if we
give you a general View of his Life, or a Scheme of his Prac-
tice, illuslrated by Examples; which Examples likewise might
befarther set forth by more Examples and by Stories full of an
infinite variety, which if coHeeled together, would make up a
large Volume in Folio, and yet leave many of them unrelated.
IT is true, as we shall take Notice in its Place, that the
World does not charge Jonathan with being himself aclually
a Highwayman or Robber; or that when any of the Gangs of
Prancers (as they are call'd in the Newgate Cant) went out
upon the Grand Design, he ever went with them, and we are
assur'd he did not: He knew the Trade too well, to put his
Life into such a Hazard; he knew how common a Bite it was
among such People to save their own Lives at the Expense of
their companions; but he was too Cunning for that. And he
had likewise a so much better Trade in Hand, by which he
was sure to make a Prey both of the Persons Robb'd, and of
the Rogues that robb'd them; that he would have been worse
than Lunatick, if he had been drawn in to be a Party.
THE Part he acled in the Faitfor which he suffer'd, was
more than he ordinarily did, or than we everfind he ventur'd
to do before, for here he was both Thief and Thief-Catcher
too, which he did not usually venture. But a secret Infatua-
tion was now upon him,and Heavenwhohad determined his
Fate, no doubt left him to Expose himself more in this one Ac-
tion, than he had done in many Years before, and by this he
Fell.
IT is said, that if this had notfix'd him, there were other
Facls charg'd which would effettually have done; to that we
shall say nothing, because those others have not been try'd.
'Tis enough, Jonathan dy'd not in his own way of Thief-
Catching, but by going out of his Road and taking a Share in
the Robbery as he did after in the Reward: And here he was
taken in his own Snarejorthevery Thieves he employ'd, were
the Witnesses that Hang'd him. But we say no more of that,
till we come to the Story itself. We now proceed to the particu-
lar Account of his Life.
AN ACCOUNT OF
THE LIFE AND
Eminent Actions, &c.
JONATHAN WILD the wretched Subject of this
History, was born at Wolverhampton in Stafford-
shire ;andtodo Justice to his Original, his Parents, tho'
mean, had the repute of Honest and Industrious People,
his Father being a Carpenter, and his Mother sold Herbs
and Fruit in the Market of Wolverhampton: They had
three Sons, and two Daughters; the two Daughters are
yet living and Married to honest Tradesmen in Wolver-
hampton, one to a Comb-Maker, and the other a Buckle-
Maker, and whose Characters we do not hear are any way
Blemish'd; but the Sons have all a different Fame.
The Brothers I say were three in Number, Jonathan,
John and Andrew: John was a publick Officer in theTown
where they Liv'd, being the Cryer of Wolverhampton; but
stepping out of his Employment in the time of the late
Preslon Rebellion, and making himself popular by Head-
ing and appearing among the Rabble, for pulling down
the Meeting-House at Wolverhampton; he was taken up
for a Rioter, brought to L O ND O N, and put into Cus-
tody of a Messenger, where he continued some time, till
he was sent down again in Custody to Stafford, to be try'd
at the Assizes held there for the County: There he was
236 L1fe and Act1ons
Convicted, and receiv'd Sentence to be publickly Whipt,
and afterwards to lye in Prison for a certain Time, which
Sentence was accordingly Executed: But the same John
being afterwards at Liberty, the time of his Imprison-
ment being expir'd, Dyed about four Years ago, as did
also his Mother much about the same Time, that is to
say, within a Month of One another.
The younger Brother Andrew being by Trade a Birm-
ingham Ware-man, or in particular a Buckle-Maker; left
his own Country and came up to London; what Trade he
has driven here we shall not meddle with, the Man being
yet alive; and as we are not writing his Story, but that of
his elder Brother, so we are not willing to enter into any
thing that may be prejudicial to particular Persons on any
Account whatever; 'tis enough to say, that we hear he is
at this Time a Prisoner in the Poultry-Compter for Debt;
so that it seems, all the three Brothers have had some ac-
quaintance with the inside of a Goal, tho' on different
Accounts.
JONATHAN as I have said, was the eldest Brother,
he was born about the year 1683, being at the time of his
Execution, about two and forty years of Age, of which
something more than thirteen years has been spent in the
most exquisite Villainies, of which we shall give some
Account in this Work.
H1s Education was suitable to his Father's Circum-
stances, being taught in the Free-School of Wolverhamp-
ton, to read and write, and then his Father put him Ap-
prentice to a Birmingham Man, or as they call them there,
a Hardware Man, and particularly a Buckle Maker.
Authors are not agreed in the Name of his Master,
and as it is not Material, we also let it pass without any
0/JONATHAN WllD 237
Notice; having serv'd his Time out, or as some say but
part of it, he got into the Service of one Counsellor Daniei
oiStaffordshire, and came up with him to London as his
servant; this was about the year 1704. But whether he
did not please his Master, or that he took ill Courses so
early, we have not enquir'd; but that Counsellor dismiss-
inghim,hewent home again to Wolverhampton, and very
honestly work'd for some time at his Trade.
But his Thoughts, as he said, being above his Trade,
tho' at that time had he no Tast of the Life he afterwards
led, yet he grew uneasie in the Country, was sick of his
Work, and in short, after a few Years came away to Lon-
don, to see if he could get into any Business there.
Here he found but little Encouragement, and tho' he
Work'd at his Trade, yet what he could get at his day
Labour, but ill serv'd to maintain him, whose Temper
even then, was not much given to Frugality, which with
his being not enclin'd to sit very close to his Work nei-
ther, made him run out pretty much, till at length it was
his Misfortune to be Arrested for Debt, and carried to
Wood-slreet Compter.
Here he suffer'd great hardship, having no Friends to
help him out, or Money to maintain him within, so that
he was on the Common-side, and far'd as other People in
those Circumstances do fare, that is to say, very hard.
However, after having lain a long time there, he at
length having behaved himself well enough among the
Prisoners, got so much Favour with the Keepers, that he
got the Liberty of the Gate, as they call it.
H1s Business here was chiefly to attend in the Night,
in Case any Prisoners were brought in for Disorders in
the Street; to wait upon them, and guard them with the
Officers to any Justice of the Peace, and so back again if
they were Committed; and in this, he Discharg'd him-
self to Satisfaction, so that he was at length trusted to go
of Errands, and the like Liberties to get a Penny.
Among the great variety of Night-walking Offenders
which came into his Custody, at length there comes in
one Mary Milliner, who after having been carried before
a Justice, might be remanded to the Compter for the pre-
sent ; but being a Jade of some Fame, she soon found her
way out again, for we do not find she was reckoned to be a
Prisoner there at all.
Whether it was that she was frequently brought in
there in her Night Rambles, and might receive some Fa-
vours from him on that Occasion, it being much in his
way to favour such as she was, he being as a kind of Keep-
er set over them; or whether they Contracted a Friend-
ship at first sight, or what other incident brought it about
I know not; but Mr. Wild not only became acquainted
with her, but a more than common Intimacy soon grew
between them; insomuch, that she began to teach him a
great many New, and to him unknown Ways of getting
Money, and brought him into her own Gang, whether of
Thieves or Whores, or of both, is not much Material.
By the Advantage of this new Correspondence Mr.
Wild soon clear'd himself of his Imprisonment, the Debt
for which he was thrust into the Compter being but small;
and tho' he had a Wife at that time living at Wolverhamp-
ton, and had a Son by her, which Son is still living, as we
shall hear presently; and tho' this new Favourite he had
pitch'd upon, had also a Husband then living, a Water-
man by his Profession; yet they pretended to be Married
and liv'd together some time as Man and Wife, and this
we are to call his second Wife, for he had six of them in
all. This Mrs. Millineras I am inform'd is still living, so
that Mr. Wild has left several Widows behind him at his
Exit, whether they go by his Name or not, that he him-
self could not inform us.
During his Intimacy with this Mrs. Milliner, and by
her means he grew Acquainted with some other of the
wicked ways of Living which, it seems she practis'd be-
sides that of Whoring: And first it seems she carried him
out with her upon the TWANG: This is One of the
Cant Words for those who attend upon the Night-walk-
ing Ladies in their Progress, and who keep at a distance,
that if the Lady they are employ'd by, happens to fall
into any Broil, they may come in timely to her Assistance,
and making a Noise and a Quarrel, if possible fall a Fight-
ing, and so give her an Opportunity to walk off, which
Jonathan often practis'd with good Success.
He improv'd his time during his Acquaintance with
this Mary Milliner to a very great Degree, for she brought
him acquainted with several Gangs, or Societies of the
Sharping an d Thieving World, in so much, that in a little
time he knew all their several Employments, and the se-
veral Parts they Acted, their Haunts and their Walks,
how they perform'd, and how they manag'd their Effects
when they had met with Success: And as he seem'd to set
up for a Director to them, under the Government of that
Dextrous Lady his first InsTructor, so he found ways to
make himself as useful to them as if he had gone Abroad
with them, which however he always avoided: Nor, in-
deed, had he any occasion to run a Hazard himself, he
finding himself as much a gainer in the Part he Acled, as
if he had shar'd in the Adventure: So that, in a Word, He
had the Profit without the Danger; and politically kept
himself from the Last, on pretence of his encreasing the
First, by his Art in managing for them.
Thus without being a Thief or a Receiver, he brought
a Gain to himself, andhis Business went on Prosperously.
How he and his Lady parted after this, is a Story,which
has nothing Extraordinary in it; 'tis enough to say, that
Johnathan became such a Proficient in his Business, that
he stood no longer in need of her Instructions; and as she
had a Trade of her own, which he began to be sick of as-
sisting her in, they made no difficulty of separating, with
as little Ceremony as they came together.
Tho' I do not find but that they kept a kind of remote
Correspondence after they were separated, as to Cohabi-
tation ; and the other Trade was carried on with mutual
Assistance, as well as to mutual Advantage, for some
time. And here it is very Remarkable, That tho' during
this Intercourse of Mr. Wild among these loose People
(as above) many of them dayly fell into the Hand of Jus-
tice, and some went off the Stage,the High Road, (as they
call it) that is to say, by the Gallows; yet none of them had
any thing to say to Jonathan, or to his She Friend, Mrs.
Milliner: but these always did their Business so Clean,
with such Subtilty, and so much to the Advantage of the
Criminals, that it was of no Use to them to charge him or
her with any Thing.
In this dextrous way of Managing, it came frequently
in his way, where any Thing of Value was Stolen, to make
it worth more Money, both to himself and to the Thief
that had Stolen it, by his private Ways; which at the same
time the Criminal knew nothing of. The Case was thus.
It is not to be doubted, that when a Robbery was com-
mitted, the Thieves sometimes run as much Hazard in
securing what they had got, as they did in the getting of
it, and often times much more; nay, they were very often
discovered and detected in their Attempts, to turn what
they had got into Money, or to sell and dispose of it, when
they had escaped the Danger of the Fact it self, and come
off Clean.
There was a Time indeed, when there were Brokers
and Receivers, whose Business it was to take every Thing
off of their Hands as soon as they had gotten it; and a
young Shop-lifter or House-breaker had no sooner got a
Booty, but he knew where to go and carry it in, as to a
Warehouse or Repository; where he was sure to have
Money for it, and that something near the Value of it too;
and this was a great Encouragement to the Light-finger'd
Gang: So that when it was a Misfortune of a Family or
Person to lose any Goods, they were effedtually lost, and
seldom or never were they heard of any more.
But there being an Act past in the Reign of the late
King William, making it Felony to buy or receive any
Stolen Goods,knowing them to be Stolen; and one or two
bold People having suffered on that very Account; the
Receiving Trade was spoil'd all at once. And when the
poor Adventurer had, at the hazard of his Neck, gotten
any Purchase, he must run all that Hazard over again to
turn it into Money.
lTistrue,aftersometime,theTemptationbeingstrong,
andtheProfits great,there werePersons frequently found
again that did help the Adventurers and took of their
goods; but then the Thief got so small a Share, that the
Encouragement was very small; and had it continued so,
the Thieving Trade might (for ought I know) have been
vol. 11 r
242
L1fe and Act1ons
in danger of being lost: For the Receivers running so ex-
treme a Hazard, they got all the Profit; and the poor Lift-
er or House-breaker was glad to part with Things of the
greatest Value for a Trifle.
But Jonathan and his Director, soon found out a Way
to encourage the Trade again, and to make it worth while
as theycall'dit,and the first Method was this: When a
Purchase was made, Jonathan enquir'd first where it was
gotten, what House had been robb'd, or, who had lost
the Goods; and having learn'd that, his next Business was
to have the Goods deposited in proper Places, always
avoiding the receiving them himself, or bringing himself
Then he found out proper Instruments to employ to
go to the Persons, who had been robb'd, and tell them,
that if they could describe what they had lost, they be-
liev'd they could help them to them again, for that there
was a parcel of stolen Goods stopt by an honest Broker, to
whom they were offered to be sold, and if their Goods
were among them they might have them again for a small
matter of Expence.
The People who had been robb'd, it may be suppos'd
were always willing enough to hear of their Goods again,
and very thankful to the Discoverer, and so readily gave
an Account of the Things they had lost, with such proper
Descriptions of them as were needful; The next Day they
should be told; there was such or such Part of their Goods
stopt among other Goods, which it was supposed were
stolen from other People, and so upon Assurance given
on both Sides to make no Enquiry into the particular Cir-
cumstances of stopping the Goods, and a Consideration
to the Person who went between, for helping the Loser to

his Goods again,the Things were restor'd,and the Person
receiv'd abundance of Thanks and Acknowledgments
for their Honesty and Kindness; and this part always fell
to Jonathan, or his Mistress Milliner, or perhaps both,
who always pretended they got nothing for their Pains
but the Satisfaction of having help'd the People to recov-
er their own again, which was taken by a Company of Ro-
gues ; professing their Sorrow that they had not had the
good Luck at the same time to detect the Rogues that
took them, and bring them to the Punishment they de-
serv'd.
On the other hand, they acted as safe a Part with the
Thief also, for rating and reproving the Rogue for his
Villany, they would pretend to bring them to an honest
Restoring the Goods again, taking a reasonable Consid-
eration for their Honesty, and so bring them to lodge
them in such Place as should be directed; and sometimes,
as I have been told, he has officiously caused the Thief, or
Thieves, to be taken with the Goods upon them, when he
has not been able to bring them to comply, and so has
made himself both Thief and Chapman, as the Proverb
says; getting a Reward for the Discovery, and bringing
the poor Wretch to the Gallows too, and thisonly because
he could not make his Market of him to his Mind; but I
must be so just to Jonathan too, as to say he did not ac-
knowledge this, so that this Part was not had from his
own Mouth, yet perhaps it may not be the less true, nor
do I think it would be very hard to prove the Fact.
As to the other Part, he was never backward to own
that it was his early Practice, and boasted of it as doing a
piece of Service which none but himself could manage,
and that he thereby assisted honest People intherecovery
of their own; how far he acted honestly in the doing it,
supposing he had no hand in the Robbery itself, I leave
to the Casuists to determine; no Question, in their New-
gate Divinity, they might think it a mighty honest way of
getting Money, for as to the Encouragement it was to
the Robbery itself, while the Thief knew before hand
how to come off of the Guilt and get Money in his Pocket,
that they gave their Thoughts no trouble about.
This Trade I found by his own Discourse he carry'd
on a great while, and had he gone no farther, I question
whether it had been in any Man's Power to havehurthim
to the last; nay, or that even the Laws would have reach'd
his Life, notwithstanding the late Act which seem'd to be
calculated on purpose to put a stop to his Trade: But he
knew no Bounds to his Gain, and therefore knew no Re-
straint of Laws, or at least considered of none, till he in-
volved himself in a mass of Crimes, out of which it was
impossible he should recover.
But to return to the first Part of this unjust Commerce,
which, whatever Gloss he might put upon it, was no other
than an encouraging Rogues to rob and plunder, and
then demanding Money for them to bring back what
they had stolen, out of which he secur'd always a Share
for himself. ThisPracticeof giving People notice of their
Goods after they were robb'd becoming pretty Publick,
and especially several People recovering their lost Goods
u pon the easie Conditions of giving a Gratuity to the Dis-
coverer, being known, it introduced another weak fool-
ish Practice as a Consequence, namely, that after this,
when any Person was robb'd, they always publish'd the
Particulars of their lost Goods, with the Promise of a Re-
ward to those who should discover them: It [is] reason-
able indeed to suppose that this might occasion a Discov-
ery one way or other, either by the Thieves betraying one
another, or else by directing the Buyers of Goods, who
were honestly inclin'd, to stop such Goods if they came to
be offered, and hence it was a usual Practice in such Ad-
vertisements to add, that if such Goods were offered to be
sold or pawn'd, they were desir'd to stop both the Goods
and the Persons, and give notice so and so, as directed.
But this was every Way an ineffectual Method, and
indeed the latter part was particularly so, for, indeed it
was neither more or less than giving a Caution to the
Thief, not to venture to offer any thing he had gotten to
Sale, for he should be sure to be stopt as well as the Goods;
and indeed it was strange, that the People who publish'd
such Advertisements should not foresee the making such
a Publication would be an effectual shutting the Door
against the Discovery they designed it for, and was there-
fore nothing but a throwing good Money after bad.
On the other hand,neitherwas the advertizing or Pub-
lishing their Loss any real Service, or of any use to the
Loser, for that the only Person who could assist in the
Recovery of the Goods, was quite out of the Question,
having no need of the Information, but coming by his In-
telligence another Way, viz. from the Thief himself; and
that if there had been no such Information, I mean by
publick Print, he would, as usual, have been sure to have
sent an Account to the Loser, and have come to a Treaty
with him another Way; for the Thief giving an Account
to Mr. Jonathan Wild where the Robbery was commit-
ted, and whose Goods they were, the cunning Artist al-
ways made Application to the Loser first; and if it was
asked, how they come to know who the Goods were taken
from? it was always answer'd ,That it was meerly Provi-
dential; being, by meer Accident, at a Tavern, or at a
Friend's House in the Neighbourhood, they heard that
such a Gentleman had his house broken open, and such
and such Goods Stolen, and the like.
This was so plausible a Story, and carryed so much an
appearance of Truth with it, that it left Room for no En-
quiry: But on the other hand, if the People, to whom the
Discovery was made, were too Inquisitive, the Party sent,
presently seem'd to take it 111, and reply'd, Sir, I come to
serve you, if you think to make any Discovery by me, of
the Thieves that robb'd you, I must tell you, that you are
Mistaken: I converse with no such Cattle; I can give a
very good Account of my self to you, or any Body else: I
only come to tell you that some Goods, being offer'd to
Sale by a suspected Hand; the Person to whom they
were offer'd, had the Honestyto slop them, andthe Good-
ness to give you some Notice of it, that you may see whe-
ther your Goods are among them or not; if this is not
enough to oblige you, I have done. If you have any thing
to say to me, or think to talk to me about the Thief or
Thieves that robb'd you, I have no more to say to you, but
to let you know, my Name is so and so; and I live in such
a Place, if you have any thing to say to me, I am to be
found, Sir, at any Time. And thus they take their leave in
a Huff. And this never fails to bring the Enquirer to a
better Temper; and either immediately, or soon after, to
treat them with more Civility//
And indeed the offer itself appears so Good, and the
appearance so above Board, that not a Magistrate, or
Justice of Peace, could find the least Flaw in it: Only en-
quire where the Goods are which are stopt, in whichCase,
a Place and Person is named, and Goods produced when
any one is sent to view them; but then the Party so Cavil-
ing at that offer, is sure to find none of his own Goods
among them: And so being lost as it were in a Wood, he
is perfectly amused, and has not one Word to say; for he
neither sees his own Goods, nor knows that the other
Goods are stolen, much less by who or from who: And
thus by his being too Curious, or rather Impertinent, he
loses his Goods entirely, and has no second Offer made
him.
It must be confess'd, Jonathan play'd a sure Game in
all this; and therefore it is not to be wonder'd at that he
went on for so many Years without any Disaster: Nay, he
acquir'd a strange, and, indeed, unusual Reputation, for
a mighty honest Man, till his Success hardened him to
put on a Face of publick Service in it; and for that Pur-
pose, to profess an open and bare Correspondence among
the Gangs of Thieves; by which his House became an
Office of Intelligence for Enquiries of that Kind; as if all
Stolen Goods had been deposited with him, in order to be
restor'd.
But even this good Character of his, as it did not last
long, so neither did it come all at once; and some tell us
(how true it is, I will not affirm) that he was oblig'd to
give up every now and then one or two of his Clients to
the Gallows, to support his rising Reputation: In which
cases, he never fail'd to proclaim his own Credit in bring-
ing Offenders to Justice, and in delivering his Country
from such dangerous People.
Some have gone so far as to tell us the very Particulars
which recommended any of the Gangs to him for a Sacri-
fice, and to divide them into Classes: For example, (1.)
such as having committed the Secret of a Fad: to him, yet
would not submit their Purchase to his Disposal; or (2.)
would not accept reasonable Terms of Composition for
restoring the Goods; or (3 .)used any threatningSpeeches
against their Comrades: These he would immediately
cause to be apprehended, he knowing both their Haunts,
and where the Goods were deposited; and in such Cases,
none so vigilant in the Discovery, or so eager in appre-
hending the Thief: And, generally speaking, he had his
ways and means to bring in others of the Gang, to come
in and Confess, that they might Impeach the Person so
intended to be given up to Justice.
This, I say some have affirmed was his Practise, and
assured me of the Truth of it; and that in these Cases, they
add, That he managed with such Dexterity, that he al-
ways obtain'd publick Applause, as a mighty forward
Man to delect the Villanies of those People, and bring
Offenders to Justice.
How many he murthered in that manner, for as his
End was only making a Sacrifice to his own Interest and
Fame, I can call it no other: I say, how many they were, I
cannot learn; but if ithas been a Practice of somany Years
standing,and so frequent in thatTime,itcannotbedoubt-
ed but the Number has been very considerable; nor does
it a little contribute to the belief of the Thing, that the fra-
ternity of Thieves in general were of late so exasperated
against him; for tho' the Method was in it self wicked in
him, yet it certainly brought a great many Criminals to
just Condemnation, who would otherwise have liv'd to
do much more Mischief than they did.
And this occasion'd him doubtless to push on with the
more Heat and Fury against those who stood in his way,
and where he could exert his Power without fear of being
Touch'd himself, as particularly against the late J. Shep-
pard, Blueskin, and others, in the taking, re-taking, and
prosecuting of whom, he was very Officious; while at the
same time those audacious Criminals exclaim'd against
him, as a Man who had [been] the first great Encourager
of their Villanies, or at least had been instrumental to
draw them into the very Practice it self; in Revenge for
which, the said Blueskin bid fair for giving Jonathan his
quietus in the very Face of Justice. But his Fate was to dye
with more Infamy than he would have gone off with, if he
had been sent off at that Time.
But to return to the History it self, what ever was at
the bottom of his Designs, 'tis evident, he had two very
clear Pretences for what he did; and on these two Pre-
tences, it was that he supported the Credit of all his mon-
strous doings, and which indeed no Man but himself
could have shown his Face in; 1. The Publick Good, in
taking and apprehending the most open and notorious
Criminals ;and, 2.Theprocuringandrestoring the Goods
again to the right Owners, which had been stolen from
them either by Fraud or Violence.
It was allowed, that neither of these could be done ef-
fectually, as Jonathan did them, but by an avowed Inti-
macy and Acquaintance among the Gangs and Societies
of Thieves of every sort; and it was very hard to Imagine,
that such an Intimacy could be maintain'd without being
really a Party to their Management, and without a crimi-
nal Correspondence with them in the very Facts: And
Jonathan was often told so, as well by those who believed
him really guilty of such a criminal Correspondence, as
those that did not.
But be that as it will, Jonathan himself always deny'd
it, and insisted not only on his Innocence, but on his
Merit: And that as he was indeed acquainted with the
wicked ways made use of by all the several Classes of
Thieves, and by consequence with many of them Person-
ally, he only made use of that Acquaintance, to perswade
and prevail upon them, when good Rewards were offer'd
for it, to restore the Goods to the People who had lost
them; placing himself so only in the middle, between the
Loser and the Robber, as to capitulate for the latter, that
if the Goods were return'd, the Loser would keep Pro-
mise, and give a Reward without Enquiry into the Par-
ticulars, or Persons, which would otherways put an end
to all Restorings or Returnings of Stolen Goods for ever
after.
This Part he insisted on as not only very Honest but
very Serviceable; always insisting that whatever he took
on either side, was no otherwise than as a Sollicitor takes
his Fee, on Consideration from both Parties, for honestly
putting an end to a Law-suit, and bringing the contend-
ing Parties to a friendly Accommodation; and had he
gone no farther, I cannot say but hemightbeintheRight:
But he acted in a more difficult Station, as placing him-
self in the middle, between the Law and the Offender, in
a manner, commuting the Felony, and making a kind of
Composition where the Facl: wasPunishable ;whichPun-
ishment no Man had Power to anticipate, but the Hand
above, which had Power also to remit the Penalty; name-
ly, the supreame Magistrate.
It must be allow'd to Jonathan's Fame, That as he
steer'd among Rocks and dangerous Shoals, so he was a
bold Pilot; he ventur'd in, and always got out in a manner
of Jonathan W1ld 251
equally surprising; no Man ever did the like before him,
and I dare say, no Man will attempt to do the like after
him: Two Things indeed favour'd him; (1.) The wil-
lingness the Government always shows to have Criminals
Detected, and brought to Justice. And, (2 .)The Willing-
ness of the People who had been Robb'd, and lost Things
of considerable Value, to get their Goods again.
I. The willingness of the Governmentto bring Rogues
to their Reward, as well to Punish the Persons, as to dis-
courage the Crime; all just Governments discover a Dis-
position to bring Offenders to Justice: And oh this ac-
count, they not only receive and accept of Informations
of the worst of Crimes, from the worst of Criminals, and
Knowledge of the Offence from the Offenders themsel-
ves, but encourage such Criminals to come in and confess
the Offence, and Discover their Accomplices, Promising
as well Pardon for the Crimes, as a Reward for the Dis-
covery, even to those who are Guilty. Now this willing-
ness of the Government to detect Thieves, seem'd to be a
kind of Authority, for Jonathan in his vigorous persuit of
those who he thought fit to have Punished; tho' 'tis true,
it was no Authority to him to draw poor Fellows first into
the Crime, that he might afterwards obtain a Reward
from the Government for Detecting and Apprehending
them, and there indeed is the nice turn of Jonathan's
Case, and which indeed has turn'd him off of the Stage at
long run, as we shall see in its Place.
He continued in the prosperous part of his Business
about ten Year, without being so publickly taken notice
of, or making himself so famous as he has been lately; and
in this time it was not doubted but he got a large stock of
Money, as well as of Credit; and had he contented him-
self with the same Cautious wary Way of Acting, which
his first Instructor introduc'd him by, he might have
grown Rich, and been safe too; but as he was of a push-
ing, enterprizing Nature, he could content himself with
nothing but every thing he could get, nor could he act
moderately in any part of his Conduct.
In this time of his Prosperity, he Married athird Wife,
(his two former, if they were Wives, being still living) her
Name was Elizabeth Man, who tho' she was a Woman of
the Town, was yet a very sensible and agreeable Person;
and her short History is this: He lov'd her above all the
other Women he had taken for Wives, and liv'd publick-
ly with her, which he did not with any of the rest; he had
no Children by her, but she was as he himself Confess'd,
a true Penitent for all her former Life, and made him an
excellent Wife; she expiated her former bad Life by a
formal full Confession and Pennance, having on that Oc-
casion been perswaded to turn Roman Catholic, and hav-
ing receiv'd Absolution from her Confessor, liv'd a very
sober Life for some Years, after which she Died, and was
buried at St. Pancrass in the Fields; and Jonathan retain'd
such an impression of the Sanctity and goodness of this
Wife, that he never forgot it as long as he liv'd; and
order'd himself to be Buried close to her when he Died,
which his Friends took care to see perform'd, about Two
of the Clock in the Morning.
He had two Wives as they are call'd, besides this; and
after her Death, who I understand, he did not live with,
or not long at a Time, (viz.)
Sarah Parrin, alias GregsJone, who I understand is yet
living.
Judith Nun by whom he had a Daughter, who is now
about ten Years of Age, and the Mother also still liv-
Bes1des those five, he Married his Sixth and last Wife
about seven Year ago, and with whom he liv'd to the
Time of his Execution; her Maiden Name was Mary
Brown, but when he took her to Wife, her Name was
Mary Dean, being the Widow or Relict, of Skull Dean, a
Man of the Trade who was executed for House-break-
ing, that is to say, for Burglary, about the Year 1716 j or
1717: Some have tax'd Jonathan with being Instrument-
al to the Execution of this Dean, her said first Husband,
that he might have theLiberty to make Court to his Wife,
but he deny'd it possitively,and[I] see no room for such a
Reproach. I shall not reflect on his Memory, without
good Evidence.
The said Skull Dean, Mrs. Wild's, first Husband, was
a very dextrous Fellow in his Calling, and particularly
expert in breaking into Houses: After he was condemn'd
he got out of the Prison, on pretence of going to the Ne-
cessary-house, and being gotten quite clear for a little
while, he made his way as far as Guiltspur-ftreet, towards
Smithfield, but being pursued by the Keepers, and having
his Fetters on, he could not go long undiscovered, so they
over-took him, and carryed him back to Prison.
Th1s Mrs. Dean is his present apparent Relict; she
has had the mortification to have had two Husbands, and
both Hang'd; and was so affected with the Disaster of
this last, that as Jonathan himself declar'd a few Days be-
fore his Execution, she had twice attempted to destroy
herself, after she had the Account of his receiving Sen-
tence of Death.
He had no Children by this Sixth Venture; but we are
assur'd, she has been an extraordinary Wife to him on
many Accounts, and particularly in the way of his Busi-
ness, in which she could not be perfectly unacquainted,
having had so extraordinary a Husband before; tho' we
do not find that Jonathan himself wanted any Assistance,
being by this Time perfect Master of his Trade.^^
In the time of this Wife, or on the Marrying her, he
removed from his former Lodging, (a House in the Little
Old Baily, where his said Wife had liv'd before) and took
a House in the Great Old Baily, and there he liv'd to the
last; and in no mean Figure neither, for his Wife made a
very good Appearance; and as to Jonathan, he carryed on
a very flourishing Business, as the Town well knows.
He was now Master of his Trade, Poor and Rich
flock'd to him: If any Thing was Lost,(whether by Negli-
gence in the Owner, or Vigilance and Dexterity in the
Thief) away we went to Jonathan Wild. Nay, Advertise-
ments were Publish'd, directing the Finder of almost
every Thing, to bring it to Jonathan Wild, who was emi-
nently impower'd to take it, and give the Reward.
How Infatuate were the People of this Nation all this
while? Did they consider, that at the very time that they
treated this Person with such a Confidence, as if he had
been appointed to the Trade? He had, perhaps, the very
Goods in his keeping, waiting the Advertisement for the
Reward; and that, perhaps, they had been Stolen with
that very Intention?
It was not a little Difficult to give his Eminence his
true Title; he was, indeed, call'd a Thief-Catcher, and on
some extraordinary Occasions, he was so, as in the Case
of Sheppard, Blueskin, and others: But this was no Ex-
planation of his Business at all, for his Profits came in an-
other way, not in catching the Thief, but more properly,
in Catching (that is, Biting) the Persons robb'd: As for
the Thief, it was not his Business to catch him, as long as
he would be subjected to his Rules; that is to say, as often
as he had committed any robbery, to bring it to him, to be
restor'd to the Owner.
If the Correspondence he kept was large, If the Num-
ber of his Instruments was very great, his dexterity in
Managing them, was indeed wonderful: And how clea-
verly he kept himself out of the reach of the Act for re-
ceiving Stolen Goods, mentioned above, is hardly to be
Imagin'd; and yet we find he was never charg'd Home
'till now; notwithstanding so many Fellons who he ex-
asperated to the last Degree,and made Desperate, by fall-
ing upon them to their Destruction.
ItIs true, the young Generation of Thieves, who as we
may say liv'd under him, were always kept low and poor,
and could not subsist but by the Bounty of their Gover-
nour; and when they had a Booty of any Bulk, or Value,
they knew not what to do with it, but to deposite it, and
get some Money for the present Use, and then have a lit-
tle more upon its being disposed the right way.
For the managing this Part, he had his particular Ser-
vants to take and receive, so that Jonathan receiv'd no-
thing, deliver'd nothing, nor could any thing be fasten'd
on him to his hurt, I mean for receiving stolen Goods, and
yet as things stood, almost all the stolen Goods were
brought to him, and put into his Hands.
He openly kept his Compting House, or Office, like a
Man of Business, and had his Books to enter every thing
in with the utmost Exactness and Regularity: When you
first came to him to give him an Account of any thing
Lost, it was hinted to you, That you must first deposite a
Crown, this was his Retaining Fee; Then you were ask'd
some needful Questions, that is to say needful, not for his
Information, but for your Amusement; as where you
liv'd, where the Goods were Lost, whether out of your
House, or out of your Pocket, or whether on the High-
way, and the like; and your Answers to them all were
Minuted down, as if in order to make a proper Search and
Inquiry;whereas perhaps the very Thing you came to en-
quire after, was in the very Room where you were, or not
far off: After all this Grimace was at an end, you were de-
sir'd to call again, or send in a day or two, and then you
should know whether he was able to do you any Service
or no, and so you were dismiss'd.
At your second coming, you had some Encourage-
ment given you, that you would be serv'd, but perhaps
the Terms were a little rais'd upon you, and you were told
the Rogue that had it was Impudent, that he insisted it
was worth so much, and he could sell it when he would
for double the Money you offer'd; and that if you would
not give him such a Sum, he would not treat with you;
however, says Jonathan, if I can but come to the Speech
of him, I'll make him be more reasonable.
The next time he tells you, that all he can bring the
Rogue to is, that Guineas being paid to the Porter
who shall bring the Goods, and a Promise upon Honour
that nothing shall be said to him, but just take and give;
the gold Watch, or the Snuff-Box, or whatever it is, shall
be brought to you by such a time exactly; and thus upon
mutual Assurances the Bargain is made for restoring the
Goods.
But then it remains to be ask'd, what Mr. Wild ex-
pects for his Pains in managing this nice Part, who an-
swers with an air of Greatness, he leaves it to you; that he
gets nothing by what is to be given the Porter, that he is
satisfyed in being able to serve Gentlemen in such a Man-
ner, so that it is in your Breast to do what you think is
handsome by Mr. Wild, who has taken a great deal of
Pains in it to do you a Service.
It must be confess'd that in all this, if there was no
more than is mention'd, such a Part might be Acted on
all Sides without any Guilt fasten'd any where but on the
Thief: For Example,a House is robb'd,or a Lady has lost
her Gold Watch: Jonathan by his Intelligence among the
Gang, finds out who has done it; that is to say, he is told
'tis such a one; 'tis no matter how he hears it, he is not
bound to the Discovery upon a hear-say; nor is he oblig'd
to prosecute a Felony committed on he does not know
who, by he knows not who, that's none of his Business.
However, having a kind of Knowledge of the Person,
he sends to him, to let him know, that if he is his own
Friend, he will carry, that is, sendthe Watch,or the Cane,
or the Snuff-box, so, and so, to such a Place; and that if he
does so, and the Porter receives ten Guineas, or more, or
less, whatever it is that is offered, all will be well; if not,
he adds a Threatning, that he will be prosecuted with the
utmost Severity.
Upon this, the Thief sends the Goods,has the Money,
and never sees Jonathan, nor any Person else: What can
Jonathan be charg'd with, in such an Affair as this? I must
confess I do not see it; no, nor if the Thief sends him a
present of four or five Guineas out of the Money, provid-
ed as he said it is without any Conditions made before-
hand, or being present, at the Time 'tis done.
vol. 11 s
Nor, on the other hand, does the treating for deliver-
ing the Goods, as above, with a second or third Person
give any Room to fix any Thing on Jonathan: So that, in
short, he treats both with the Thief and with the Person
robb'd, with the utmost safety and security. Indeed I do
not see why he might not have carryed on such a Com-
merce as this, with the greatest Ease, I do not say Hon-
esty, in the World, if he had gone no farther; for he took
none of your Money for restoring your Goods neither did
he restore you any Goods; you gave him Money indeed
for his Trouble in enquiring out the Thief, and for using
his Interest by awing or perswading to get your stolen
Goods sent you back, telling you what you must give to
the Porter that brings them, if you please, for he does not
oblige you to give it.
But the Danger lay on the other side of the Question,
namely,not being contented with what thePerson robb'd
gave upon the Foot of a grateful Acknowledgement, for
trouble; but impudently taking the Goods of the Thief,
sending the Porter himself, taking the Money, and then
capitulating with theThief,for such aPart of the Reward;
and then this Thief coming in against him as a Witness.
This was the very Case in the Fact upon which Jonathan
miscarried.
So that in a Word, Jonathan's Avarice hang'd him. It
is true, in the Case he was try'd for, it was Apparent that
he set the Robbery, as they express it; that is, he directed
the Persons to the Place, nay, went with them to show
them the Shop, described the Woman and the Business;
and after all, receiv'd the Goods, and gave them the Mo-
ney for returning them, reserving it in his own Power to
take what more he pleas'd for himself; and at last all this
being testifyed by the Thieves themselves.
It is not to be doubted, but Jonathan, to carry on this
Commerce to such a Highth as he really had rais'd it, had
a perfect Understanding with all the profess'd Thieves
in the Town; at least the young Beginners, for these are a
Class generally more out of his Power than others, and
who are not so easily to be governed as the others are; and
yet he finds ways to Influence them too in the way of their
Practice. But the rest, I say, he had in his Reach mahag'd
them as he thought fit; nay, he generally knew, or perhaps
appointed them the Quarter they should walk in; so that
when ever any Person came to Enquire for his Goods lost,
he could make a tollerable Guess at the Thief, by the part
of the Town you liv'd in, or where you were when you
lost it.
I remember I had occasion, in a Case of this Kind, to
wait upon Mr. Jonathan with a Crown in my Hand, as a-
bove, and having made a Deposite, I was ask'd, as above,
where the Thing was lost ? At first he smil'd, and turning
to one, I suppose of his Instruments, who can this be?
says he, why all our People are gone down to Sturbridge
Fair; the other answer'd, after some pause, I think I saw
Lynx, in the Street, Yesterday: Did you, says he, then 'tis
that Dog, I warrant you. Well, Sir, says he, I believe we
can find out your Man; you shall know more of it, if you
let me see you again a Monday, this was on the Friday:
When the Monday came, truly I was told, they could not
see the young Rogue, and they believ'd he was gone after
the rest to the Fair, it being about the beginning of Sep-
tember.
After the Fair, I came again and again, but was put
off from time to time, and could not at last be serv'd in the
Case, it being only a Silver-hilted Sword, which the
Thief it seems had found means to turn into Money,
2 6o
Life and Actions
and then there was no coming at it; the Time also hav-
ing been laps'd by his Honour, having been gone to the
Fair.
Another Person applying in another and more ma-
terial Affair, was treated with Respect by Mr. Wild, and
a Pot of Tea brought out in Form: (N.B. The Crown be-
ing firsl: deposited as usual) The Case related to a Gold
Watch, with Trinkits and some Diamonds about the
Watch, and the Lady offer'd very considerably, for the
restoring it, as I remember, 30/. but no Advertise-
ments had been publish'd. Mr. Wild, after the usual En-
quiries of when it was losl:? and where? And being told it
was at St. Anne's Church, Weslminsler, pauses a while,
and calls up a Servant, and asks aloud, where was M- - -11
K lalt Sunday? About WeffminSIer, says the Man,
but the Bi - -h would not tell where. Was she Crank? says
Mr. Wild. I don't know, says the Fellow. However, turn-
ing to the Lady, says he, Madam, I fancy I shall be able
to serve you, and perhaps for less money than your lady-
ship speaks of. If it be M UK g} that Woman, I
have in my Thoughts, as I believe 'tis, for she is a dex-
trous Jade at the Work, I'll have her safe before Morn-
ing. The Lady full of Compassion returns, O sir! don't
take her up; I assure you I won't prosecute, I'll rather
lose my Watch, than have any poor Wretch Hang'd for it.
Why? Madam, says Mr. Wild, Wecan'ttalkwithher,
but by Threatning: We musT: not make a Bargain with
her, that would be to compound a Felony. If I can per-
swade her to come and bring your Watch, and ask your
Pardon, will that satisfy you. Nay, says the Lady, I don't
know whether that would be safe,neither: If she will send
it me, I had rather; and I'll forgive her, without asking
Pardon. Well, Madam, will you take it, and give the
Porter that brings it 20 Guineas, if you please, but not to
oblige you to it. Whatever you say, Mi. Wild, says the
Lady. Well, Madam, says Mr. Wild, if I may have the
Honour to see your Ladyship again.
Lady. Will it not do if I send any Body?
Wild. Why, truly, no Madam: People that deal in
these Things, do not care for Witnesses.
Lady. Well, well, that's true: I'll come my self. What
Day would you have me come?
Wild. On Thursday, Madam.
Lady. Well, Mr. Wild, what must I do? What will
satisfy you for your Trouble?
Wild. It is time enough, Madam, to speak of thatwhen
I am sure I can do you any Service. These Creatures are
very loose, and I can't tell you how it may be.
[Lady.] Well,Mr. Wild, I'll come furnish'dto pay my
Respects to you
Wild. Madam, Your most obedient Servant.
[Waits on her to her coach.]
Accordingly, Thursday coming, the Lady appears.
Mr. Wild, in his Callimancoe Night-gown, (the same he
was hang'd in) receives her; and with a pleasant Look,
tells her, he is very glad, to be able to say, that he believes
he shall serve her. That it was the same Woman he sus-
pected, and that the Jade had already pawn'd the Watch
for some Money, but that it was but a little, and he was
glad she had.
Lady. Why, Mr. Wild.?
Wild. Because, Madam; if she had kept it all this
while, it would have been ten to one but she had Broke
something about it, or done it some Mischief.
Lady. That's true, indeed. Pray what has she Pawn'd
it for?
Wild. Not much, Madam, she has got but seven
Guineas upon it yet.
Lady. Well, Mr. Wild, what musl be done?
Wild. Why, Madam, If the People, that have it, bring
it safe and sound to your Ladyship, will you give me your
Honour that you will ask no Questions, or Hop the Per-
son that comes with it?
Lady. I promise you, on my Word, I will not.
Wild. The Man that brings it may be a poor Innocent
Fellow, that knows nothing of it.
Lady. Well, well, he shall have no Harm or Interrup-
tion from me.
Wild. Then I believe your Ladyship may hear some-
thing of it to Night.
Lady. And what must I give him?
Wild. I don't yet know, Madam, but I'll bring them
aslowas I can.Notabove2oGuineas,to besure,Madam.
Lady. That is very kind, indeed. Well, Mr. Wild, then
I'll make it up to you. [So the Lady Pulls out her Purse in
order to give him some Money."]
Wild. No, Madam, not a Farthing. Besides you have
not got your Watch yet: Pray slay till you see whether
the Jade will Perform; tho' I think, indeed, I am pretty
sure of her.
Lady. Well, I'll take your Word, Mr. Wild. [Offers
him Money again.]
Wild. By no Means, Madam; let me see if I can serve
you.
Lady. Well, Mr. Wild, if it musl: be so, I must come
again then.
Wild. It may be not. Will your Ladyship be pleas'd to
slay about half an Hour?
Lady. Ay, with all my Heart.
In about half an Hour, Jonathan having been call'd
hastily out, comes in again immediately. Madam, says
he, if your Ladyship pleases to go into your Coach, and
drive gently up Street, perhaps a Messenger may
desire to speak with you as you go along.
Very well, Mr. Wild, I understand you.
Upon the Lady's going along Street, a Ticket-
Porter, with his Hat in his Hand, shows himself by the
Coach-side, and the Lady taking the Hint, stops her
Coach, and lets down the Glass, and speaking totheFel-
low, says, Would you speak with me Friend?
The Fellow says not a Word, but delivers into her
Hand the Watch with all the Trinkits and Dimonds per-
fectly safe; and when she had look'd upon it a little, gives
her a Note, wherein was written nothing but thus in
Words at length,
Eighteen Guineas.
The Lady immediately tells out the Money to the
Porter, and he was going away: Hold! Honest Friend,
says the Lady, there's somewhat for your self; and gives
him half a Guinea, and so dismiss'd him.
A Day or two after she makes Mr. Wild a Visit, and
presents him with 15 Guineas more: But with greatDiffi-
culty made him accept of it; telling her it was a great deal
to much; that he would not take it by any means, but at
last accepts it, with the Ceremony of saying, he wouldnot
take it on account of the Watch, but for having been at
some Trouble in serving her Ladyship, in which she was
pleas'd to Reward him much more than he deserv'd;
when, at the same time 'twas very likely [he] had part of
the i8 Guineas too from M— UK—g, who he frighted
out of the Watch with threatning to have her put into
Newgate for stealing of it.
This may serve for a Sketch of Praftice, as I call it; and
to let the World see in what manner this Secret Service
was carryed on; how the Thieving Trade was managed,
how the People were gull'd out of their Money, and how
a Crew of Hell-born Rogues and Whores, which is much
the same, have been bred up to the Trade by their grand
Patron and Master of Art, Jonathan Wild. It would be
endless to give a particular of the many Tricks andCheats
of this Kind that he has manag'd, during a continued
Life of Wickedness, for about i6 Years, among which it
would be very Instructing, to give an accountof thenum-
bers of poor wretched Creatures, like himself; who he
having first led them on in the Road of Crime for several
Years, as long as they would be subservient to him, and
put all their Purchase into his Hands, abandon'd as soon
as they offer'd to set up for themselves, and leaving them
to the mercy of the Government,made himself the Instru-
ment of their Destruction, and then pleaded the Merit of
it to the Publick. But these require a long History, rather
than a Pamphlet, and therefore I wholly omit them.
It is time now to enter into a Particular Account of the
conclusion of this Life of Crime, it has been a kind of
Comedy, or a Farce rather all a long, but it prov'd a Tra-
gedy at last; and Jonathan being brought to Justice, has
summ'd up his Account here in a most ignominious End,
satisfyed how in a manner not uncommon only, but such
as History can not give one Instance of the like, except
lately, that of a Murther at St. Edmunds-Bury, in Suffolk.
The Sum of the matter is this, Jonathan had long been
- so Notorious, and his Practice, tho' not within the Com-
pass of the Law, was yet in its Nature so Criminal in it-
self, and above all, was so dangerous in its Example, that
the Publick began to be justly Alarm'd at it, and to con-
side of proper Measures for putting a stop to it, [for]
which purpose an Act of Parliament, (the only Remedy
for growing Evils of this kind) was pass'd the last Session
to make it Felony, to take or receive any Reward for the
restoring of any stolen Goods, knowing them to be
Stolen: The Clause in the said Act is as follows.
"And whereas there are several Persons who have se-
cret Acquaintance with Felons, and who make it their
Business to help Persons to their stol'n Goods, and by
that means gain Money from them, which is divided be-
tween them and the Felons, whereby they greatly encou-
rage such Offenders: Be it Enacted by the authority
aforesaid, That where ever any Person taketh Money or
Reward, directly or indiredtly, under pretence or upon
Account of helping any Person or Persons to any stol'n
Goods or Chattels, every such Person so taking Money
or Reward as aforesaid, (unless such Person do appre-
hend, or cause to be apprehended, such Felon who stole
the same, and cause such Felon to be brought to his Tryal
for the same, and give Evidence against him) shall be
Guilty of Felony, and suffer the Pains and Penalties of
Felony, according to the Nature of the Felony com-
mitted in stealing such Goods and Chattels, in the man-
ner and with such Circumstances as [if] the same were
stol'n."
This Act was so directly aim'd at Jonathan's general
Practice, that he could not be Ignorant enough not to see
266
L1fe and Act1ons
it; but least he should, a certain Honourable Person, too
just to favour him, and yet too human not to warn him of
his Danger that he might avoid it; gave him Notice that
this very Act was made against his unlawful Practice, and
therefore in time warn'd him, in few, but significant
Words, to take heed to himself and avoid the Conse-
quences by leaving off the Trade of Thief-Catching, as it
is unjustly call'd, that is, of compounding for the return
of stol'n Goods.
But good Advice to Jonathan Wild, was like talking
Gospel to akettle Drum, bidding a Dragoon not Plunder,
or talking of Compassion to a Hussar; he that was hard-
nedabovetheBasenessof all cautionary Fear, scorn'd the
Advice, and went on in his wicked Trade; not warily and
wisely as he had formerly done, but in short, with more
Impudence and shameless Boldness than evei, for as if he
despis'd Laws, and the Governours, and the provok'd
Justiceof the Nation: He now not only took Rewards for
returning Goods stolen, but even directed the Stealing of
them, and making himself a Party to the very Robberies
themselves; acted a Part of the Thief, and the Receiver
also; and this in so many Cases, that we are told if the In-
dictment had fail'd for which he was justly condemn'd,
there were several others ready to have been brought on,
and the Witnesses ready to have been produc'd for Proof
of the Facts.
But one Felony being fully prov'd was sufficient; and
upon a full Hearing he was Convicted in so evident a
Manner, that he really had nothing to say in his own Be-
half, not being able to deny the Fact; his Council would
have pleaded, that the Offence was not within the late
Statute upon which he was Indicted; but the Court an-
swer'd them fully, and over-ruled the Plea; so that being
allow'd to be within the Statute, and the Fact being fully
proved by several Witnesses, he receiv'd Sentence of
Death the 15th of May last.
The Circumstances of this Fact seem to be so agree-
able to the whole tenor of Jonathan's former Practice, and
so like other Parts of his Life, that we can not but observe
the Paralel,and conclude the particular Accountsof other
parts of his Life to be true likewise.
It has been said of him, that if ever he was mov'd to
promote any Man, or to help any Man to Business, which
he often pretended to do in Compassion to their Poverty,
that still he did it always in his own way, that is to say, en-
deavour'd to make Thieves of them, to bring them to be
Hang'd, to keep them from Misery, and to make New-
gate Birds of them, to keep them outof the Compters; this
he practis'd principally upon young Creatures, and little
destitute Children, such as seem'd to be left to wander
about in Want and Beggery; and many a poor Boy he has
pick'd up in the Street pretending Charity, andawilling-
ness to do them good, which when it has come to the
Issue,hasbeennomoreorless than to breed them up to
Thieving, and ripen them for the Devil.
But which is still worse than all the rest, I have several
Stories by me at this Time, which I have particular Rea-
sons to believe are true, of Children thus strolling about
the Streets in Misery and Poverty, whom he has taken in
on pretence of providing for them, and employing them;
and all has ended in this (viz.) making Rogues of them.
Horrid Wickedness! his Charity has been to breed them
up to be Thieves, and slill more horrid'! several of these
his own jorsler Children, he has himself caused afterwards
Life and Actions
to be apprehended and Hang'd for the very Crimes
which he first taught them how to Commit.
I am not indeed to make a jest of these things, there is
something shocking and dismal in the very Relation, and
therefore it is, that this Account of the Life of Jonathan
Wild, which in its Nature, is all a Tragedy, is not related
with an air of Banter and Ridicule as Others are; 'tis hop-
ed it will not be the less acceptable to Men of Sense; it is a
solemn and terrible thing to look back on a Life of such
harden'd, abominable Practices; to see it carried on in de-
fiance, either of God or Devil; and that with such Success
too, passing for so many Years unpunish'd; and tho*
there are some things in the long Series of his wickedLife,
which may relish with the Levity of a drol-way of Writ-
ing ; yet to see a Man turn'd into an incarnate Devil, his
Life a Sceneof inimitable Crimes; his very Society a Hell,
andequally devouring both to Soul and Body; he that can
read it without some Horror, must have very little of what
we call Christianity about him.
To see him take up an unthinking Youth in the Street
cover'd with Dirt and Rags, and willing on any Terms to
get out of his Misery; to see this superlative Wretch pre-
tend Charity to the Child, and tell him he will provide for
him, and thereby engage the Lad to him, as to a Gentle-
man thatintends to do him good; and then instead of pro-
viding for him, lead him by the Hand to Hell gates, and
after that, like a true Devil, thrust him in! First to tempt,
and then accuse, which is the very nature of the Devil;
firsttomake poor desolate vagabond Boys, Thieves, and
then betray them to the Gallows! Who can think of such
a thing without a just Abhorrence, who can think it to be
any less than the worst sort of Murther; such was the Life
and such the Practice of this wretched Man, and in these
very last Scenes of his Life, he grew so audacious, that it
seem'd as if he was really ripening up a pace for his own
Destruction.
It is said of him in the Case of that harden'd Felow
Blueskin, that he should say, Jonathan first made him a
Thief, and then abandoning him, left him to carry it on
by himself; and it being necessary to his (Jonathan's)
Fame to have always some Chase in his view, to build his
own Merit upon, with the Government; he kept a Watch
upon him, that he might at last bring him to the Gallows,
for which the said Blueskin was very near giving him a
pass into another World, by that desperate Attempt to
cut his Throat in the face of a Court of Justice; which
Jonathan tho' surpriz'd at then, has had leisure since to
wish, had been effectually done at that time, and said so
publickly in the Press-Yard, two days before his Tryal.
But to come then to the particular Fact for which he
Suffer'd, the Story asit was relatedupon Oath athis Tryal,
and the several Circumstances belonging to it stands thus,
Katherine Stetham deposed: That on the 2 2d, of Janu-
ary, between Three and Four in the Afternoon a Man
and Woman came into her Shop, under Pretence of buy-
ing some Lace: They were said she so very difficult, that
I had none below that would please them; and so, leav-
ing my Daughter in the Shop, I stepped up Stairs, and
brought down another Box. We could not agree abDut
the Price, and so they went away together; and in about
half an Hour after I miss'd a Tin Box of Lace, that I
valu'd at 50/. The same Night, and the next, I went to
Jonathan PFilde's House; but not meeting with him, I
advertised the Lace that I had lost, with a Reward of
i5 Guineas, and no Questions ask'd. But hearingnothing
of it, I wentto Jonathan's House again,and then met with
him: He desir'd me to give him a Description of the Per-
sons that I suspected, which I did as near as I could; and
then he told me that he'd make Enquiry, and bade me
call again in two or three days. I did so; and then he said,
that he had heard something of my Lace, and expected
to know more of the Matter in a little time. I came to him
againonthatday thathe was apprehended, (I think 'twas
the i5thofF<?£r##r)\)Itoldhim,thattho' I hadadvertised
but i5 Guineas Reward, yet I'd give 20 or 25 rather than
not have my Goods. Don't be in such a Hurry, says he, /
don't know but I may help you to it for less; and if Ican, I will.
The Persons that have it, are gone out of Town, I shall set
them to quarrelling about it, and then I shall get it the cheaper.
On the i oth of March, he sent me word, that if I would
come to him in Newgate, and bring i0 Guineas in my
Pocket, he could help me to the Lace. I went: He desired
me to call a Porter; but I not knowing where to find one,
he sent a Person who brought one that appeared to be a
Ticket-Porter. The Prisoner gave me a Letter, which he
said was sent him as a Direction where to go for the Lace;
but I could not read, and so I deliver'd it to the Porter.
Then he desired me to give the Porter the i o Guineas, or
else (he said) the Persons that had the Lace would not de-
liver it. I gave the Porter the Money; he went away, and
in a little time return'd, and brought me a Box that was
seal'd up, but not the same that was lost. I open'd it, and
found all my Lace but one Piece. Now, Mr. Wilde, (says
I) What musl you have for your Trouble? Not a farthing,
(says he) not a Farthing for me. I don't do these things for
worldly In teresl, but only for the Good of poor People that
have met with Misfortunes. As for the Piece of Lace that is
missing, I hope to getitforyou e'er long; and I don't know but
that I may help you not only to your Money again, but to the
Thief too; and if Ican, much good may'tdoyou. And as you're
a good Woman and a Widow, and a Chrislian, I desire no-
thing of you but your Prayers, andfor them I shall be thank-
ful. I have a great many Enemies, and God knows what may
be the Consequence of this Imprisonment.
This is a black Story indeed, and it was very remark-
able, that the Fact was really committed, that is to say,
the Felony was contracted, or that Part which the late
Act in particular reach'd, (viz.) the delivering the Goods,
and taking the Money for discovering them; all this Part
was acted I say after his being committed to Newgate.
It was likewise very remarkable, that there was anoth-
er Case much of the same Nature,which lay ready to have
been brought to a Hearing if this had not intervened,
namely; of a Pocket-Book stolen from Mr. Tidman a
Corn Chandler, in Giltspur slreet, near Newgate, in which
was a Bank Bill for ii61. in which the Witnesses were
two Persons who had pleaded to their Pardons.
We come now to his Behaviour after his Condemna-
tion, and at the Place of Execution, at which last Place he
indeed scarce said a Word to God or Man, being either
doz'd with the liquid Laudanum which he had taken, or
demented and confus'd by the horror of what was before
him, and the reflection of what was within him.
Nor even before he took the Dose of Laudanum was
he in any suitable manner sensible of his Condition, or
concern'd about it, very little sign appear'd of his having
the least Hope concerning his future State; but as he
liv'd harden'd, he seem'd to die stupid.
272 Li FE ActiON s
He declin'd coming to the Chapel, either to the Ser-
mon or Prayers, pleading his lameness by the Gout, but
chiefly the Crowds and Disorders of the People discom-
posing or disordering him. In the condemn'd Hold, or
Place where Malefactors are kept after their Sentence,
they had Prayers as usual, and he seem'd to join with
them in a kind of Form, but little or nothingof the Peni-
tence of a Criminal, in view of Death, appear'd upon
him.
His principal Enquiries seem'd to be about what kind
of State was to be expected after Death, and how the in-
visible World was to be discrib'd; but nothingof the most
certain Judgmentwhichisthere to be expected, righteous
and terrible, according to the Deeds done in the Body, or
of a Saviour to whom to have recourse, as the Slayer in the
old Law had to the City of Refuge to save him from the
avenger of Blood.
As his Time shortn'd he seem'd more and more con-
fus'd, and then began to entertain Discourses of theLaw-
fulnessof dismissing ourselves out of the present Misery,
after the Example of the antient Romans, which as he said
was then esteem'd as an act of Bravery and Gallantry, and
recorded to their Honour.
This kind of Discourse was indeed sufficient to have
caused the Keepers to have had an Eye to him, so as to
prevent any Violence he might offer to himself, and they
did watch him as narrowly as they could; however he so
far deceived them, as that the Day before his Execution
he found means to have a small Bottle with liquid Lau-
danum convey'd to him unseen, of which he took so large
a Quantity, that it was soon perceiv'd by the Change it
made upon him, for he was so drousie that he could not
hold up his Head, or keep open his Eyes, at the time of
reading the Prayers.
Upon this two of his Fellow Prisoners endeavour'd to
rouse him (not suspecting that he had taken enough to
hurt him) and taking him by the Hands, they perswaded
him to stand up, and walk a little about the Room, which
he could not do without help because of his Gout.
Th1s walking, tho' it did a little waken him, had several
other Operations at the same time; for first it chang'd his
Countenance, turning it to be exceeding pale, then it put
him into a violent Sweat, which made them apprehend he
would faint, upon which they offered to give him some-
thing to keep up his Spirits, but he refus'dit,tellingthem
he was very sick; soon after which he vomited very vio-
lently, and this in all probability prolong'd his Life for
the Execution; for by their stirring him, and making him
vomit, he brought up the greatest Part of the Laudanum
which he had taken, before it had been long enough in his
Stomach to mix with the animal Spirits or Blood, which if
it had done but one Hour more, he would certainly have
taken his last sleep in the Prison.
But Nature having thus discharg'd itself of the load,
he reviv'd again, and tho' still doz'd and insensible of
what he said or did, yet he was able to walk about, speak,
and act sufficiently for the Part that remain'd to him,
namely, for the last scene of his Life at the Gallows.
Accord1ngly on Mondaythe 24th of May, he was con-
vey'd in a Cart to Tyburn, and tho' it was apparent he was
stillunderthe Operationof theLaudanum,a.nd that which
was left in his Stomach had so far seiz'd upon his Spirits
as to make him almost stupid, yet it began to go off, and
Nature getting the Mastery of it, he began to be more
sensible of what he was going about; but the Scene was
then short, and he had little to do but to stand up in the
Cart, and, the needful Apparatus being made, be turn'd
off with the rest, which was done about 3 a-Clock in the
Afternooon.
The rudeness of the Mob to him, both at his first go-
ing into the Cart, and all the way from thence to the Place
of Execution, is not to be express'd, and shews how no-
torious his Life had been, and what Impression his known
Villanies had made on the Minds of the People; for, con-
trary to the general Behaviour of the Street in such Cases,
instead of compassionate Expressions,and a general Cast
of Pity which ordinarily sits on the Countenances of the
People, when they see the miserable Objects of Justice
go to their Execution; here was nothing to be heard but
Cursings and Execrations; abhorring the Crimes and the
very Name of the Man, throwing Stones and Dirt at him
all the way, and even at the Place of Execution; the other
Malefactors beingallreadyto be turn'd off, but the Hang-
man giving him leave to take his own Time, and he con-
tinuing setting down in the Cart,the Mob impatient, and
fearing a Reprieve, tho' they had no occasion for it, call'd
furiously upon the Hangman to dispatch him, and at last
threatened to tear him to pieces, if he did not tye him up
immediately.
In short there was a kind of an universal Rage against
him, which nothing but his Death could satisfie or put an
end to, and if a Reprieve had come, it would have, twas
thought, been difficult for the Officers to have brought
him back again without his receiving some Mischief, if
not his Deaths Wound from the Rabble.
So detestable had he made himself by his notorious
Crimes, and to such a height were his wicked Practices
come.
Thus ended the Tragedy,and thus was a Life of horrid
and inimitable Wickedness finish'd at the Gallows, the
very same Place where, according to some, above i20
miserable Creatures had been hang'd, whose Blood in
great measure may be said to lye at his Door, either in
their being first brought into the thieving Trade, or led
on in it by his Encouragement and Assistance; and many'
of them at lasT: betray'd and brought to Justice by his ^2-
Means; upon which worstsortof Murtherhevaluedhim-
self, and would have had it pass'd for ^Merit, even with
the Government itself. ^

COLONEL JACK
IW A S now at the Height of my good Fortune; indeed
I was in very good Circumstances, and being of a fru-
gal Temper from the Beginning, I sav'd Things to-
gether as they came, and yet liv'd very well too; particu-
larly I had the Reputation of a very considerable Mer-
chant, and one that came over vastly Rich from Virginia,
and as I frequently brought Supplies for my several Fa-
milies and Plantations there, as they wrote to me for them
so I pass'd (I say) for a great Merchant.
I liv'd single indeed, and in Lodgings, but I began to
be very well known, and tho' I had subscrib'd my Name
only Jack to my particular Correspondent,yet the French,
among whom I liv'd near a Year, (as I have said) not un-
derstanding what 7^ meant, call'd me Monsieur Jacque,
and Colonel Jacques, and so gradually Colonel Jacque; so
I was call'd in the Certificate of exchanging me with the
other Prisoner, so that I went so also into Flanders; upon
which, and seeing my Certificate of Exchange, (as above)
I was call'd Colonel Jaques in England,by my Friend,who
I call'd Correspondent; and thus I pass'd for a Foreigner,
and a Frenchman, and I was infinitely fond of havingevery
Body take me for a Frenchman; and as I spoke French very
well, having learn'd it by continuing so long among them:
so I went constantly to the French-Church in London, and
spoke French upon all Occasions, as much as I could, and
VOl. ii b
to compleat the Appearance of it, I got me a French Ser-
vant to do my Business, I mean as to my Merchandise,
which only consisted in receiving and disposingof Tobacco
of which I had about 500 to 600 Hogsheads a Year from
my own Plantations, and in supplying my People with
Necessaries, as they wanted them.
In this private Condition I continued about two Year
more, when the Devil owing me a Spleen, ever since I re-
fus'd being a Thief, paid me Home, with my Interest, by
laying a Snare in my Way, which had almost ruined me.
There dwelt a Lady, in the House opposite to the
House I lodg'd in, who made an extraordinary Figure, in
deed she went very well dress'd, and was a most beautiful
Person; she was well bred,sung admirably fine,and some-
times I could hear her very distinctly, the Houses being
over-against one another, in a narrow Court, not much
unlike Three-King-Court in Lombard-Street.
This Lady put herself so often in my Way, that I could
not in good Manners forbear taking Notice of her, and
giving her the Ceremony of my Hat, when I saw her at the
Window, or at the Door, or when I pass'd her in the
Court, so that we became almost acquainted at a Distance;
sometimes she also visited at the House I lodg'd at, and it
was generally contriv'd,that I should be introduced when
she came; and thus by Degrees we became more intimate-
ly acquainted,and often convers'd together in the Family,
but always in Publick, at least for a great while.
I was a meer Boy in the Affair of Love, and knew the
least of what belong'd to a Woman, of any Man in Europe
of my Age; the Thoughts of a Wife, much less of a Mis-
tress, had never so much as taken the least hold of my
Head, and I had been till now as perfectly unacquainted
with the Sex, and as unconcern'd about them, as I was
when I was ten Year old, and lay in a Heap of Ashes at a
Glass-House.
But I know not by what Witchcraft, in the Conversa-
tion of this Woman, and her singling me out upon several
Occasions, I began to be ensnared, I knew not how, or to
what End; and was on a sudden so embarrass'd in my
Thoughts about her, that like a Charm she had me always
in her Circle; if she had not been one of the subtilest Wo-
men on Earth, she could never have brought me to have
given myself the least Trouble about her; but I, drawn in
by the Magick of a Genius,capable to deceive a more wary
Capacity than mine, and it was impossible to resist her.
She attack'd me without ceasing, with the Fineness of
her Conduct, and with Arts, which were impossible to be
ineffectual; she was ever (as it were) in my View, often in
my Company, and yet kept herself so on the Reserve, so
surrounded continuallywithObstructions,that for several
Months after she could perceive I sought an Opportunity
to speak to her, she rendered it impossible, nor could I
ever break in upon her, she kept her Guard so well.
Th1s rigid Behaviour was the greatest Mystery that
could be, considering at the same Time, that she never
declined my seeing her,or conversing with me in Publick;
but she held it on, she took Care never to sit next me, that
I might slip no Paper into her Hand, or speak softly to
her; she kept some Body or other always between, that I
could never come up to her; and thus, as if she was resolv'd
really to have nothing to do with me, she held me at the
Bay several Months.
All this while nothing was more certain than that she
intended to have me, if she could catch, and it was indeed
a kind of a Catch, for she manag'd all by Art,and drew me
in with the most resolute Backwardness, that it was almost
impossible not to be deceiv'd by it; on the other Hand,
she did not appear to be a Woman despicable, neither was
she poor, or in a Condition that should require so much
Art to draw any Man in; but the Cheat was really on my
Side; for she was unhappily told, that I was vastly Rich, a
great Merchant, and that she would live like a Queen,
which I was not at all instrumental in putting upon her,
neither did I know that she went upon that Motive.
She was too cunning to let me perceive how easy she
was to be had; on the contrary, she run all the Hazards of
bringing me to neglect her entirely, that one would think
any Woman in the World could do; and I have wondered
often since, that how it was possible it should fail of mak-
ing me perfectly averse to her; for as I had a perfect In-
differency for the whole Sex, and never, till then, enter-
tained any Notion of them, they were no more to me than
a Picture hanging up against a Wall.
As we convers'd freely together in Publick, so she took
a great many Occasions to rally the Men, and the Weak-
ness they were guilty of, in letting the Women insult
them as they did; she thought if the Men had been Fools,
Marriage had been only Treaties of Peace between two
Neighbours, or Alliances offensive or defensive, which
must necessarily have been carried on sometimes by In-
terviews, and personal Treaties; but oftner by Ambassa-
dors, Agents, and Emissaries on both Sides; but that the
Women had outwitted us, and brought us upon our
Knees, and made us whine after them, and lower our-
selves, so as we could never pretend to gain our Equality
again.
I told her I thought it was a Decency to the Ladies, to
give them the Advantage of denying a little, that they
might be courted, and that I should not like a Woman the
worse for denying me. I expect it Madam, says I, when I
wait on you To-morrow, intimating, that I intended it;
you shan't be deceiv'd Sir, says she, for I'll deny now, be-
fore you ask me the Question.
I was dash'd so effectually, with so malicious, so devil-
ish an Answer, that I return'd with a little Sullenness; I
shan't Trespass upon you yet Madam, and I shall be very
careful not to offend you when I do.
It is the greatest Token of your Respect Sir, says she,
that you are able to bestow upon me, and the most agree-
able too, except one, which I will not be out of Hopes of
obtaining of you in a little Time.
What is in my Power to oblige you in Madam, said I,
you may command me in at any Time, especially the Way
we are talking of; this I spoke still with a Resentment
very sincere.
'Tis only, Sir, that you would promise to hate me with
as much Sincerity, as I will endeavour to make you a suit-
able Return.
I granted that Request, Madam, seven Year before
you ask'd it, said I, for I heartily hated the whole Sex, and
scarce know how I came to abate that good Disposition in
Compliment to your Conversation; but I assure you that
Abatement is so little, that it does no Injury to your Pro-
posal.
There's some Mystery in that indeed, Sir, said she, for
I desir'd to assist your Aversion to Women in a more par-
ticular Manner,andhop'd it should never abate undermy
Management. We said a Thousand ill-natured Things
after this, but she out-did me, for she had such a Stock of
Bitterness upon her Tongue, as no Woman ever went be-
yond her, and yet all this while she was the pleasantest,
and most obliging Creature in every Part of our Conver-
sation that could possibly be, and meant not one Word of
what she said, no, not a Word: But I must confess, it no
way answer'd her End; for it really cooled all my Thoughts
of her, and I, that had liv'd in so perfect an Indifferency to
the Sex all my Days, was easily return'd to that Condition
again, and began to grow very cold and negligent in my
usual Respects to her upon all Occasions.
She soon found she had gone too far with me; and in
short, that shewas extreamly out in her Politicks, that she
had to do with one that was not lifted yet among the
whining Sort of Lovers, and knew not what it was to adore
a Mistress, in order to abuse her; and that it was not with
me, as it was with the usual Sort of Men in Love, that are
warm'd by the Cold, and rise in their Passions, as the La-
dies fall in their Returns; on the contrary, she found that
it was quite alter'd; I was civil to her, as before, but not so
forward, when I saw her at her Chamber Window, I did
not throw mine open, as I usually had done, to talk with
her; when she sung in the Parlour, where I could easily
hear it, I did not listen; when she visited at the House
where I lodg'd, I did not always come down, or if I did, I
had Business which oblig'd me to go Abroad, and yet all
this while, when I did come into her Company, I was as
intimate as ever.
I could easily see that this madded her to the Heart,
and that she was perplex'd to the last Degree, for she
found that she had all her Game to play over again; that so
absolute a Reservedness, even to Rudeness and ill Man-
ners, was a little too much; but she was a meer Posture
Mispress in Love, and could put herself into what Shapes
she pleas'd.
She was too wise to shewa Fondness or Forwardness,
that look'd like Kindness, she knew that was the meanest,
and last Step a Woman can take, and lays her under the
Foot of the Man she pretends to; Fondness is not the last
Favour indeed, but it is the last Favour but one, that a
Woman can grant, and lays her almost as low, I mean i t
lays her at the Mercy of the Man she shews it to, but she
was not come to that neither: This Camelion put on an -
other Colour, turn'd on a sudden the gravest, soberest,
majestick Madam, so that any one would have thought
she was advanced in Age in one Week, from Two and
Twenty to Fifty, and this she carried on with so much
Government of herself, that it did not in the least looklike
Art; but if it was a Representation of Nature only, it was
so like Nature itself, that no Body living can be able to dis-
tinguish; she sung very often in her Parlour, as well by
herself as with two young Ladies, who came often to see
her; I could see by their Books, and her Guitar in her
Hand, that she was singing, but she never open'd the
Window, she kept her own always shut, or if it was open,
she would be sitting at Work, and not look up, it may be,
once in half an Hour.
If she saw me by Accident all this while, she would
smile, and speak as chearfully as ever, but it was but a
Word or two, and so make her Honours and be gone; so
that in a Word, we convers'd just as we did, after I had
been there a Week.
She tired me quite out at this Work, for tho' I began
the Strangeness indeed, yet I did not design the carrying
it on so far; but she held it to the last, just in the same
Manner as she began it: She came to the House where I
lodg'd as usual, and we were often together, supp'd to-
gether, play'd Cards together, danc'd together; for in
France I accomplish'd myself with every Thing that was
needful, to make me what I believ'd myself to be even
from a Boy, I mean a Gentleman; I say, we convers'd to-
gether, as above, but she was so perfectly another Thing
than what she us'd to be in every Part of her Conversation,
that it presently occurr'd to me, that her former Behaviour
was a kind of a Rant, or Fit; that either it was the Effect
of some extraordinary Levity that had come upon her, or
that it was done to mimick the Coquets of the Town, be-
lieving it might take with me, who she thought was a
Frenchman, and that it was what I lov'd; but her new Gra-
vity was her real natural Temper, and indeed became it
her so much better, or as I should say, she acted it so well,
that it really brought me back to have, not as much only,
but more Mind to her than ever I had before.
However, it was a great while before I discover'd my-
self, and I staid indeed to find out, if possible, whether
this Change was real or counterfeit; for I could not easily
believe it was possible the gay Humour she us'd to appear
in could be a Counterfeit; it was not therefore till a Year
and almost a Quarter, that I came to any Resolution in my
Thoughts about her, when on a meer Accident we came
to a little Conversation together.
She came to visit at our House as usual, and ithappen'd
all the Ladies were gone Abroad; but as it fell out, I was
in the Passage, or Entry of the House, going towards the
Stairs, when she knock'd at the Door; so stepping back, I
open'd the Door, and she, without any Ceremony, came
in, and run forward into the Parlour, supposing the Wo-
men had been there, I went in after her, as I could do no
less, because she did know that the Family was Abroad.
Upon my coming in, she ask'd for the Ladies, I told
her, I hop'd she came to visit me now, for that the Ladies
were all gone Abroad: Are they (said she) as if surpriz'd
(tho' as I understood afterwards she knew it before, as also
that I was at Home) and then rises up to be gone: No Ma-
dam, said I, pray do not go; when Ladies come to visit me
I do not use to tire them of my Company so soon; that's as
ill-natured, says she, as you could possibly talk, pray don't
pretend I came to visit you, I am satisfy'd who I came to
visit, and satisfy'd that you know it; yes Madam, said I,
but if I happen to be all of the Family that's left at Home,
then you came to visit me.
I never receive Visits from those that I hate, says she.
You have me there indeed, said I, but you never gave
me Leave to tell you, why I hated you, I hated you because
you would never give me an Opportunity to tell you I
lov'd you; sure, you took me for some frightful Creature
that you would never come near enough, so much as to
whisper to you that I love you.
I never care to hear any Thing so disagreeable, says
she, tho' it be spoken ever so softly.
We rallied thus for an Hour; in short, she shewed the
Abundance of her Wit, and I an abundant Deficiency of
mine; for tho' three or four Times she provok'd me to the
last Degree, so that once I was going to tell her I had
enough of her Company, and if she pleas'd I would wait
upon her to the Door; yet she had always so much Witch-
craft on her Tongue, that she brought herself off again;
till, to make the Story short, we came at last to talk seri-
ously on both Sides about Matrimony, and she heard me
freely propose it, and answered me directly upon many
Occasions: For Example, she told me, I would carry her
away to France, or to Virginia, and that she could not
think of leaving England, her native Country; I told her,
I hop'd she did not take me for a Kidnapper: By the way,
I did not tell her how I had been Kidnapp'd myself: She
said no, but the Consequence of my Affairs, which were
it seems mostly Abroad, might oblige me to go, and she
could never think of marrying any Man, that she could
not be content to go all over the World with, if he had oc-
casion to go himself. This was handsomely expressed in-
deed, I made her easy in that Point, and thus we began
the grand Parley, which indeed she drew me into with the
utmost Art and Subtilty, such as was peculiar to herself,
but was infinitely her Advantage in our treating of Mar-
riage; for she made me effectually court her, tho' at the
same Time in her Design she courted me with the utmost
Skill, and such Skill it was, that her Design was perfectly
impenetrable to the last Moment.
In short, we came nearer and nearer every Time we
met, and after one casual Visit more, in which I had the
mighty Favour of talking with her alone; I then waited
on her every Day at her own House, or Lodgings rather,
and so we set about the Work to a Purpose, and in about
a Month we gave the World the slip, and were privately
marry'd to avoid Ceremony, and the publick Inconveni-
ency of a Wedding.
We soon found a House proper for our Dwelling, and
so went to House-keeping; we had not been long together,
but I found that gay Temper of my Wife return'd, and
she threw off the Mask of her Gravity, and good Con-
duct, that I had so long fancy'd was her meer natural Dis-
position, and now having no more occasion for Disguises,
she resolv'd to seem nothing but what really she was, a
wild untam'd Colt, perfectly loose, and careless to con-
ceal any Part, no, not the worst of her Conduct.
She carry'd on this Air of Levity to such an Excess,
that I could not but be dissatisfy'd at the Expence of it,
for she kept Company that I did not like, liv'd beyond
what I could support, and sometimes lost at Play more
that I car'd to pay: Upon which, one Day, I took Occa-
sion to mention it, but lightly; and said to her, by way of
Raillery, that we liv'd merrily, for as long as it would last;
she turn'd short upon me, what do ye mean, says she,
why, you don't pretend to be uneasy, do ye? No, no, Ma-
dam, not I, by no Means, 'tis no Business of mine you
know, said I, to enquire what my Wife spends, or whe-
ther she spends more than I can afford, or less, I only de-
sire the Favour to know, as near as you can guess, how
long you will please to take to dispatch me, for I would
not be too long a dying.
I don't know what you talk of, says she, you may die
as leisurely, or as hastily as you please, when your Time
comes, I an't a going to kill you, as I know of.
But you are a going to starve me Madam, said he,
and Hunger is as leisurely a Death, as breaking upon
the Wheel.
I starve you, why are not you a great Virginia Mer-
chant, and did not I bring you i500 /. What would you
have? Sure, you can maintain a Wife out of that, can't
you?
Yes, Madam, says I, I could maintain a Wife, but not
a Gamester, tho' you had brought me i500 /. a Year, no
Estate is big enough for a Box and Dice.
She took Fire at that, and flew out in a Passion, and
after a great many bitter Words, told me in short, that
she saw no Occasion to alter her Conduct; and as for my
not maintaining her, when I could not maintain her long-
er, she would find some Way or other to maintain herself.
Sometime after the first Rattle of this Kind, she vouch-
safed to let me know that she was pleas'd to be with Child;
I was at first glad of it, in hopes it would help to abate her
Madness; but it was all one, and her being wtih Child,
only added to the rest, for she made such Preparations
for her Lying-inn, and the other Appendixes of a Child's
being born, that in short, I found she would be down-
right distracted; and I took the Liberty to tell her one
Day, that she would soon bring herself and me to De-
struction, and entreated her to consider that such Figures
as those were quite above us, and out of our Circle; and in
short, that I neither could, nor would allow such Ex-
pences, that at this Rate, two or three Children would ef-
fectually Ruin me, and that I desir'd her to consider what
she was doing.
She told me with an Air of Disdain, that it was none of
her Business to consider any Thing of that Matter, that
if I could not allow it, she would allow it herself, and I
might do my worst.
I begg'd her to consider Things for all that, and not
drive me to Extremities, that I married her to love and
cherish her, and use her as a good Wife ought to be us'd,
but not to be ruin'd, and undone by her. In a Word, no-
thing could molify her, nor any Argument persuade her
to Moderation, but withal took it so heinously, that I
should pretend to restrain her, that she told me in so many
Words, she would drop her Burthen with me, and then if
I did not like it, she would take Care of herself, she would
not live with me an Hour; for she would not be restrain'd,
not she, and talk'd a long while at that Rate.
I told her, as to her Child, which she call'd her Bur-
then, it should be no Burthen to me, as to the rest she
might do as she pleas'd; it might however do me this Fa-
vour, that I should have no more Lyings-Inn at the Rate
of 136 /. at a Time, as I found she intended it should be
now; she told me she could not tell that, if she had no .
more by me, she hop'd she should by some Body else; say
you so Madam, said I, then they that get them, shall keep
them: She did not know that neither, she said, and so
turn'd it off Jearing, and as it were Laughing at me.
Th1s last Discourse nettled me, I must confess, and the
more, because had a great deal of it, and very often, till in
short, we began at length to enter into a friendly Treaty
about parting.
Nothing cou'd be more Criminal than the several Dis-
courses we had upon this Subject; she demanded a separ-
ate Maintenance, and in particular at the Rate of 300 /. a
Year, and I demanded Security of her, that she should
not run me in Debt; she demanded the keeping of the
Child, with an Allowance of 100 /. a Year for that, and I
demanding that I should be secur'd from being charg'd
for keeping any she might have by some Boby else, as she
had threaten'd me.
In the Interval, and during these Contests, she drop'd
her Burthen, (as she call'd it) and brought me a Son, a
very fine Child.
She was content, during her Lying-Inn, to abate a lit-
tle, tho' it was but a very little indeed, of the great Ex-
pence she had intended ; and with some Difficulty and
Persuasion was content with a Suit of Child-bed Linnen
of 15/. instead of one she had intended of Threescore;
and this she magnified as a particular Testimony of her
Condescension, and a yielding to my avaricious Temper,
as she call'd it.
But after she was up again, it was the same Thing, and
she went on with her Humour to that Degree, that in a
little Time she began to carry it on to other Excesses, and
to have a sort of Fellows come to visit her, which I did not
like, and once in particular, staid Abroad all Night: The
next Day when she came Home, she began to cry out
first; told me where (as she said) she lay, and that the Oc-
casion was a Christening, where the Company had a
Feast, and staid too late; that if I was dissatisfied, I might
inform myself there of all the Particulars, where she lay,
and the like; I told her coldly, Madam, you do well to sug-
gest my being dissatisfied, for you may be sure I am, and
you cou'd expect no other; that as to going to your
Haunts to inform myself, that's not my Business; 'tis
your Business to bring Testimonies of your Behaviour,
and to prove where you lay, and in what Company, 'tis
enough to me that you lay out of your own House, with-
out your Husband's Knowledge or Consent, and before
you and I converse again, I must have some Satisfaction
of the Particulars.
She answer'd,with all her Heart, she was as indifferent
as I, and since I took so ill her lying at a Friend's House
on an extraordinary Occasion, she gave me to under-
stand, that it was what she would have me expect, and
what she would have the Liberty to do when she thought
fit.
Well Madam, said I, if I must expect what I cannot
allow, you must expect I shall shut my Doors by Day,
against those that keep out of them at Night.
She would try me, she said, very speedily, and if I shut
the Doors against her, she would find a Way to make me
open them.
Well Madam, says I, you threaten me hard, but I
would advise you to consider before you take such Mea-
sures, for I shall be as good as my Word: However, it was
not long that we cou'd live together upon these Terms;
for I found very quickly what Company she kept, and
that she took a Course which I ought not to bear; so I be-
gan the Separation first, and refused her my Bed: We had
indeed refrain'd all Converse as Husband and Wife for
about two Months before, for I told her very plainly, I
would Father no Brats that were not of my own getting;
and Matters coming thus gradually to an Extremity, too
great to continue as it was, she went off one Afternoon,
and left me a Line in Writing, signifying that Affairs
were come to such a Pass between us, that she did not
think fit to give me the Opportunity of shutting her out
of Doors, and that therefore she had retir'd herself to such
a Place; naming a Relation of her own, as scandalous as
herself; and that she hop'd I would not give her the Trou-
ble to sue for her Support, in the ordinary Course of Law,
but that as her Occasions requir'd, she should draw Bills
upon me, which she expefted I would not refuse.
I was extremely satisfied with this Proceeding, and
took Care to let her hear of it, tho' I gave no Answer at all
to her Letter, and as I had taken Care before, that when-
ever she play'd such a Prank as this, she should not be
able to carry much with her; so after she was gone, I im-
mediately broke up House-keeping, sold my Furniture
by publick Out-cry, and in it every Thing in particular
that was her own, and set a Bill upon my Door, giving her
to understand by it, that she had passed the Rubicon, that
as she had taken such a Step of her own Accord, so there
was no Room left her ever to think of coming back again.
This was what any one may believe I should not have
done, if I had seen any Room for a Reformation; but she
had given me such Testimonies of a Mind alienated from
her Husband in particular, espousing her own unsuffer-
able Lenity, that there was indeed no possibility of our
coming afterwards to any Terms again.
However, I kept a couple of trusty Agents so near her,
that I fail'd not to have a full Account of her Conduct,
tho' I never let her know any Thing of me, but that I was
gone over to France; as to her Bills which she said she
would draw upon me, she was as good as her Word in
drawing one of 30 /. which I refused to accept, and never
i6 The L i f e of Colonel Jack
It is true, and I must acknowledge it, that all this was
a very melancholy Scene of Life to me, and but that she
took Care by carrying herself to the last Degree provok-
ing, and continually to insult me, I could never have
gone on to the parting with so much Resolution, for I
really lov'd her very sincerely, and could have been any
Thing but a Beggar and a Cuckold with her, but those
were intollerable to me, especially, as they were put upon
me with so much insult and rudeness.
But my Wife carried it at last to a Point that made all
Things light and easy to me, for after above a Years Sepa-
ration, and keeping such Company as she thought fit, she
was pleased to be with Child again, in which she had,
however, so much Honesty, as not to pretend that she
had had any Thing to do with me; what a wretched Life
she led after this, and how she brought herself to the ut-
most Extremity of Misery and Distress, I may speak of
hereafter.
I had found soon after our parting, that I had a great
deal of Reason to put myself into a Posture at first, not to
be imposed upon by her; for I found very quickly that
she had run herself into Debt in several Places very con-
siderably; and that it was upon a Supposition, that I was
liable to those Debts: But I was gone, and it was absolute-
ly necessary I should do so; upon which, she found herself
oblig'd out of her wicked Gains, however, whatever she
made of them to discharge most those Debts herself.
As soon as she was deliver'd of her Child, in which my
Intelligence was so good, that I had gotten sufficient
Proof of it; I sued her in the Ecclesiastical Court, in order
to obtain a Divorce, and as she found it impossible to
avoid it, so she declin'd the Defence, and I gain'd a legal
Decree, or what they call it, of Divorce, in the usual Time
of such Process, and now I thought myself a Freeman
once again, and began to be sick of Wedlock with all my
Heart.
I liv'd retir'd, because I knew she had contracted
Debts which I should be oblig'd to pay, and I was resolv'd
to be gone out of her Reach, with what Speed I could,
but it was necessary that I should stay till the Virginia
Fleet came in; because I look'd for at least 300 Hogs-
heads of Tobacco from thence, which I knew would heal
all my Breaches; for indeed the Extravagance of 3 Years
vol. ii c
with this Lady, had sunk me most effectually, even far
beyond her own Fortune, which was considerable, tho'
not quite i500 /. as she had call'd it.
But all the Mischiefs I met with on Account of this
Match, were not over yet, for when I had been parted
with her about three Months, and had refused to accept
her Bill of 30 /. which I mention'd above, tho' I was re-
mov'd from my first Lodgings too, and thought I had ef-
fectually secur'd myself from being found out, yet there
came a Gentleman well dressed to my Lodgings one Day,
and was let in before I knew of it, or else I should scarce
have admitted him.
He was led into a Parlour, and I came down to him in
my Gown and Slippers; when I came into the Room, he
call'd me as familiarly by my Name, as if he had known
me 20 Year, and pulling out a Pocket-Book, he shows me
a Bill upon me, drawn by my Wife, which was the same
Bill for 30 /. that I had refused before.
Sir, says I, this Bill has been presented before, and I
gave my Answer to it then.
Answer! Sir, says he, with a kind of jeering taunting
Air, I don't understand what you mean by an Answer, it
is not a Question Sir, it is a Bill to be paid.
Well Sir, says I, it is a Bill I know that, and I gave my
Answer to it before.
Sir, Sir, says he, very saucily, your Answer! there's no
Answer to a Bill, it must be paid, Bills are to be paid, not
to be answered, they say you are a Merchant Sir, Mer-
chants always pay their Bills.
I begun to be angry too a little, but I did not like my
Man, for I found he began to be quarrelsome; however I
said, Sir, I perceive you are not much used to presenting
Bills; Sir, a Bill is always first presented, and presenting is
a Question, 'tis asking if I will accept, or pay the Bill, and
then whether I say yes or no, 'tis an Answer one Way or
other; after 'tis accepted, it indeed requires no more An-
swer but Payment when 'tis due, if you please to inform
yourself, this is the Usage which all Merchants or Trades-
men of any kind, who have Bills drawn upon them act by.
Well Sir, says he, and what then? What is this to the
paying me the 30 /.
Why Sir, says I, it is this to it, that I told the Person
that brought it, I should not pay it.
Not pay it! says he, but you shall pay it, ay, ay, you will
pay it.
She that draws it, has no Reason to draw any Bills up-
on me, I am sure, said I, and I shall pay no Bills she draws
I assure you.
Upon this, he turns short upon me, Sir, she that draws
this Bill is a Person of too much Honour to draw any Bill
without Reason, and 'tis an Affront to say so of her, and I
shall expect Satisfaction of you for that by itself; but first
the Bill Sir, the Bill, you must pay the Bill Sir.
I return'd as short, Sir, I affront no body. I know the
Person as well as you I hope, and what I have said of her
is no Affront, she can have no Reason to draw Bills upon
me, for I owe her nothing.
I omit intermingling the Oaths he lac'd his Speech
with, as too foul for my Paper, but he told me he would
make me know she had Friends to stand by her, that I
had abused her, and he would let me know it, and do her
Justice; but first, I must pay his Bill.
I answer'd in short, I would not pay the Bill, nor any
Bills she should draw.
With that he steps to the Door and shuts it, and swore
by G—d he would make me pay the Bill before we part-
ed, and laid his Hand upon his Sword, but did not draw it
out.
I confess I was frighted to the last Degree, for I had no
Sword, and if I had, I must own, that tho' I had learn'd a
great many good Things in France to make me look like a
Gentleman, I had forgot the main Article of learning how
to use a Sword, a Thing so universally practised there;
and to say more, I had been perfectly unacquainted with
Quarrels of this Nature; so that I was perfectly surprised
when he shut the Door, and knew not what to say or do.
However as it happen'd,the People of the Househear-
ing us pretty loud, came near the Door, and made a Noise
in the Entry, to let me know they were at Hand, and one
of the Servants going to open the Door, and finding it
lock'd, call'd out to me, Sir, for God's Sake open the
Door! What is the Matter? Shall we fetch a Constable? I
made no Answer, but it gave me Courage, so I sat down
composed in one of the Chairs, and said to him; Sir, this
is not the Way to make me pay the Bill, you had much
better be easy, and take your Satisfaction another Way.
He understood me of fighting, which upon my Word
was not in my Thoughts, but I meant that he had better
take his Course at Law.
With all my Heart, says he, they say you are a Gentle-
man, and they call you Colonel; now if you are a Gentle-
man, I accept your Challenge Sir, and if you will walk
out with me, I'll take it for full Payment of the Bill, and
will decide it as Gentlemen ought to do.
I challenge you Sir! said I, not I, I made no Chal-
lenge, I said, this is not the Way to make me pay a Bill
that I have not accepted, that is, that you had better seek
your Satisfaction at Law.
Law! says he, Law! Gentleman's Law is my Law; in
short Sir, you shall pay me or fight me, and then, as if he
had mistaken, he turns short upon me, nay, says he, you
shall both fight me and pay me, for I will maintain her
Honour; and in saying this he bestowed about 6 or 7
Damme's and Oaths, by Way of Parenthesis.
This Interval deliver'd me effectually, for just as the
Word fight me, for I will maintain her Honour, the Maid
had brought in a Constable, with 3 or 4 Neighbours to as-
sist him.
He heard them come in, and began to be a little in a
Rage, and asked him if I intended to mob him instead of
paying, and laying his Hand on his Sword, told me, if
any Man offered to break in upon him, he would run me
thro' the first Moment, that he might have the fewer to
deal with afterwards.
I told him he knew I had call'd for no Help, believing
he could not be in earnest in what he had said, and that if -
any Body attempted to come in upon us, it was to prevent
the Mischief he threaten'd, and which he might see I had
no Weapons to resist.
Upon this the Constable call'd, and charg'd us both in
the King's Name to open the Door, I was sitting in a
Chair, and offer'd to rise, he made a Motion as if he would
draw, upon which I sat down again, and the Door not be-
ing open'd, the Constable set his Foot against it and came
in.
Well Sir, says my Gentleman, and what now? What's
your Business here? Nay Sir, says the Constable, you see
my Business, I am a Peace Officer, all I have to do is to
keep the Peace, and I find, the People of the House fright-
ed for Fear of Mischief should be between you, have
fetch'd me to prevent it; what Mischief have they sup-
posed you should find, says he, I suppose, says the Con-
stable, they were afraid you shou'd fight; that's because
they did not know this Fellow here, he never fights, they
call him Colonel, says he, I suppose he might be born a
Colonel, for I dare say, he was born a Coward; he never
fights, he dares not see a Man, if he would have fought he
would have walk'd out with me, but he scorns to be brave,
they would never have talk'd to you of fighting, if they
had known him: I tell you Mr. Constable he is a Coward,
and a Coward is a Rascal; and with that he came to me,
and strok'd his Finger down my Nose pretty hard, and
laugh'd and mock'd most horridly, as if I was a Coward;
now for ought I knew it might be true, but I was now
what they call a Coward made desperate, which is one of
the worst of Men in the World to encounter with, for be-
ing in a Fury, I threw my Head in his Face, and closing
with him, threw him fairly on his Back by main Strength,
and had not the Constable step'd in and taken me off, I
had certainly stamp'd him to Death with my Feet, for my
Blood was now all in a Flame, and the People of the House
were frighted now as much the other Way, least I should
kill him, tho' I had no Weapon at all in my Hand.
The Constable too reprov'd me in his Turn, but I said
to him, Mr. Constable, don't you think I am sufficiently
provok'd? Can any Man bear such Things as these? I de-
sire to know who this Man is, and who sent him hither?
I am, says he, a Gentleman, and come with a Bill to him
for Money, and he refuses to pay it; well, says the Con-
stable very prudently, that's none of my Business, I am
no Justice of Peace to hear the Cause, be that among your
selves, but keep your Hands off of one another, and that's
as much as I desire; and therefore Sir, says the Constable
to him, if I may advise you, seeing he will not pay the
Bill, and that must be decided between you as the Law
directs, I would have you leave it for the present, and go
quietly away.
He made many impertinent Harangues about the Bill,
and insisted, that it was drawn by my own Wife; I said
angrily, then it was drawn by a Whore, he bullied me up-
on that, told me I durst not tell him so any where else; so
I answer'd, I would very soon publish her for a Whore to
all the World, and cry her down, and thus we scolded for
near half an Hour, for I took Courage when the Con-
stable was there, for I knew that he would keep us from
fighting, which indeed I had no Mind too, and so at
length I got rid of him.
I was heartily vex'd at this Rencounter, and the more,
because I had been found out in my Lodging, which I
thought I had effectually conceal'd; however I resolv'd
to remove the next Day, and in the mean Time I kept
within Doors all that Day till the Evening, and then I
went out in order not to return thither any more.
Being come out into Grace-cburcb-Sfreet, I observ'd a
Man follow me, with one of his Legs tied up in a String,
and hopping along with the other, and two Crutches; he
begg'd for a Farthing, but I enclining not to give him any
Thing, the Fellow follow'd me still, till I came to a Court,
when I answer'd hastily to him, I have not for you? Pray
don't be so troublesome, with which Words he knock'd
me down with his Crutches.
Being stunn'd with the Blow, I knew nothing what
was done to me afterwards; but coming to myself again, I
found I was wounded very frightfully in several Places,
and that among the rest my Nose was slit upwards, one
of my Ears almost cut off, and a great Cut with a Sword
on the Side of the Forehead, also a Stab into the Body,
tho' not dangerous.
Who had been near me, or struck me, besides the
Cripple that struck me with his Crutch I knew not, nor
do I know to this Hour, but I was terribly wounded, and
lay bleeding on the Ground sometime, till coming to my-
self I got Strength to cry out for Help, and People com-
ing about me, I got some Hands to carry me to my Lodg-
ing, where I lay by it more than two Months before I was
well enough to go out of Doors, and when I did go out,
I had Reason to believe that I was waited for by some
Rogues,who watch'd an Opportunity to repeat the Injury
I had met with before.
This made me very uneasy, and I resolv'd to get my-
self out of Danger if possible, and to go over to France, or
Home, as I call'd it, to Virginia; so to be out of the Way of
Villains and Assassinations, for every Time I stirr'd out
here, I thought I went in Danger of my Life, and therefore,
as before I went out at Night thinking to be conceal'd, so
now I never went out but in open Day, that I might be
safe, and never without one or two Servants to be myLife-
Guard.
But I must do my Wife a Piece of Justice here too, and
that was, that hearing of what had befallen me, she wrote
me a Letter, in which she treated me more decently than
she had been wont to do, said she was very sorry to hear
how I had been used, and the rather because she under-
stood it was on presenting her Bill to me; she said she
hop'd I could not in my worst Dispositions think so hard-
ly of her, as to believe it was done by her Knowledge or
Consent, much less by her Order or Direction; that she
abhorr'd such Things, and protested if she had the least
Knowledge, or so much as a Guess at the Villains con-
cern'd she would discover them to me; she let me know
the Person's Name to whom she gave the Bill, and where
he liv'd, and left it to me to oblige him to discover the
Person who had brought it, and used me so ill, and wish'd
I might find him, and bring him to Justice, and have him
punish'd with the utmost Severity of the Law.
I took this so kindly of my Wife, that I think in my
Conscience, had she come after it herself, to see how I
did, I had certainly taken her again; but she satisfied her-
self with the Civility of another Letter, and desiring me
to let her know as often as I could how I was, adding,
that it would be infinitely to her Satisfaction, to hear I
was recover'd of the Hurt I had receiv'd, and that he was
hang'd at Tyburn who had done it.
She used some Expressions, signifying as I under-
stood them, her Affliction at our parting, and her con-
tinu'd Respect for me, but did not make any Motion to-
wards returning; then she used some Arguments to move
me to pay her Bills, intimating that she had brought me a
large Fortune, and now had nothing to subsist, which
was very severe.
I wrote her an Answer to this Letter, tho'I had not to
the other, letting her know how I had been used, that I
was satisfied upon her Letter, that she had no Hand in it,
that it was not in her Nature to treat me so, who had never
injur'd her, used any Violence with her, or been the Cause
or Desire of our Parting; that as to her Bill, she could not
but know how much her expensive Way of living had
straitn'd and reduc'd me, and would if continu'd have
ruin'd me, that she had in less than 3 Years spent more
than as much as she brought to me, and would not abate
her expensive Way, tho' calmly intreated by me, with
Protestations, that I could not Support so great an Ex-
pence, but chose rather to break up her Family and go
from me, than to restrain herself to reasonable Limits,
tho' I used no Violence with her, but Entreaties, and
earnest Perswasions, back'd with good Reason; letting
her know how my Estate was, and convincing her that it
must reduce us to Poverty at least; that however, if she
would recall her Bill I would send her 30 /. which was the
Sum mention'd in her Bill, and according to my Ability
would not let her want, if she pleased to live within due
Bounds; but then I let her know also, that I had a very
bad Account of her Conduct, and that she kept Com-
pany with a scandalous Fellow, who I nam'd to her; that
I was loth to believe such Things of her, but that to put
an entire End to the Report, and restore her Reputation,
I let her know that still after all I had heard, if she would
resolve to live without Restraints, within the reasonable
Bounds of my Capacity, and treat me with the same Kind-
ness, Affection, and Tenderness, as I always had treated
her, and ever would: I was willing to receive her again,
and would forget all that was past; but that if she declin'd
me now, it wou'd be for ever, for if she did not accept my
Offer, I was resolv'd to stay here no longer, where I had
been so ill treated on many Occasions, but was preparing
to go into my own Country, where I would spend my
Days in quiet, and in a Retreat from the World.
She did not give such an Answer to this as I expected;
for tho' she thank'd me for the 30 /. yet she insisted upon
her Justification in all other Points, and tho' she did not
refuse to return to me, yet she did not say she accepted it,
and in short, said little or nothing to it, only a kind of
Claim to a Reparation of her injur'd Reputation and the
like.
This gave me some Surprize at first, for I thought in-
deed, any Woman in her Circumstances would have been
very willing to have put an End to all her Miseries, and
to the Reproach which was upon her, by a Reconciliation;
especially considering, she subsisted at that Time but
very meanly: But there was a particular Reason which
prevented her Return, and which she cou'd not plead to
in her Letter, yet was a good Reason against accepting an
Offer, which she would otherwise have been glad of, and
this was that as I have mention'd above, she had fallen in-
to bad Company, and had prostituted her Vertue to some
of her Flatterers, and in short, was with Child; so that she
durst not venture to accept my Offer.
However, as I observ'd above, she did not absolutely
refuse it, intending (as I understood afterward) to keep
the Treaty of it on Foot, till she could drop her Burthen,
as she call'd it before; and having been deliver'd private-
ly, have accepted my Proposal afterward; and indeed this
was the most prudent Step she cou'd take, or, as we may
say, the only Step she had left to take: But I was too many
for her here too, my Intelligence about her was too good
for her to conceal such an Affair from me, unless she had
gone away before she was visibly big, and unless she had
gone farther off too than she did, for I had an Account to
a Tittle, of the Time when, and Place where, and the
Creature of which she was deliver'd, and then my Offers
of taking her again were at an End, tho' she wrote me
several penitent Letters, acknowledging her Crime, and
begging me to forgive her; but my Spirit was above all
that now, nor cou'd I ever bear the Thoughts of her after
that, but pursued a Divorce, and accordingly obtain'd it,
as I have mention'd already.
Thi ngs being at this pass, I resolv'd (as I have observ'd
above) to go over to France, after I had receiv'd my Ef-
fects from Virginia, and accordingly I came to Dunkirk in
the Year and here I fell into Company with some
Irish Officers of the Regiment of Dillon, who by little and
little enter'd me into the Army, and by the Help of Lieu-
tenant General an Irishman, and some Money, I ob-
tain'd a Company in his Regiment, and so went into the
Army directly.
I was exceedingly pleased with my new Circumstances,
and now I used to say to myself, I was come to what I was
born to, and that I had never till now liv'd the Life of a
Gentleman.
Our Regiment, after I had been some Time in it, was
Commanded into Italy, and one of the most considerable
Actions that I was in, was the famous Attack upon Cre-
mona, in the Millanese, where the Germans being private-
ly, and by Treachery let into the Town in the Night,
thro' a kind of Common Shoar, surpriz'd the Town, and
got Possession of the greatest Part of it, surprizing the
Mareschal Duke de Villeroy, and taking him Prisoner as
he came out of his Quarters, and beating the few French
Troops which were left into the Citadel; but were in the
middle of their Victory so boldly and resolutely attack'd
by two Irish Regiments, who were quarter'd in the Street
leading to the River Po, and who kept Possession of the
Water-Gate, or Po Gate of the Town, by which the Ger-
man Reinforcements should have come in, that after a
most desperate Fight, the Germans had their Victory
wrung out of their Hands, and not being able to break
thro' us to let in their Friends, were oblig'd at length to
quit the Town again, to the eternal Honour of those Irish
Regiments, and indeed of their whole Nation, and for
which we had a very handsome Compliment from the
King of France.
I Nowhad the Satisfaction of knowing, and that for the
first Time too, that I was not that cowardly low spirited
Wretch that I was, when the Fellow bullied me in my
Lodgings, about the Bill of 30 /. had he attack'd me now,
tho' in the very same Condition, I should, naked and un-
arm'd as I was, have flewn in the Face of him, and tram-
pl'd him under my Feet; but Men never know them-
selves till they are tried, and Courage is acquir'd by Time
and Experience of Things.
Phillip de Comines tells us, that after the Battle of
Monteleri, the Count de Charlois, who till then had an utter
Aversion to the War, and abhorr'd it, and every Thing
that belong'd to it, was so chang'd by the Glory he ob-
tain'd in that Action, and by the Flattery of those about
him, that afterwards the Army was his Mistress, and the
Fatigues of the War his chief Delight; 'tis too great an
Example for me to bring in my own Case, but so it was,
that they flatter'd me so with my Bravery, as they call'd
it, on the Occasion of this Action, that I fancy'd myself
brave, whether I was so or not, and the Pride of it made
me bold and daring to the last Degree on all Occasions;
but what added to it was, that some Body gave a Particu-
lar Account to the Court of my being instrumental to the
saving the City, and the whole Cremonese, by my extra-
ordinary Defence of the Po Gate, and by my managing
that Defence after the Lieutenant Colonel, who com-
manded the Party where I was posted was kill'd; upon
which, the King sent me a publick Testimony of his ac-
cepting my Service, and sent me a Breviat to be a Lieu-
tenant-Colonel, and the next Courier brought me actually
a Commission for Lieutenant-Colonel in the Regiment
of .
I was in several Skirmishes and petty Encounters be-
fore this, by which I gain'd the Reputation of a good Offi-
cer, but I happen'd to be in some particular Posts too, by
which I got somewhat that I lik'd much better, and that
was a good deal of Money.
Our Regiment was sent from France to Italyby Sea, we
embark'd at Thoulon, and landed at Savona, in the Terri-
tory of Genoa, and marched from thence to the Dutchy of
Milan: At the first Town we were sent to take Possession
of, which was Alexandria, the Citizens rose upon our Men
in a most furious manner, and drove the whole Garrison,
which consisted of 800 Men, that is French, and Soldiers
in the French Service, quite out of Town.
I was quarter'd in a Burghers House, just by one of the
Ports, with 8 of my Men and a Servant, where calling a
short Council with my Men, we was resolved to main-
tain the House we was in,whatever it cost, till we received
Orders to quit it from the Commanding Officer; upon
this, when I saw our Men cou'd not stand their Ground
in the Street, being pressed hard by the Citizens, I turn'd
out of Doors all the Family, and kept the House as a Cas-
tle, which I was Governor in; and as the House join'd to
the City Gate, I resolv'd to maintain it, so as to be the last
that should quit the Place, my own Retreat being secur'd
by being so near the Port.
Having thus emptied the House of the Inhabitants,
we made no Scruple of filling our Pockets with whatever
we could find there, in a Word, we left nothing we could
carry away, among which, it came to my Lot to dip into
the Burgher's Cabinet, whose House it was where we
were, and there I took about the quantity of 200 Pistoles
in Money and Plate, and other Things of Value. There
was great Complaint made to Prince Vaudemont, who was
then Governor of the Millanese of this Violence; but as
the Repulse the Citizens gave us was contrary to his
Order, and to the general Design of the Prince, who was
then wholly in the Interest of King Philip, the Citizens
cou'd obtain nothing, and I found, that if we had plun-
der'd the whole City, it would have been the same Thing;
for the Governor had Orders to take our Regiment in,
and it was an Act of open Rebellion to resist us as they
did; however we had Orders not to fire upon the Bur-
ghers, unless constrain'd to it by evidently Necessity, and
we rather chose to quit the Place as we did, then dispute
it with a desperate Body of Fellows, who wanted no Ad-
vantage of us, except only that, of having Possession of
two Bastions, and one Port of our Retreat; first they were
treble our Number, for the Burghers being joined by 7
Companies of the regular Troops, made up above i600
Men besides Rabble, which was many more, whereas we
were about 800 in all; they also had the Citadel and seve-
ral Pieces of Cannon, so that we cou'd have made nothing
of it, if we had attack'd them; but they submitted 3 or 4
Days after to other Forces, the Soldiers within turning
upon them, and taking the Citadel from them.
After this, we lay still in Quarters 8 Months, for the
Prince having secur'd the whole Millanese for King Phil-
lip, and no Enemy appearing for some Time, had nothing
to do, but to receive the Auxiliar Troops of France; and
as they came, extend himself every Way as he cou'd, in
order to keep the Imperialists (who were preparing to
fall into Italy with a great Army) as much at a Distance as
possible, which he did, by taking Possession of the City
of Mantua, and of most of the Towns on that Side, as far
as the Lake De la Guarda, and the River Addige.
We lay in Mantua some Time, but were afterwards
drawn out by Order of the Count de Tesse, (afterwards
Marshal of France) to form the French Army till the Ar-
rival of the Duke de Vandosme, who was to Command in
Chief. Here we had a severe Campaign, Anno 1701. hav-
ing Prince Eugene of Savoy, and an Army of 40000 Ger-
mans, all old Soldiers to deal with, and tho' the French
Army was more numerous than the Enemy, by 2 5000
Men, yet being on the defensive, and having so many
Posts to cover, not knowing exactly where the Prince of
Savoy, who commanded the Imperial Army, would at-
tack us, it oblig'd the French to keep their Troops so di-
vided, and so remote from one another, that the Germans
push'd on their Design with great Success, as the His-
tories of those Times more fully relate.
I was at the Action at Carpi, July 1701, where we were
worsted by the Germans indeed, were forc'd to quit our
Encampment, and give up to the Prince the whole River
of Addige, and where our Regiment sustain'd some Loss,
but the Enemies got little by us, and Monsieur Catinate,
who Commanded at that Time, drew up in Order of Bat-
tle the next Day in Sight of the German Army, and gave
them a Defiance, but they would not stir, tho' we offer'd
them Battle two Days together, for having gain'd the
Passage over the Addige, by our quitting Rivo/i, which
was then useless to us, their Business was done.
Finding they declin'd a decisive Action, our Generals
pressed them in their Quarters, and made them fight for
every Inch of Ground they gained, and at length in the
September following, we attack'd them in their entrench'd
Posts of Chiar, here we broke into the very Heart of their
Camp, where we made a very terrible Slaughter, but I
know not by what Mistake among our Generals, or De-
fect in the Execution of their Orders, the Brigade of Nor-
mandy and our Irish Brigade, who had so bravely enter'd
the German Entrenchments, were not supported as we
should have been, so that we were oblig'd to sustain the
shock of the whole German Army, and at last to quit the
Advantage we had gain'd, and that not without Loss, but
being timely reinforced by a great Body of Horse, the
Enemy were in their Turn beaten off too, and driven
back into their very camp: The Germans boasted of hav-
ing a great Victory here, and indeed in repulsing us after
we had gain'd their Camp, they had the Advantage, but
had Monsieur de Tesse succoured us in Time, as old Ca-
tinat said he ought to have done, with i2000 Foot which
he had with him, that Days Action had put an End to the
War, and Prince Eugene must have been glad to have
gone back to Germany, in more Haste than he came, if
perhaps we had not cut him short by the Way.
But the Fate of Things went another Way, and the
Germans continu'd all that Campaign to push forward,
and advance one Post after another, till they beat us quite
out of the Millanese.
vol. ii d
The latter Part of this Campaign we made only a party
War, the French, according to their volatile Temper, be-
ing every Day abroad, either foraging or surprizing the
Enemy's Foragers, plundering or circumventing the
Plunders of the other Side, and that tho' they very often
come short Home; for the Germans had the better of
them on several Occasions, and indeed so many lost their
Lives upon those petty Encounters, that I think, includ-
ing those who died of Distempers gotten by hard Ser-
vice, and bad Quarters, lying in the Field even till the
Middle of December, among Rivers and Bogs, in a Coun-
try so full of Canals and Rivers, as that Part of Italy is
known to be, I say, we lost more Men, and so did the
Enemy also, than would have been lost in a general de-
cisive Battle.
The Duke of Savoy, to give him his due, press'd earn-
estly to put it to a Day, and come to a Battle with Prince
Eugene; but the Duke de Villeroy, Monsieur Catinate, and
the Count de Tesse, were all against it, and the principal
Reason was, that they knew the Weakness of the Troops,
who had suffer'd so much on so many Occasions, that
they were in no Condition to give Battle to the Germans;
so after, as I say, about three Months harrassing one an-
other with Parties, we went into Winter-Quarters.
Before we march'd out of the Field, our Regiment,
with a Detachment of Dragoons of 600, and about 250
Horse, went without a Design to intercept Prince Com-
mercy, a General of Note under Prince Eugene of Savoy\
the Detachment was intended to be only Horse and Dra-
goons, but because it was the Imperialists good Luck to
beat many of our Parties, and, as was given out, many
more than we beat of theirs; and because it was believed
that the Prince, who was an Officer of good Note among
them, would not go Abroad, but in very little Company,
the Irish Regiment of Foot was order'd to be added, that
if possible they might meet with their Match.
I was commanded about two Hours before, to pass
about 200 Foot, and 50 Dragoons, at a small Wood,
where our General had Intelligence that Prince would
post some Men, to secure his Passage, which according-
ly I did; but Count Tesse not thinking our Party strong
enough, had march'd himself with a Thousand Horse,
and 300 Grenadiers to support us, and it was very well he
did so; for Prince Commercy having Intelligence of the
first Party, came forward sooner than they expected, and
fell upon them, and had entirely routed them, had not the
Count, (hearing the firing) advanc'd with the Thousand
Horse he had with such Expedition, as to support his
Men in the very Heat of the Action, by which Means the
Germans were defeated, and forc'd to retire; but the
Prince made a pretty good Retreat, and after the Action,
came on to the Wood, where I was posted, but the Sur-
prize of his Defeat had prevented his sending a Detach-
ment to secure the Pass at the Wood, as he intended.
The Count de Tesse, understanding that we were sent
(as above) to the Wood, follow'd them close at the Heels,
to prevent our being cut off, and if it were possible that
we should give them any Check at the Wood, to fall in,
and have another Brush with them; it was near Night be-
fore they came to the Wood, by which Means they could
not discern our Number; but when they came up to the
Wood, 50 Dragoons advanc'd to discover the Pass, and
see if all was clear: These we suffer'd to pass a great Way
into the Defile, or Lane, that went thro' the Wood, and
then clapping in between them and the Entrance, cut off
their Retreat so effectually, that when they discover'd us,
and fir'd, they were instantly surrounded, and cut in
Pieces; the Officer who commanded them, and eight
Dragoons only being made Prisoners.
This made the Prince halt, not knowing what the Case
was, or how strong we were, and to get better Intelligence,
sent 200 Horse to surround or skirt the Wood, and beat
up our Quarter, and in the Interim, the Count de Tesse
appear'd in his Rear: We found the Strait he was in, by
the Noise of our own Troops at a Distance, so we resolv'd
to engage the 200 Horse immediately; accordingly our
little Troop of Horse drew up in the Entrance of the
Lane, and offer'd to skirmish, and our Foot lying behind
the Hedge, which went round the Wood, stood ready to
act as Occasion should offer, the Horse being attack'd,
gave Way, and retir'd into the Lane, but the Germans
were too old for us there, they contented themselves to
push us to the Entrance, but would not be drawn into a
narrow Pass without knowing whether the Hedges were
lin'd or no.
But the Prince finding the French in his Rear, and not
being strong enough to engage again, resolv'd to force
his Way thro', and commanded his Dragoons to a-light,
and enter the Wood, to clear the Hedges on either Side
the Lane, that he might pass with his Cavalry; this they
did so vigorously, and were so much too strongforus, that
tho' we made good our Ground a long Time, yet our Men
were almost half of them cut in Pieces. However, we gave
Time to the French Cavalry to come up, and to fall on the
Prince's Troops, and cut them off, and take a great many
Prisoners, and then retreated in our Turn, opening a
Gap for our own Horse to break in; 300 of the Dragoons
were kill'd, and 200 of them taken Prisoners.
In the first Heat of this Action, a German Officer of
Dragoons well follow'd, had knock'd down three Men
that stood next me, and offering me Quarter, I was ob-
lig'd to accept it, and gave him my Sword, for our Men
were upon the Point of quitting their Post, and shifting
every one as they could; but the Scale was turn'd, for our
Cavalry breaking in, (as above) the Dragoons went to
"Wreck, and the Officer who had me Prisoner, turning to
me said, We are alllosl; I asked him if I could serve him?
Stand slill a little, says he; for his Men fought most des-
perately indeed, but about 200 French Horse appearing
in his Rear too, he said to me in French, I will be your Pri-
soner, and returning me my Sword, gave me also his own;
a Dragoon that stood near him was just going to do the
like, when he was shot dead, and the Horse coming up,
the Field was cleared in an Instant; but Prince Commercy
went off with the rest of his Party, and was pursued no
farther.
There were 16 or 17 of our Men releas'd, as I was,
from being taken; but they had not the Luck I had, to
take the Officer that had them in keeping; he had been so
generous to me, as not to ask what Money I had about
me, tho' I had not much, if he had; but I lost by his Civil-
ity, for then I could not have the Assurance to ask him for
his Money, tho' I understood he had near a 100 Pistoles
about him; but he very handsomely at Night, when we
came to our Tents, made me a Present of 20 Pistoles, and
in Return, I obtain'd Leave for him to go to Prince
Eugene's Camp upon his Parole, which he did, and so got
himself exchang'd.
It was after this Campaign that I was quartered at Cre-
mona, when the Action happen'd there, of which I have
spoken already, and where our Irish Regiment did such
Service, that they sav'd the Town from being really sur-
priz'd, and indeed beat the Germans out again, after they
had been Masters of three Quarters of the Town six
Hours, and by which they gain'da very great Reputation.
But I hasten on to my own History, for I am not writ-
ing a Journal of the Wars, in which I had no long Share.
The Summer after this, our two Irish Regiments were
drawn out into the Field, and had many a sore Brush with
the Germans; for Prince Eugene, a vigilant General, gave
us little Rest, and gain'd many Advantages by his con-
tinual moving up and down, harrassing his own Men and
ours too; and whoever will do the French Justice, and
knew how they behaved, must acknowledge, they never
declin'd the Germans, but fought them upon all Occa-
sions, with the utmost Resolution and Courage; and tho'
it cost the Blood of an infinite Number of fine Gentlemen,
as well as private Soldiers, yet the Duke de Vendome, who
now commanded, tho' King Philip was himself in the
Army this Campaign, made the Prince of Savoy a full Re-
turn in his own Kind, and drove him from Post to Post,
till he was just at the Point of quitting the whole Country
of Italy; all that gallant Army Prince Eugene brought
with him into Italy, which was the best without doubt, for
the Goodness of the Troops, that ever were there, laid
their Bones in that Country, and many Thousands more
after them; till the Affairs of France declining in other
Places, they were forc'd in their Turn to give Way to
their Fate, as may be seen in the Histories of those Times
as above; but 'tis none of my Business.
The Part that I bore in these Affairs was but short and
sharp, we took the Field about the Beginning of July
1702, and the Duke de Vendome order'd the whole Army
to draw the sooner together in order to relieve the City of
Mantua, which was block'd up by the Imperialisls.
Pr1nce Eugene was a Politick, and indeed a fortunate
Prince, and had the Year before pushed our Army upon
many Occasions; but his good Fortune began to fail him
a little this Year, for our Army was not only more Nume-
rous than his, but the Duke was in the Field before him;
and as the Prince had held Mantua closely block'd up all
the Winter, the Duke resolved to relieve the Town, cost
what it would: As I said, the Duke was first in the Field,
the Prince was in no Condition to prevent his raising the
Blockade by Force; so he drew off his Troops, and leav-
ing several strong Bodies of Troops to protect Bersello,
which the Duke de Vendome threaten'd, and Borgofort,
where his Magazine lay, he drew all the rest of his Forces
together, to make Head against us; by this Time the
King of Spain was come into the Army, and the Duke de
Vendome lay, with about 3 5000 Men, near Luzara, which
he had resolv'd to attack, to bring Prince Eugene to a Bat-
tle : The Prince of Vaudemont lay entrench'd with 20000
more at Rivalto, behind Mantua, to cover the Frontiers of
Millan, and there was near 12000 in Mantua itself; and
Monsieur Pracontal lay with 10000 Men just under the
Cannon of one of the Forts, which guard the Causeway,
which leads into the City of Mantua: So that had all these
join'd, as they would have done in a few Days more, the
Prince must have been put to his Shifts, and would have
had enough to do, to have maintain'd himself in Italy; for
he was Master of no one Place in the Country, that could
have held out a formal Siege of fifteen Days open Tren-
ches, and he knew all this very well; and therefore, it
seems, while the Duke of Vendosme resolv'd, if possible,
to bring him to a Battle, and to that End, made Disposi-
tions to attack Luzara; we were surpriz'd to find the
15th of June, 1702, the whole Imperial Army appear'd
in Batalia, and in full March to attack us.
As it happen'd, our Army was all marching in Columns
towards them, as we had done for two Days before, and I
should have told you, that three Days before, the Duke
having Notice that General Visconti, with three Imperial
Regiments of Horse, and one of Dragoons, was posted at
San-Viftoria, on the Tessona; he resolv'd to attack them,
and this Design was carried so secretly, that while Mon-
sieur Visconti, tho' our Army was three Leagues another
Way, passing towards the Modenese, he found himself
unexpectedly attack'd by 6000 Horse and Dragoons of
the French Army: He defended himself very bravely, for
near an Hour; when being over-power'd, and finding he
should be forc'd into Disorder, he sounded a Retreat; but
the Squadrons had not fac'd about to make their Retreat,
scarce a Quarter of an Hour, when they found themselves
surrounded with a great Body of Infantry, who had en-
tirely cut off their Retreat, except over the Bridge of Tes-
sona, which being throng'd with their Baggage, they
could neither get backward or forward; so they thrush
and tumbled over one another, in such a Manner, that
they could preserve no kind of Order; but abundance fell
into the River, and were drowned, many were kill'd, and
more taken Prisoners; so that in a Word, the whole three
Regiments of Horse, and one of Dragoons, were entirely
defeated.
This was a great Blow to the Prince, because they were
some of the choicest Troops of his whole Army: We took
about 400 Prisoners, and all their Baggage, which was a
very considerable Booty, and about 800 Horses; and no
doubt these Troops were very much wanted in the Battle
that insued on the i5th, as I have said: Our Army being
in full March (as above) to attack Luzara, a Party of
Germans appear'd, being about 600 Horse, and in less
than an Hour more, their whole Army in order of
Battle.
Our Army form'd immediately, and the Duke posted
the Regiments as they came up, so much to their Advan-
tage, that Prince Eugene was oblig'd to alter his Disposi-
tions, and had this particular Inconvenience upon his
Hands, viz. to attack an Army superior to his own, in all
their most advantageous Posts; whereas had he thought
fit to have waited but one Day, we should have met him
half Way; but this was owing to the Pride of the German
Generals, and their being so opinionated of the Goodness
of their Troops: The Royal Army was posted with the
Left to the great River Po, on the other Side of which the
Prince of Vaudemonfs Army lay, canonading of the In-
trenchments which the Imperialisls had made at Borgo-
Fort, and hearing that there was like to be a general Bat-
tle, he detach'd i2 Battalions, and about i000 Horse, to
reinforce the Royal Army; all which, to our great En-
couragement, had Time to join the Army, while Prince
Eugene was making his new Dispositions for the Attack;
and yet it was the coming of these Troops which caus'd
Prince Eugene to resolve to begin the Fight, expecting to
have come to an Action before they cou'd come up, but
he was disappointed in the Reason of Fighting, and yet
was oblig'd to Fight too, which was an Error in the
Prince, that it was too late to retrieve.
It was Five o'Clock in the Evening before he could
bring up his whole Line to Engage; and then, after hav-
ing canonaded us to no great Purpose for half an Hour,
his Right, commanded by the Prince de Commercy, at-
tacked our left Wing with great Fury: Our Men receiv'd
them so well, and seconded one another so punctually,
that they were repulsed with a very great Slaughter, and
the Prince Commercy being (unhappily for them) kili'd in
the first Onset, the Regiments for want of Orders, and
surpriz'd with the Fall of so great a Man, were push'd in-
to Disorder, and one whole Brigade was entirely broke.
But their second Line advancing, under General Her-
beville, restor'd Things in the first; the Battalions rallied,
and they came boldly on to charge a second Time, and
being seconded, with new Reinforcements from their
main Body, our Men had their Turn, and were push'd to
a Canal, which lay on their left Flank, between them and
the Po, behind which they rallied, and being supported
by new Troops, as well Horse as Foot, they fought on
both Sides with the utmost Obstinacy, and with such
Courage and Skill, that it was not possible to judge who
should have had the better, could they have been able to
have fought it out.
On the Right of the Royal Army, was posted the Flo-
wer of the French Cavalry; namely, the Gens de Arms, the
Royal Carabineers, and the Queen's Horse-Guards, with
400 Horse more, and next them the Infantry, among
which were our Brigade; the Horse advanc'd first to
Charge, and they carried all before them Sword in Hand,
receiving the Fire of two Imperial Regiments of Curias-
sers, without firing a Shot, and falling in among them,
bore them down by the Strength of their Horses, putting
them into Confusion, and left so clear a Field for us to
follow, that the first Line of our Infantry stood drawn up
upon the Ground, which the Enemy at first possess'd.
In this first Attack the Marquis de Crequi, who com-
manded the whole Right Wing, was killed; a Loss,which
fully ballanc'd the Death of the Prince de Commercy, one
the Side of the Germans; after we had thus pushed the
Enemies Cavalry, (as above) their Troops, being rallied
by the Dexterity of their Generals, and supported by
three Imperial Regiments of Foot, they came on again to
the Charge with such Fury, that nothing could withstand
them; and here two Battalions of our Irish Regiments
were put into Disorder, and abundance of our Men kill'd;
and here also I had the Misfortune to receive a Musquet-
Shot, which broke my left Arm; and, that was not all, for
I was knock'd down by a Giant like a German Soldier,
who, when he thought he had kill'd me, set his Foot upon
me, but was immediately shot dead by one of my Men,
and fell just upon me, which, my Arm being broken, was
a very great Mischief to me; for the very Weight of the
Fellow, who was almost as big as a Horse, was such, that
I was not able to stir.
Our Men were beaten back after this, from the Place
where they stood, and so I was left in Possession of the
Enemy, but was not their Prisoner, (that is to say, was not
found) till next Morning, when a Party being sent, as
usual, with Surgeons to look after the wounded Men,
among the Dead, found me almost smothered with the
dead Germans, and others that lay near me; however, to
do them Justice, they us'd me with Humanity, and the
Surgeons set my Arm very skilfully, and well; and after
four or five Days, I had Liberty to go to Parma upon my
Parole.
Both the Armies continued fighting, especially on our
Left, till it was so dark, that it was impossible to know
who they fir'd at, or for the Generals to see what they did;
so they abated firing gradually, and as it may be truly said,
the Night parted them.
Both Sides claim'd the Victory, and both conceal'd
their Losses, as much as was possible; but 'tis certain,
that never Battle was fought with greater Bravery and
Obstinacy than this was, and had there been Day-light to
have fought it out, doubtless there would have been many
Thousand more Men kill'd on both Sides.
All the Germans had,to entitle them to the Victory was,
that they made our Left retire, as I have said,to the Canal,
and to the high Banks, or Mounds on the Edge of the
Po; but they had so much Advantage in the Retreat, they
fir'd from thence among the thickest of the Enemy, and
cou'd never be forc'd from their Posts.
The best Testimony the Royal Army had of the Vic-
tory, and which was certainly the better of the two, was,
that two Days after the Fight, they attack'd Guaflalia, as
it were in View of the German Army, and forc'd the Gari-
son to surrender, and to swear not to serve again for six
Months, which, they being 1500 Men, was a great Loss
to the Germans, and yet Prince Eugene did not offer to re-
lieve it; and after that we took several other Posts, which
the Imperialisls had Possession of, but were oblig'd to quit
them upon the Approach of the French Army, not being
in a Condition to fight another Battle that Year.
My Campaign was now at an End, and tho' I came
Lame off, I came off much better than abundance of
Gentlemen; for in that bloody Battle we had above 400
Officers kill'd or wounded, whereof three were General
Officers.
The Campaign held on till December, and the Duke de
Vendome took Borgo-Fort, and several other Places from
the Germans, who, in short lost Ground every Day in
Italy; I was a Prisoner a great while, and there being no
Chanel settled, Prince Eugene order'd the French Prison-
ers to be sent into Hungary, which was a Cruelty that
could not be reasonably exercised on them; however, a
great many, by that Banishment, found Means to make
their Escape to the Turks, by whom they were kindly re-
ceiv'd, and the French Ambassador at Conslantinople took
Care of them, and shipp'd them back again into Italy at
the King's Charge.
But the Duke de Vendome now took so many Germans
Prisoners, that Prince Eugene was tir'd of sending his
Prisoners to Hungary, and was oblig'd to be at the Charge
of bringing some of them back again, who he had sent
thither, and come to agree to a general Exchange of Pri-
soners.
I was, as I have said, allow'd for a Time to go to Parma,
upon my Parole, where I continu'd for the Recovery of
my Wound, and broken Arm, forty Days and was then
oblig'd to render myself to the commanding Officer at
Ferrara, where Prince Eugene coming soon after, I was,
with several other Prisoners of War, sent away into the
Milanese, to be kept for an Exchange of Prisoners.
It was in the City of Trent, that I continu'd about eight
Months, the Man, in whose House I quartered, was ex-
ceeding civil to me, and took a great deal of Care of me,
and I liv'd very easy; here I contracted a kind of Famili-
arity, perfectly undesign'd by me, with the Daughter of
the Burgher, at whose House I had lodg'd, and I know
not, by what Fatality that was upon me, I was prevail'd
with afterward to marry her: This was a Piece of Honesty
on my Side, which I must acknowledge, I never intended
to be guilty of; but the Girl was too cunning for me; for
she found Means to get some Wine into my Head more
than I us'd to drink, and tho' I was not so disorder'd with
it, but that I knew very well what I did, yet in an unusual
Height of good Humour, I consented to be Married.
This impolitick Piece of Honesty put me to many Incon-
veniences, for I knew not what to do with this new Clog,
which I had loaded myself with, I could neither stay with
her, or take her with me, so that I was exceedingly per-
plex'd.
The Time came soon after that I was releas'd by the
Chartel, and so was oblig'd to go to the Regiment, which
then was in Quarters in the Milanese, and from thence I
got Leave to go to Paris, upon my Promise to raise some
Recruits in England, for the Irish Regiments by the help
of my Correspondence there; having thus Leave to go to
Paris, I took a Passport from the Enemy's Army, to go to
Trent, and making a long Circuit, I went back thither,
and very honestly pack'd up my Baggage, Wife and all,
and brought her away thro' Tyrol, into Bavaria, and so
.thro' Suabia, and the black Foresl into Alsatia, from thence
I came into Lorrain, and so to Paris.
I had now a secret Design to quit the War, for I really
had enough of righting; but it was counted so dishonour-
able a Thing to quit, while the Army was in the Field,
*hat I could not dispense with it; but an intervening Acci-
dent made that Part easy to me: The War was now re-
newed between France, and England, and Holland, jusT: as
it was before; and the French King meditating nothing
more than how to give the English a Diversion, fitted out
a strong Squadron of Men of War and Frigates, at Dun-
kirk, on Board of which he embark'd a Body of Troops, of
about 6500 Men, besides Voluntiers; and the new King,
as we call'd him, tho' more generally he was call'd, the
Chevalier de St. George, was shipp'd along with them, and
all for Scotland.
I pretended a great deal of Zeal for this Service, and
that if I might be permitted to sell my Company in the
Irish Regiment I was in, and have the Chevalier's Brevet
for a Colonel, in Case of raising Troops for him in Great-
Britain, after his Arrival, I would embark Voluntier, and
serve at my own Expence; the latter gave me a great Ad-
vantage with the Chevalier; for now I was esteem'd as a
Man of Consideration, and one that must have a consid-
erable Interest in my own Country; so I obtain'd Leave
to sell my Company, and having had a good round Sum
of Money remitted me from London, by the Way of Hol-
land, I prepar'd a very handsome Equipage, and away I
went to Dunkirk to embark.
I was very well receiv'd by the Chevalier, and as he had
an Account that I was an Officer in the Irish Brigade, and
had serv'd in Italy, and consequently was an old Soldier;
all this added to the Character which I had before, and
made me have a great deal of Honour paid me, tho' at the
same Time I had no particular Attachment to his Person,
or to his Cause; norjindeed did I much consider the Cause,
of one Side or other, if I had, I should hardly have risqu'd,
not my Life only, but Effects too, which were all, as I
might say, from that Moment, forfeited to the English
Government, and was too evidently in their Power to con-
fiscate at their Pleasure.
However, having just receiv'd a Remittance from
London, of 300 /. Sterling, and sold my Company in the
Irish Regiment for very near as much, I was not only in-
sensibly drawn in, but was perfectly Voluntier in that
dull Cause, and away I went with them at all Hazards;
it belongs very little to my History to give an Account of
that fruitless Expedition, only to tell you, that being so
closely and effectually chas'd by the English Fleet, which
was superior in Force to the French, I may say, that in
escaping them, I escaped being hang'd.
It was the good Fortune of the French, that they over-
shot the Port they aim'd at, and intending for the Frith or
Forth, or as it is called, the Firth of Edinburgh, the first
Land they made was as far North as a Place call'd Mont-
rose, where it was not their Business to Land, and so they
were oblig'd to come back to the Frith, and were gotten
to the Entrance of it, and came to an Anchor for theTide;
but this Delay or Hinderance gave Time to the English,
under Sir George Bing, to come to the Frith, and they
came to an Anchor, just as we did, only waiting to go up
the Frith with the Flood.
Had we not over-shot the Port, as above, all our Squad-
ron had been destroy'd in two Days, and all we could have
done, had been to have gotten into the Peer or Haven at
Leith, with the smaller Frigates, and have landed the
Troops and Ammunition; but we must have set Fire to
the Men of War, for the English Squadron was not above
24 Hours behind us, or thereabout.
Upon this Surprize, the French Admiral set sail from
the North Point of the Firth, where we lay, and crowding
away to the North, got the Start of the English Fleet, and
made their Escape, with the Loss of one Ship only, which
being behind the rest, could not get away; when we were
satisfied the English left chasing us, which was not till the
third Night, when we alter'd our Course, and lost Sight
of them, we stood over to the Coast of Norway, and keep-
ing that Shore on Board all the Way to the Mouth of the
Baltick, we came to an Anchor again, and sent two Scouts
Abroad to learn News, to see if the Sea was clear, and
being satisfied that the Enemy did not chase us, we kept
on with an easier Sail, and came all back again to Dun-
kirk, and glad I was to set my Foot on Shore again; for all
the while we were thus flying for our Lives, I was under
the greatest Terror imaginable, and nothing but Halters
and Gibbets run in my Head, concluding, that if I had
been taken, I should certainly have been hang'd.
But the Care was now over, I took my Leave of the
Chevalier, and of the Army, and made haste to Paris: I
came so unexpectedly to Paris, and to my own Lodgings,
that it was my Misfortune to make a Discovery, relating
to my Wife, which was not at all to my Satisfaction; for I
found her Ladyship had kept some Company, that I had
Reason to believe were not such as an honest Woman
ought to have convers'd with, and as I knew her Temper,
by what I had found of her myself, I grew very jealous
and uneasy about her; I must own it touch'd me very near-
ly, for I began to have an extraordinary Value for her, and
her Behaviour was very taking, especially after I had
brought her into France; but having a Vein of Levity, it
was impossible to prevent her running into such Things,
in a Town, so full of what they call Gallantry as Paris.
vol. ii e
It vext me also to think that it should be my Fate to be
a Cuckold, both Abroad and at Home, and sometimes I
would be in such a Rage about it, that I had no Govern-
ment of myself, when I thought of it; whole Days, and I
ay say sometimes whole Nights, I spent musing and
considering what I should do to her, and especially what
I should do to the Villain, wherever he was, that had thus
abus'd and supplanted me: Here indeed I committed
Murder more than once, or indeed than a hundred Times,
in my Imagination, and as the Devil is certainly an appa-
rent Prompter to Wickedness, if he is not the first Mover
of it in our Minds; he teiz'd me Night and Day with Pro-
posals to kill my Wife.
This horrid Project he carried up so high, by raising
fierce Thoughts, and fomenting the Blood upon my Con-
templation of the Word Cuckold, that in short, I left de-
bating whether I should Murder her or no, as a Thing out
of the Question, and determined; and my Thoughts were
then taken up only with the Management how I should
kill her, and how to make my Escape after I had done it.
All this while I had no sufficient Evidence of her Guilt,
neither had I so much as charg'd her with it, or let her
know I suspected her, otherwise than as she might per-
ceive it in my Conduct, and in the Change of my Behavi-
our to her, which was such, that she could not but per-
ceive that something troubled me, yet she took no Notice
of it to me, but receiv'd me very well, and shew'd herself
to be glad of my Return; nor did I find she had been ex-
travagant in her Expences while I was Abroad; but
Jealousy, as the wise Man says, is the Wrath of a Man; her
being so good a Hussy of what Money I had left her,
gave my distemper'd Fancy an Opinion that she had been
maintain'd by other People, and so had had no Occasion
to spend.
I must confess, she had a difficult Point here upon her,
tho' she had been really honest; for as my Head was pre-
possess'd of her Dishonesty, if she had been lavish, I
should have said, she had spent it upon her Gentlemen;
and as she had been frugal, I said, she had been main-
tain'd by them: Thus, I say, my Head was distemper'd, I
believ'd myself abus'd, and nothing could put it out of
my Thoughts Night or Day.
All this while, it was not visibly broken out between
us, but I was so fully possess'd with the Belief of it, that
I seem'd to want no Evidence, and I look'd with an evil
Eye upon every Body that came near her, or that she con-
vers'd with: There was an Officer of the Guards du Corps;
that lodg'd in the same House with us, a very honest
Gentleman, and a Man of Quality; I happen'd to be in a
little Drawing-Room, adjoining to a Parlour where my
Wife sat at that Time, and this Gentleman came into the
Parlour, which, as he was one of the Family, he might
have done without Offence, but he not knowing that I
was in the Drawing-Room, sat down and talk'd with my
Wife; I heard every Word they said, for the Door be-
tween us was open, nor could I say that there pass'd any
Thing between them, but cursory Discourse; they talk'd
of casual Things, of a young Lady, a Burgher's Daughter
of Nineteen, that had been Married the Week before to
an Advocate in the Parliament of Paris, vastly Rich, and
about 63; and of another, a Widow Lady of Fortune in
Paris, that had married her deceas'd Husband's Valet de
Chambre, and of such casual Matters, that I could find
no Fault with her now at all.
But it fill'd my Head with jealous Thoughts, and fir'd
my Temper: Now I fancy'd he us'd too much Freedom
with her, then that she us'd too much Freedom to him,
and once or twice I was upon the Point of breaking in up-
on them, and affronting them both, but I restrain'd my-
self; at length he talk'd something merrily of the Lady
throwing away her Maidenhead, as I understood it, upon
an old Man; but still it was nothing indecent; but I, who
was all on Fire already, could bear it no longer, but start-
ed up, and came into the Room, and catching at my Wife's
Words, Say you so, Madam, said I, was he too oldfor her?
And giving the Officer a Look, that I fancy was some-
thing a-kin to the Face on the Sign, call'd the Bull and
Mouth within Aldersgate, I went out into the Street.
The Marquis, so he was stil'd, a Man of Honour, and
of Spirit too, took it as I meant it, and follow'd me in a
Moment, and hem'd after me in the Street; upon which I
stopp'd, and he came up to me, Sir, said he, our Circum-
slances are very unhappy in France, that we cannot do our-
selves Juslice here, without the most severe Treatment in the
World; but come on it what will, you musl explain yourself to
me on the Subjecl of your Behaviourjusl now.
I was a little cool'd, as to the Point of my Conduct to
him in the very few Moments that had pass'd, and was
very sensible, that I was wrong to him, and I said there-
fore to him very frankly, Sir, you are a Gentleman, who I
know very well, and I have a very great Respect for you;
but I had been disturb'd a little about the Conduct of my
Wife, and were it your own Case, what would you have
done less?
I am sorry for any Dislike between you, and your Wife,
says he, but what is that to me? Can you charge me with
any Indecency to her, except my talking so and so, at
which he repeated the Words, and as I knew you were in
the next Room, and heard every Word, and that all the
Doors were open, I thought no Man could have taken
amiss so innocent an Expression.
I could no otherwise take it amiss, said I, than as I
thought it imply'd a farther Familiarity, and that you can-
not expect should be born by any Man of Honour; how-
ever, Sir, said I, I spoke only to my Wife, I said nothing
to you, but gave you my Hat as I pass'd you.
Yes, said he, and a Look as full of Rage as the Devil,
Are there no Words in such Looks?
I can say nothing to that, said I, for I cannot see my
own Countenance; but my Rage, as you call it, was at my
Wife, not at you.
But hark you Sir, said he, (growing warm as I grow
calm) your Anger at your Wife was for her Discourse
with me, and I think that concerns me too, and I ought to
resent it.
I think not Sir, said I, nor had I found you in Bed with
my Wife, would I have quarrel'd with you; for if my Wife
will let you lie with her, 'tis she is the Offender, what
have I to do with you? You could not lie with her if she
was not willing, and if she is willing to be a Whore, I
ought to punish her; but I should have no Quarrel with
you, I'll lie with your Wife if I can, and then I'm even
with you.
I spoke this all in good Humour, and in order to pacify
him, but it would not do; but he would have me give him
Satisfaction, as he call'd it, I told him I was a Stranger in
the Country, and perhaps should find little Mercy in
their Course of Justice; that it was not my Business to
fight any Man in his vindicating his keeping Company
with my Wife, for that the Injury was mine, in having a
bad Woman to deal with; that there was no Reason in the
Thing, that after any Man should have found the Way
into my Bed, I, who am injur'd, should go and stake my
Life upon an equal Hazard against the Men who have
abus'd me.
Nothing would prevail with this Person to be quiet for
all this; but I had affronted him, and no Satisfaction could
be made him, but that at the Point of the Sword; so we
agreed to go away together to Lisle in Flanders: I was
now Soldier enough not to be afraid to look a Man in the
Face, and as the Rage at my Wife inspir'd me with Cou-
rage, so he let fall a Word that fir'd and provok'd me be-
yond all Patience; for speaking of the Distrust I had of
my Wife, he said unless I had good Information, I ought
not to suspect my Wife: I told him, if I had good Informa-
tion, I should be past Suspicion; he replied, if he was
the happy Man that had so much of her Favour, he
would take Care then to put me past the Suspicion; I
gave him as rough an Answer as he could desire, and he
return'd in French, Nous Verrons aux Lisle, that is to say,
We will talk further of it at Lisle.
I told him, I did not see the Benefit either to himor me,
of going so far as Lisle to decide this Quarrel, since now I
perceiv'd he was the Man I wanted, that we might decide
this Quarrel aux Champ, upon the Spot, and whoever had
the Fortune to fell the other, might make his Escape to
Lisle, as well afterwards as before.
Thus we walk'd on, talking very ill-naturedly on both
Sides, and yet very mannerly, till we came clear of the
Subards of Paris, on the Way so Charenton; when seeing
the Way clear, I told him under those Trees was a very
fit Place for us, pointing to a Row of Trees adjoining to
Monsieur 's Garden Wall; so we went thither,
and fell to Work immediately, after some Fencing he
made a home Thrust at me, and run me into my Arm, a
long slaunting Wound, but at the same Time receiv'd
my Point into his Body, and soon after fell; he spoke some
Words before he dropp'd; first he told me I had kill'd
him, than he said, he had indeed wrong'd me, and as he
knew it, he ought not to have fought me; he desir'd I
would make my Escape immediately, which I did into
the City, but no farther, no Body as I thought having
seen us together: In the Afternoon, about six Hours after
the Action, Messengers brought News, one on the Heels
of another, that the Marquis was mortally wounded, and
carried into a House at Charenton; that Account, saying
he was not dead, surprized me a little, not doubting, but
that concluding I had made my Escape, he would own
who it was; however, I discovered nothing of my Con-
cern, but going up into my Chamber, I took out of a Cabi-
net there what Money I had, which indeed was so much
as I thought would be sufficient for my Expences; but
having an accepted Bill for 2000 Livres, I walk'd sedate-
ly to a Merchant who knew me, and got 50 Pistoles of
him upon my Bill, letting him know my Business call'd
me to England, and I would take the rest of him when he
had receiv'd it.
Having furnish'd myself thus, I provided me a Horse
for my Servant, for I had one very good one of my own,
and once more ventured Home to my Lodging, where I
heard again that the Marquis was not dead: My Wife all
this while cover'd her Concern for the Marquis so well,
that she gave me no Room to make any Remark upon
her; but she saw evidently the Marks of Rage and deep
Resentment in my Behaviour after some little Stay, and
perceiving me making Preparations for a Journey, she
said to me, Are you going out of Town? Yes Madam, say
I, that you may have Room to mourn for your Friend the
Marquis, at which she started, and shew'd she was indeed
in a most terrible Fright, and making a thousand Crosses
about herself, and with a great many Callings upon the
blessed Virgin, and her Country Saints, she burst out at
last, is it possible! Are you the Man that kill'd the Mar-
quis? Then you are undone and I too.
You may Madam, be a Loser by the Marquis being
kill'd, but I'll take Care to be as little a Looser by you as I
can; 'tis enough the Marquis has honestly confessed
your Guilt, and I have done with you; she would have
thrown herself into my Arms, protesting her Innocence,
and told me she would fly with me, and would convince
me of her Fidelity, by such Testimonies as I could not be
satisfied with, but I thrust her violently from me, Alle In-
fante! said I, go infamous Creature, and take from me the
Necessity I shou'd be under if I stay'd, of sending you to
keep Company with your dear Friend the Marquis. I
thrust her away with such Force, that she fell backward
upon the Floor, and cried out most terribly, and indeed
she had Reason, for she was very much hurt.
It grieved me indeed to have thrust her away with such
Force, but you must consider me now in the Circumstan-
ces of a Man enrag'd, and as it were out of himself, furi-
ous and mad: However, I took her up from the Floor,
and laid her on the Bed, and calling up her Maid, bid her
go and take Care of her Mistress; and going soon after
out of Doors, I took Horse, and made the best of my Way
not towards Calais or Dunkirk, or towards Flanders, whe-
ther it might be suggested I was fled, and whether they
did pursue me the same Evening; but I took the direct
Road for Lorrain, and riding all Night, and very hard, I
passed the Main the next Day at Night at Chalons, and
came safe into the Duke of Lorrain's Dominions the third
Day, where I rested one Day, only to consider what
Course to take, for it was still a most difficult Thing to
pass any Way, but that I should either be in the King of
France's Dominions, or be taken by the French Allies as a
Subject of France; but getting good Advice from a Priest
at Barle Duc, who, tho' I did not tell him the Particulars
of my Case, yet guessed how it was, it being as he said,
very usual for Gentlemen in my Circumstances to fly that
Way: Upon this Supposition, this kind Padre got me a
Church Pass, that is to say, he made me a Purveyor for
the Abbey of , and as such, got me a Passport to go
to Deux Ponts, which belonged to the King of Sweden.
Having such Authority there, and the Priest's Recom-
mendation to an Ecclesiastick in the Place, I got Pass-
ports from thence in the King of Sweden's Name to Co-
logne, and then I was thoroughly safe, so making my Way
to the Netherlands, without any Difficulty I came to the
Hague, and from thence, tho' very privately, and by seve-
ral Names, I came to England: And thus I got clear of my
Italian Wife, Whore, I should have call'd her, for after I
had made her so myself, how should I expect any other
of her?
Being arriv'd at London, I wrote to my Friend at Paris,
but dated my Letter from the Hague, where I order'd
him to direct his Answers: The chief Business of my
writing was, to know if my Bill was paid him, to enquire
if any Pursuit was made after me, and what other News
he had about me, or my Wife, and particularly how it had
far'd with the Marquis.
I receiv'd an Answer in a few Days, importing that he
had receiv'd the Money on my Bill, which he was ready
to pay as I should direct, that the Marquis was not dead,
but said he, you have kill'd him another Way, for he has
lost his Commission in the Guards, which was worth to
him 20000 Livres, and he is yet a close Prisoner in the
Baslile; that Pursuit was order'd after me, upon Suspi-
cion, that they had followed me to Amiens, on the Road to
Dunkirk, and to Chaslean de Cambresis, on the Way to
Flanders; but missing me that Way, had given it over;
that the Marquis had been too well instructed to own that
he had fought with me, but said, that he was assaulted on
the Road, and unless I could be taken, he would take his
Trial and come off, for want of Proof, that my flying was
a Circumstance indeed that mov'd strongly against him,
because it was known that we had had some Words that
Day, and were seen to walk together; but that nothing
being prov'd on either Side, he would come off with the
Loss of his Commission, which, however, being very
rich, he could bear well enough.
As to my Wife he wrote me Word she was inconsola-
ble, and had cry'd herself to Death almost; but he added,
(very ill-natur'd indeed) and whether it was for me, or
for the Marquis, that he could not determine: He like-
wise told me, she was in very bad Circumstances, and
very low, so that if I did not take some Care of her, she
would come to be in very great Distress.
The latter Part of this Story mov'd me indeed, for I
thought however it was, I ought not to let her starve; and
besides, Poverty was a Temptation which a Woman
could not easily withstand, and I ought not to be the In-
strument to drive her to a horrid Necessity of Crime, if I
could prevent it.
Upon this, I wrote to him again, to go to her, and talk
with her, and learn as much as he could of her particular
Circumstances; and that if he found she was really in
Want, and particularly, that she did not live a scandalous
Life, he should give her 20 Pistoles, and tell her, if she
would engage to live retir'd and honestly, she should have
so much annually, which was enough to subsist her.
She took the first 20 Pistoles, but bad him tell me, that
I had wrong'd her, and unjustly charg'd her, and I ought
to do her Justice; and I had ruin'd her by exposing her in
such a Manner as I had, having no Proof of my Charge, or
Ground for any Suspicion; that as to 20 Pistoles a Year,
it was a mean Allowance, to a Wife that had travelled
over the World, as she had done with me, and the like;
and so expostulated with him to obtain 40 Pistoles a Year
of me, which I consented to; but she never gave me the
Trouble of paying above one Year, for after that, the
Marquis was so fond of her again that he took her away
to himself; and as my Friend wrote me Word, had settled
400 Crowns a Year on her, and I never heard any more
of her.
I was now in London, but was oblig'd to be very retir'd,
and change my Name, letting no Body in the Nation
know who I was, except my Merchant, by whom I corre-
sponded with my People in Virginia, and particularly
that my Tutor, who was now become the Head Manager
of my Affairs, and was in very good Circumstances him-
self also by my Means; but he deserved all I did, or cou'd
do for him; for he was a most faithful Friend as well as
Servant, as ever Man had, in that Country at least.
I was not the easiest Man alive, in the retir'd solitary
manner I now liv'd in; and I experienc'd the Truth of the
Text, That it is not good for Man to be alone, for I was ex-
treamly melancholy and heavy, and indeed knew not
what to do with myself, particularly, because I was under
some Restraint, that I was too afraid to go abroad, at last
I resolv'd to go quite away, and go to Virginia again, and
there live retired as I could.
But when I came to consider that Part more narrowly,
I could not prevail with myself to live a private Life: I
had got a wandring kind of Taste and Knowledge of
Things, begat a Desire of encreasing it, and an exceeding
Delight I had in it, tho' I had nothing to do in the Armies
or in War, and did not design ever to meddle with k
again; yet I could not live in the World, and not enquire
what was doing in it, nor could I think of living in Vir-
ginia, where I was to hear my News twice a Year, and
read the publick Accounts of what was just then upon
the Stocks, as the History of Things past.
This was my Notion, I was now in my Native Country,
where my Circumstances were easy, and tho' I had ill
Luck Abroad, for I brought little Home with me, yet by
little good Management I might soon have Money by
me. I had no Body to keep but myself and my Plantations
in Virginia, generally return'd me from 400 to 600 /. a
Year, one Year above 700 /. and to go thither I concluded,
was to be buried alive; so I put off all Thoughts of it, and
resolv'd to settle somewhere in England, where I might
know every Body, and no Body know me. I was not long
in concluding where to pitch, for as I spoke the French
Tongue perfectly well, having been so many Years among
them, it was easy for me to pass for a Frenchman; so I
went to Canterbury, call'd myself an Englishman among
the French, and a Frenchman among the English; and on
that Score was the more perfectly conceal'd, going by the
Name of Monsieur Charnot, with the French, was call'd
Mr. Charnock among the English.
Here indeed I liv'd perfectly Incog. I made no particu-
lar Acquaintance so as to be intimate, and yet I knew
every Body, and every Body knew me, I discoursed in
common, talk'd French with the Walloons, and English
with the English; and liv'd retir'd and sober, was well
enough receiv'd by all Sorts, but as I meddled with no
Bodies Business, so no Body meddl'd with mine, I thought
I liv'd pretty well.
But I was not fully satisfied, a settled Family Life was
the Thing I lov'd, had made two pushes at it, as you have
heard, but with ill Success; yet the Miscarriage of what
was pass'd did not discourage me at all, but I resolv'd to
marry, I look'd out for a Woman as suitable as I could,
but always found something or other to shock my Fancy;
except once a Gentleman's Daughter of good Fashion,
but I met with so many Repulses of one kind or another,
that I was forc'd to give it over, and indeed, tho' I might
be said to be a Lover in this Suit, and had manag'd myself
so well with the young Lady, that I had no difficulty left,
but what would soon have been adjusted, yet her Father
was so difficult, made so many Objections, was to Day not
pleased, one Way To-morrow another, that he would
stand by nothing that he himself had proposed, nor could
he be ever brought to be of the same Mind two Days to-
gether; so that we at last put an End to the Pretensions,
for she would not marry without her Father's Consent,
and I would not steal her, and so that Affair ended.
I cannot say but I was a little vex'd at the Disappoint-
ment of this, so I left the City of Canterbury, and went to
London in the Stage-Coach; here I had an odd Scene pre-
sented as ever happen'd of its kind.
There was in the Stage-Coach a young Woman and
her Maid, she was sitting in a very melancholly Posture,
for she was in the Coach before me,and sigh'd most dread-
fully all the Way, and whenever her Maid spoke to her,
she burst out into Tears; I was not long in the Coach with
her, but seeing she made such a dismal Figure, I offer'd
to comfort her a little, and enquired into the Occasion of
her Affliction, but she wou'd not speak a Word; but her
Maid with a Force of crying too, said her Master was
dead, at which Word the Lady burst out again into a Pas-
sion of crying, and between Mistress and Maid, this was
all I could get for the Morning part of that Day: When
we came to Dine, I offer'd the Lady, that seeing I sup-
posed, she would not dine with the Company, if she
would please to dine with me, I would dine in a separate
Room, for the rest of the Company were Foreigners:
Her Maid thank'd me in her Mistresses Name, but her
Mistress could eat nothing, and desir'd to be private.
Here however, I had some Discourse with the Maid,
by whom I learn'd that the Lady was Wife to a Captain
of a Ship, who was outward Bound to somewhere in the
Streights, I think it was to Zant and Venice, that being
gone no farther than the Downs, he was taken sick, and
after about i0 Days Illness had died at Deal, that his
Wife hearing of his Sickness, had gone to Deal to see
him, and had come but just Time enough to see him die,
had stay'd there to bury him, and was now coming to
London in a sad disconsolate Condition indeed.
I heartily pitied the young Gentlewoman indeed,
and said some Things to her in the Coach, to let her know
I did so, which she gave no Answer too, but in Civility,
now and then made a Bow, but never gave me the least
Opportunity to see her Face, or so much as to know whe-
ther she had a Face or no, much less to guess what Form
of a Face it was; it was Winter Time, and the Coach put
up at Rochetter, not going thro' in a Day, as was usual in
Summer; and a little before we came to Rochesler, I told
the Lady I understood she had eat nothing to Day, that
such a Course would but make her sick, and doing her
Harm, could do her deceased Husband no Good; and
therefore I entreated her, that as I was a Stranger, and only
offer'd a Civility to her, in order to abate her severely
afflicting herself, she would yield so far to Matters of
Ceremony, let us Sup together as Passengers, for as to
the Strangers, they did not seem to understand the Cus-
tom, or to desire it.
She bow'd, but gave no Answer, only after pressing
her by Arguments, which she could not deny was very
civil and kind; she return'd, she gave me Thanks, but she
could not eat: Well Madam, said I, do but sit down, tho,
you think you cannot eat, perhaps you may eat a Bit; in-
deed you must eat, or you will destroy yourself at this
Rate of Living, and upon the Road too: In a Word you
will be Sick indeed; I argued with her, the Maid put in,
and said, do Madam, pray try to divert yourself a little; I
pressed her again, and she bow'd to me very respectfully,
but still said no, and she could not eat; the Maid con-
tinu'd to importune her, and said, Dear Madam do, the
Gentleman is a civil Gentleman, pray Madam do, and
then turning to me said, my Mistress will Sir I hope, and
seem'd pleased, and indeed was so.
However, I went on to perswade her, and taking no
Notice of what her Maid said, that I was a civil Gentle-
man, I told her, I am a Stranger to you Madam, but if I
thought you were shy of me on anyAccount, as to Civility,
I will send my Supper up to you in your Chamber, and
stay below myself; she bow'd then to me twice, and
look'd up, which was the first Time, and said, she had no
Suspicion of that kind, that my Offer was so civil, that she
was as much ashamed to refuse it, as she should be
^ham'd to accept it, if she was where she was known;
that she thought I was not quite a Stranger to her, for she
had seen me before; that she would accept my Offer, so
far as to sit at Table, because I desir'd it, but she could
not promise me to eat, and that she hop'd I would take
the other as a Constraint upon her, in return to so much
Kindness.
She startled me, when she said she had seen me before,
for I had not the least Knowledge of her, nor did I re-
member so much as to have heard her Name; for I had
ask'd her Name of her Maid, and indeed it made me al-
most repent my Compliment; for it was many Ways es-
sential to me not to be known: However, I could not go
back, and besides, if I was known, it was essentially ne-
cessary to me to know who it was that knew me, and by
what Circumstances; so I went on with my Compliment.
We came to the Inn but just before it was dark, I offer-
ed to hand my Widow out of the Coach, and she could not
decline it, but tho' her Hoods were not then much over
her Face, yet being dark, I could see little of her then, I
waited on her then to the Stair-foot, and led her up the
Inn Stairs to a Dining-Room, which the Master of the
House offer'd to show us, as if for the whole Company:
but she declin'd going in there, and said, she desir'd ra-
ther to go directly to her Chamber, and turning to her
Maid, bad her speak to the Inn-keeper to show her her
Lodging-Room; so I waited on her to the Door, and
took my Leave, telling her I would expect her at Supper.
In order to treat her moderately well, and not extrava-
gantly, for I had no Thoughts of any Thing farther than
Civility, which was the Effectof meer Compassion, for the
Unhappiness of the most truly disconsolate Woman that
I ever met with: I say, in order to treat her handsomely,
but not extravagantly, I provided what the House afford-
ed, which was a couple of Partridges, and a very good
Dish of stew'd Oysters; they brought us up afterward, a
Neats Tongue and a Ham, that was almost cut quite
down, but we eat none of it, for the other was fully enough
for us both, and the Maid made her Supper of the Oysters
we had left, which were enough.
I mention this, because it should appear, I did not
treat her as a Person I was making any Court to, for I had
nothing of that in my Thoughts; but meerly in Pity to
the poor Woman, who I saw in a Circumstance that was
indeed very unhappy.
When I gave her Maid Notice that Supper was ready,
she fetch'd her Mistress, coming in before her with a
Candle in her Hand, and then it was that I saw her Face,
and being in her Disabille, she had no Hoods over her
Eyes, or Black upon her Head, when I was truly surpriz-
ed to see one of the most beautiful Faces upon Earth: I
vol. ii f
saluted her, and led her to the Fire-side, the Table tho'
spread, being too far from the Fire, the Weather being
cold.
She was now something sociable, tho' very grave, and
sigh'd often, on Account of her Circumstances; but she
so handsomely govern'd her Grief, yet so artfully made,
it mingled itself with all her Discourse, that it added ex-
ceedingly to her Behaviour, which was every Way most
exquitely genteel: I had a great deal of Discourse with
her, and upon many Subjects, and by Degrees took her
Name, that is to say, from herself, as I had done before
from her Maid, also the Place where she liv'd, viz. near
Rateliff, or rather Stepney, where I asked her Leave to pay
her a Visit, when she thought fit to admit Company,which
she seem'd to intimate would not be a great while.
It is a Subject too surfeiting to entertain People with
/ the Beauty of a Person they will never see; let it suffice to
tell them she was the most beautiful Creature of her Sex
that I ever saw before or since; and it cannot be wonder'd
if I was charm'd with her, the very first Moment I see her
Face, her Behaviour was likewise a Beauty in itself, and
was so extraordinary, that I cannot say I can describe it.
The next Day she was much more free than she was
the first Night, and I had so much Conversation, as to
enter into Particulars of Things on both Sides, also she
gave me Leave to come and see her House, which how-
ever, I did not do under a Fortnight, or thereabouts,
because I did not know how far she would dispense with
the Ceremony, which it was necessary to keep up at the
beginning of the Mourning.
However I came as a Man that had Business with her,
relating to the Ship her Husband was dead out of, and the
first Time I came was admitted, and in short, the first
Time I came I made Love to her, she receiv'd that Pro-
posal with Disdain, I cannot indeed say she treated me
with any Disrespect, but she said she abhorred the Offer,
and would hear no more of it.
How I came to make such a Proposal to her, I scarce
knew then, tho' it was very much my Intention from the
first.
In the mean Time I enquir'd into her Circumstances
and her Character, and heard nothing but what was very
agreeable of them both; and above all, I found she had
the Report of the best humoured Lady, and the best bred
of all that Part of the Town; and now I thought I had
found what I had so often wish'd for to make me happy,
and had twice miscarried in, and resolv'd not to miss her,
if it was possible to obtain her.
It came indeed a little into my Thoughts, that I was
a married Man, and had a second Wife alive, who tho'
she was false to me, and a Whore, yet I was not legally
divorc'd from her, and that she was my Wife for all that;
but I soon got over that Part, for first, as she was a Whore,
and the Marquis had confessed it to me, I was divorc'd
in Law, and I had a Power to put her away; but having
had the Misfortune of fighting a Duel, and being oblig'd
to quit the Country, I could not claim the legal Process
which was my Right, and therefore might conclude my-
self as much divorc'd as if it had been actually done, and
so that Scruple vanish'd.
I suffer'd now two Months to run without pressing
my Widow any more, only I had kept a strict Watch to
find if any one else pretended to her; at the End of two
Months I visited her again, when I found she receiv'd me
with more Freedom, and we had no more Sighs and Sobs
about the last Husband; and tho' she would not let me
press my former Proposal, so far as I thought I might
have done, yet I found I had Leave to come again, and it
was the Article of Decency which she stood upon as much
as any Thing, that I was not disagreeable to her, and that
my using her so handsomely upon the Road, had given
me a great Advantage in her Favour.
I went on gradually with her, and gave her Leave to
stand off for two Months more; but then I told her the
Matter of Decency, which was but a Ceremony, was not
to stand in Competition with the Matter of Affection;
and in short, I could not bear any longer Delay, but that
if she thought fit we might marry privately, and to cut the
Story short, as I did my Courtship, in about five Months
I got her in the Mind, and we were privately married,
and that with so very exact a Concealment, that her Maid
that was so instrumental in it, yet had no Knowledge of it
for near a Month more.
I was now not only in my Imagination, but in Reality
the most happy Creature in the World, as I was so infi-
nitely satisfied with, my Wife was indeed the best hu-
mour'd Woman in the World, a most accomplish'd beau-
tiful Creature indeed, perfectly well bred, and had not
one ill Quality about her, and this Happiness continu'd
without the least Interruption for about six Year.
But I that was to be the most unhappy Fellow alive in
the Article of Matrimony, had at last a Disappointment
of the worst sort, even here; I had three fine Children by
her, and in her Time of her lying-in with the last, she got
some Cold, that she did not in a long Time get off, and in
short, she grew very sickly: In being so continually ill and
out of Order, she very unhappily got a Habit of drinking
Cordials and hot Liquors, Drink, like the Devil, when it
gets Hold of any one, tho' but a little, it goes on by little
and little to their Destruction; so in my Wife, her Sto-
mach being weak and faint, she first took this Cordial,
then that, till in short she could not live without them,
and from a Drop to a Sup, from a Sup to a Dram, from a
Dram to a Glass, and so on to Two, till at last she took in
short, to what we call Drinking.
As I liken'd Drink to the Devil, in its gradual Posses-
sion of the Habits and Person, so it is yet more like the
Devil in its Encroachment on us, where it gets Hold of
our Senses; in short, my beautiful, good humour'd, mo-
dest, well bred Wife, grew a Beast, a Slave to strong Li-
quor, and would be drunk at her own Table, nay, in her
own Closet by herself, till instead of a well made, fine
Shape, she was as fat as an Hostess; her fine Face bloated
and blotch'd, had not so much as the Ruins of the most
beautiful Person alive, nothing remain'd but a good Eye,
that indeed she held to the last: In short, she lost her
Beauty, her Shape, her Manners, and at last her Virtue;
and giving herself up to Drinking, kill'd herself in about
a Year and half after she first began that cursed Trade, in
which Time she twice was exposed in the most scandal-
ous Manner with a Captain of a Ship, who like a Villain,
took the Advantage of her being in Drink, and not know-
ing what she did; but it had this unhappy Effect, that in-
stead of her being asham'd, and repenting of it when she
came to herself, it harden'd her in the Crime, and she
grew as void of Modesty at last as of Sobriety.
01 the Power of Intemperance! and how it encroaches
on the best Dispositions in the World; how it comes upon
us gradually and insensibly, and what dismal Effects it
works upon our Morals, changing the most virtuous,
regular, well instructed, and well inclined Tempers into
worse than brutal. That was a good Story, whether real
or invented, of the Devil tempting a young Man to mur-
der his Father, No, he said, that was unnatural; why then,
says the Devil, go and lie with your Mother; no, says he,
that's abominable; well then, says the Devil, if you will
do nothing else to oblige me, go and get drunk; ay, ay,
says the Fellow, I'll do that, so he went and made himself
drunk as a Swine, and when he was drunk he murder'd
his Father, and lay with his Mother.
Never was a Woman more virtuous, modest, chaste,
sober, she never so much as desir'd to drink any Thing
strong; it was with the greatest Entreaty that I could pre-
vail with her to drink a Glass or two of Wine, and rarely,
if ever, above one or two at a Time, even in Company she
had no Inclination to it; not an immodest Word ever
came out of her Mouth, nor would she surfer it in any one
else in her hearing,without Resentment and Abhorrence:
But upon that Weakness and Illness after her last Lying-
in as above, the Nurse pressed her whenever she found
herself faint and a sinking of her Spirits, to take this Cor-
dial, and that Dram, to keep up her Spirits, till it became
necessary even to keep her alive, and gradually encreased
to a Habit, so that it was no longer her Physick but her
Food; her Appetite sunk and went quite away, and she
eat little or nothing, but came at last to such a dreadful
Height, that as I have said, she would be drunk in her
own Dressing-Room by ii o'Clock in the Morning, and
in short at last was never sober.
In this Life of hellish Excess, as I have said, she lost all
that was before so valuable in her, and a Villain, if it be
proper to call a Man that was really a Gentleman by such
a Name, who was an intimate Acquaintance coming to
pretend a Visit to her, made her and her Maid so drunk
together, that he lay with them both, with the Mistress
the Maid being in the Room, and with the Maid, the
Mistress being in the Room; after which, he it seems
took the like Liberty with them both as often as he thought
fit, t'ill the Wench being with Child, discover'd it for her-
self and for her Mistress too. Let any one judge what was
my Case now, I that for 6 Years thought myself the hap-
piest Man alive, was now the most miserable distracted
Creature: As to my Wife, I lov'd her so well, and was so
sensible of the Disaster of her drinking, being the Occa-
sion of it all, that I could not resent it to such a Degree as
I had done in her Predecessor, but I pity'd her heartily;
however I put away all her Servants, and almost lock'd
her up, that is to say, I set new People over her, who
would not suffer any one to come near her without my
Knowledge.
But what to do with the Villain that had thus abused
both her and me, that was the Question that remained, to
fight him upon equal Terms, I thought was a little hard,
that after a Man had treated me as he had done, he de-
serv'd no fair Play for his Life, so I resolv'd to wait for
him in Stepney Fields, and which Way he often came
Home pretty late, and Pistol him in the Dark, and if pos-
sible, to let him know what I kill'd him for before I did it:
But when I came to consider of this, it shock'd my Tem-
per too as well as Principle, and I could not be a Murderer
whatever else I could be, or whatever I was provok'd to
be.
«
However I resolv'd on the other Hand, that I would
severely correct him for what he had done, and it was not
long before I had an Opportunity; for hearing one Morn-
ing that he was walking cross the Fields from Stepney to
Shadwell, which Way I knew he often went, I waited for
his coming Home again, and fairly met him.
I had not many Words with him, but told him I had
long look'd for him; that he knew the Villainy he had
been guilty of in my Family, and he could not believe
since he knew also, that I was fully inform'd of it; but
that I must be a great Coward as well as a Cuckold, or
that I would resent it, and that it was now a very proper
Time to call him to an Account for it, and therefore bad
him, if he durst show his Face to what he had done, and
defend the Name of a Captain of a Man of War, as they
said he had been, to draw.
He seem'd surpriz'd at the Thing, and began to parly,
and would lessen the Crime of it, but I told him it was not
a Time to talk that Way, since he could not deny the
Fact; and to lessen the Crime, was to lay it the more upon
the Woman, who, I was sure if he had not first debauch'd
with Wine, he could never have brought to the rest; and
seeing he refused to draw, I knock'd him down with my
Cane at one Blow, and I would not strike him again while
he lay on the Ground, but waited to see him recover a lit-
tle, for I saw plainly he was not kill'd; in a few Minutes
he came to himself again, and then I took him fast by one
Wrist, and can'd him as severely as I was able, and as long
as I could hold it for want of Breath, but forbore his Head,
because I was resolv'd he should feel it; in this Condition
at last he begg'd for Mercy, but I was Deaf to all Pity a
great while, till he roar'd out like a Boy soundly whip'd;
then I took his Sword from him, and broke it before his
Face, and left him on the Ground, giving him two or three
Kicks on the Backside, and bad him go and take the Law
of me, if he thought fit.
I had now as much Satisfaction, as indeed could be
taken of a Coward, and had no more to say to him: But as I
knew it would make a great Noise about the Town, I im-
mediately remov'd my Family, and that I might be per-
fectly conceal'd, went into the North of England, and
liv'd in a little Town call'd , not far from Lancas-
ter, where I liv'd retir'd, and was no more heard of, for
about two Years. My Wife, tho' more confin'd than she
used to be, and so kept up from the lewd Part; which I be-
lieve, in the Intervals of her Intemperance, she was truly
ashamed of, and abhorr'd; yet retain'd the drinking Part,
which becoming, (as I have said) necessary for her Sub-
sistance, she soon ruin'd her Health, and in about a Year
and a half after my Removal into the North, she died.
Thus I was once more a free Man, and as one would
think, should by this Time have been fully satisfy'd that
Matrimony was not appointed to be a State of Felicity to
me.
I should have mention'd, that the Villain of a Captain,
who I had drub'd, (as above) pretended to make a great
Stir about my assaulting him on the Highway, and that I
had fallen upon him with three Ruffians, with an Intent
to murder him, and this began to obtain Belief among the
People in the Neighbourhood: I sent him Word of so
much of it as I had heard, and told him, I hoped it did not
come from his own Mouth, but if it did, I expedited he
would publickly disown it, he himself declaring he knew
it to be false; or else I should be forced to acl: the same
Thing over again, till I had disciplin'd him into better
Manners; and that he might be assured, that if he con-
tinued to pretend that I had any Body with me when I
caned him, I would publish the whole Story in Print, and
besides that, would cane him again wherever I met him,
and as often as I met him, till he thought fit to defend
himself with his Sword like a Gentleman.
He gave me no Answer to this Letter, and the Satis-
faction I had for that was, that I gave twenty or thirty
Copies of it about among the Neighbours, which made it
as publick as if I had printed it, (that is, as to his Acquain-
tance and mine) and made him so hiss'd at, and hated,
that he was obliged to remove into some other part of the
Town, whither, I did not enquire.
My Wife being now dead, I knew not what Course to
take in the World, and I grew so disconsolate and dis-
couraged, that I was next Door to being distemper'd, and
sometimes indeed, I thought myself a little touch'd in my
Head. But it proved nothing but Vapours, and the Vexa-
tion of this Affair, and in about a Year's Time, or there-
abouts, it wore off again.
I had rambled up and down in a most discontented un-
settled Posture after this, I say, about a Year, and then I
considered I had three innocent Children, and I could
take no Care of them, and that I must either go away, and
leave them to the wide World, or settle here, and get
some Body to look after them, and that better a Mother-
in-Law, than no Mother, for to live such a wandering
Life it would not do; so I resolved I would Marry as any
Thing offer'd, tho' it was mean, and the meaner the bet-
ter; I concluded my next Wife should be only taken as an
upper Servant, that is to say, a Nurse to my Children, and
House-keeper to myself, and let her be Whore or honest
Woman, said I, as she likes best, I am resolv'd I won't
much concern myself about that, for I was now one de-
sperate, that valued not how Things went.
In this careless, and indeed, rash foolish Humour, I
talk'd to myself thus; if I marry an honest Woman, my
Children will be taken Care of; if she be a Slut, and abuses
me, as I see every Body does, I'll Kidnap her and send
her to Virginia, to my Plantations there, and there she
shall work hard enough, and fare hard enough to keep
her chaste, I'll warrant her.
I knew well enough at first, that these were mad hare-
brain'd Notions, and I thought no more of being serious
in them, than I thought of being a Man in the Moon:
But I know not how it happen'd to me, I reason'd and
talk'd to myself in this wild Manner so long, that I
brought myself to be seriously desperate; that is, to re-
solve upon another Marriage, with all the Suppositions
of Unhappiness that could be imagined to fall out.
And yet even this rash Resolution of my Senses did
not come presently to Action; for I was half a Year after
this, before I fix'd upon any Thing; at last, as he that
seeks Mischief shall certainly find it, so it was with me,
there happen'd to be a young, or rather a middle aged
Woman in the next Town, which was but half a Mile off,
who usually was at my House, and among my Children
every Day, when the Weather was tolerable; and tho' she
came but meerly as a Neighbour, and to see us, yet she
was always helpful in directing and ordering Things for
them, and mighty handy about them, as well before my
Wife died as after.
Her Father was one that I employed often to go to
Leverpool, and sometimes to Whitehaven, and do Busi-
ness for me; for having, as it were, settled myself in the
Northern Parts of England, I had order'd part of my Ef-
fects to be shipp'd as Occasion of Shipping offered, to
either of those two Towns, to which (the War continuing
very sharp) it was safer coming as to Privateers, than
about thro' the Channel to London.
I took a mighty Fancy at last, that this Girl would an-
swer my End, particularly that I saw she was mighty use-
ful among the Children, so on the other Hand, the Chil-
dren lov'd her very well, and I resolv'd to love her too,
flattering myself mightily, that as I had married two Gen-
tlewomen, and one Citizen, and they prov'd all three
Whores, I should now find what I wanted in an innocent
Country Wench.
I took up a world of Time in considering of this Mat-
ter ; indeed, scarce any of my Matches were done without
very mature Consideration; the second was the worst in
that Article, but in this I thought of it, I believe, four
Months most seriously before I resolv'd, and that very
Prudence spoil'd the whole Thing; however, at last be-
ing resolv'd, I took Mrs. Margaret one. Day as she pass'd
by my Parlour-Door, call'd her in, and told her I wanted
to speak with her; she came readily in, but blush'd
mightily, when I bad her sit down, for I bad her sit down
in a Chair just by me.
I us'd no great Ceremony with her, but told her, that I
had observ'd she had been mighty kind to my Children,
and was very tender to them, and that they all lov'd her,
and that if she and I could agree about it, I intended to
make her their Mother, if she was not engag'd to some
Body else; the Girl sat still, and said never a Word, till I
said those Words, if she was not engag'd to some Body else \
however, I took no Notice of it, other than this, look ye
Moggy, said I, (so they call them in the Country) if you
have promis'd yourself you must tell me; for we all knew
that a young Fellow, a good Clergyman's wicked Son,
had hung about her a great while, two or three Year, and
made Love to her, but could never get the Girl in the
Mind it seems to have him.
She knew I was not ignorant of it, and therefore, after
her first Surprize was over, she told me Mr. had, as
I knew often, come after her, but she had never promis'd
him any Thing, and had for several Years refus'd him;
her Father always telling her that he was a wicked Fellow,
and that he would be her Ruin if she had him.
Well, Moggy, then, says I, what dost say to me, art thou
free to make me a Wife? She blush'd, and look'd down
upon the Ground, and would not speak a good while; but
when I press'd her to tell me, she look'd up, and said, she
suppos'd I was but jesting with her; well, I got over that,
and told her, I was in very good Earnest with her, and I
took her for a sober, honest, modest Girl, and as, I said,
one that my Children lov'd mighty well, and I was in Ear-
nest with her, if she would give me her Consent: I would
give her my Word that I would have her, and we would
be married To-morrow Morning; she look'd up again at
that, and smil'd a little, and said no, that was too soon too
to say yes; she hop'd I would give her some Time to con-
sider of it, and to talk with her Father about it.
I told her she needed not much Time to consider about
it, but however, I would give her till To-morrow Morn-
ing, which was a great while; by this Time I had kiss'd
Moggy two or three Times, and she began to be freer with
me, and when I press'd her to marry me the next Morn-
ing, she laugh'd, and told me it was not lucky to be mar-
ried in her old Cloaths.
I stopp'd her Mouth presently with that, and told her
she should not be married in her old Cloaths, for I would
give her some new; ay, it may be afterwards, says Moggy,
and laugh'd again: No, just now, says I, come along with
me Moggy; so I carried her up Stairs into my Wife's
Room that was, and shew'd her a new Morning Gown of
my Wife's, that she had never worn above two or three
Times, and several other fine Things; look you there
Moggy, says I, there's a Wedding Gown for you, give me
your Hand now that you will have me To-morrow Morn-
ing ; and as to your Father, you know he is gone to Liver-
pool on my Business, but I will answer for it, he shall not be
angry when he comes Home to call his Master Son-in-
Law, and I ask him no Portion; therefore give me thy
Hand for it Moggy, says I, very merrily to her, and kiss'd
her again, and the Girl gave me her Hand, and very plea-
santly too, and I was mightily pleas'd with it, I assure you.
There liv'd about three Doors from us, an antient Gen-
tleman, who pass'd for a Doctor of Physick, but who was
really a Romish Priest in Orders, as there are many in that
Part of the Country, and in the Evening I sent to speak
with him: He knew that I understood his Profession, and
that I had liv'd in Popish Countries, and in a Word, be-
liev'd me a Roman too, for I was such Abroad: When he
came to me, I told him the Occasion for which I sent for
him, and that it was to be To-morrow Morning; he read-
ily told me, if I would come, and see him in the Evening,
and bring Moggy with me, he would marry us in his own
Study, and that it was rather more private to do it in the
Evening, than in the Morning; so I calYd Moggy again to
me, and told her, since she and I had agreed the Matter
for To-morrow, it was as well to be done over Night,
and told her what the Doctor had said.
MOGG2"blush'd again, and said, she must go Home
first, that she could not be ready before To-morrow; look
ye Moggy, says I, you are my Wife now, and you shall never
go away from me a Maid, I know what you mean, you
would go Home to shift you: Come Moggy, says I, come
along with me again up Stairs, so I carried her to a Chest
of Linnen, where was several new Shifts of my last Wife's
which she had never worn at all, and some that had been
worn, there's a clean Smock for you Moggy, says I, and
To-morrow you shall have all the rest: When I had done
this, now Moggy, says I, go and dress you; so I lock'd her
in, and went down Stairs; knock, says I, when you are
dress'd.
After some Time, Moggy did not knock, but down she
came into my Room, compleatly dress'd, for there were
several other Things that I bad her take, and the Cloaths
fitted her as if they had been made for her; it seems she
slipt the Lock back.
Well Moggy, says I, now you see you shan't be marry'd
in your old Cloaths, so I took her in my Arms and kiss'd
her, and well pleased I was, as ever I was in my Life, or
with any Thing I ever did in my Life; as soon as it was
dark, Moggy slip'd away before-hand, as the Doctor and I
had agreed, to the old Gentleman's House-keeper, and I
came in about half an Hour after, and there we were mar-
ry'd in the Doctor's Study, that is to say, in his Oratory,
or Chapel, a little Room within his Study, and we Staid
and supp'd with him afterward.
When after a short Stay more, I went Home first, be-
cause I would send the Children all to Bed, and the other
Servants out of the Way, and Moggy came some Time af-
ter, and so we lay together that Night; the next Morning
I let all the Family know that Moggy was my Wife, and
my three Children were rejoic'd at it to the last Degree:
And now I was a marry'd Man a fourth Time; and in
short, I was really more happy in this plain Country Girl,
than with any of all the Wives I had had: She was not
young, being about 33, but she brought me a Son the
first Year; she was very pretty, well shap'd; and of a merry
chearful Disposition, but not a Beauty; she was an ad-
mirable Family Manager, lov'd my former Children, and
used them not at all the worse for having some of her own,
in a Word, she made me an excellent Wife; but liv'd with
me but four Years, and died of a Hurt she got of a Fall
while she was with Child, and in her I had a very great
Loss indeed.
And yet such was my Fate in Wives, that after all the
Blushing and Backwardness of Mrs. Moggy at first, Mrs.
Moggy had, it seems, made a Slip in her younger Days,
and was got with Child ten Year before, by a Gentleman
of a great Estate in that Country, who promised her Mar-
riage, and afterwards deserted her: But as that had hap-
pen'd long before I came into the Country, and the Child
was dead and forgotten, the People were so good to her,
and so kind to me, that hearing I had marry'd her, no
Body ever spoke of it, neither did I ever hear of it, or sus-
pect it, till after she was in her Grave, and then it was of
small Consequence to me one way or other, and she was a
faithful, virtuous, obliging Wife to me. I had very severe
Affliction indeed, while she lived with me, for the Small-
Pox, a frightful Distemper in that Country, broke into
my Family, and carry'd off three of my Children, and a
Maid-Servant; so that I had only one of my former
Wife's, and one by my Moggy, the first a Son, the last a
Daughter.
While these Things were in Agitation, came on the
Invasion of the Scots, and the Fight at Preslon, and I have
Cause to bless the Memory of my Moggy, for I was all on
Fire on that Side, and just going away with Horse and
Arms, to join the Lord Derwentwater; but Moggy begg'd
me off, (as I may call it) and hung about me so, with her
Tears and Importunities, that I sat still and look'd on,
for which I had Reason to be thankful.
I was really a sorrowful Father, and the Loss of my
Children stuck close to me, but the Loss of my Wife stuck
closer to me than all the rest, nor was my Grief lessen'd,
or my kindest Thoughts abated in the least, by the Ac-
count I heard of her former Miscarriages, seeing they
were so long before I knew her, and were not discover'd
by me, or to me, in her Life-time.
All these Things put together made me very comfort-
less : And now I thought Heaven summon'd me to retire
to Virginia, the Place, and (as I may say) the only Place I
had been bless'd at, or had met with any Thing that de-
serv'd the Name of Success in, and where indeed, my Af-
fairs being in good Hands, the Plantations were increas'd
to such a Degree, that some Years my Return here made
up eight Hundred Pound, and one Year almost a Thou-
sand ; so I resolv'd to leave my native Country once more,
and taking my Son with me, and leaving Moggy's Daugh-
ter with her Grandfather,I made him my principal Agent,
left him considerable in his Hands, for the Maintenance
VOl. II g
of the Child, and left my Will in his Hand, by which, if I
died before I should otherwise provide for her, I left her
2000 /. Portion, to be paid by my Son out of the Estate
I had in Virginia, and the whole Estate if he died un-
married.
I embark'd for Virginia, in the Year , at the Town
of Liverpool, and had a tollerable Voyage thither, only
that we met with a Pyrate Ship, in the Latitude of 48 De-
grees, who plunder'd us of every Thing they could come
at that was for their Turn, that is to say, Provisions, Am-
munition, small Arms and Money; but to give the Ro-
gues their due, tho' they were the most abandon'd Wret-
ches that were ever seen, they did not use us ill; and as to
my Loss, it was not considerable, the Cargo which I had
on Board, was in Goods, and was of no Use to them; nor
could they come at those Things without rumaging the
whole Ship, which they did not think worth their while.
I found all my Affairs in very good Order at Virginia,
my Plantations prodigiously increas'd, and my Manager
who first inspired me with travelling Thoughts, and
made me Master of any Knowledge worth naming, re-
ceiv'd me with a Transport of Joy, after a Ramble of four
and twenty Years.
I ought to remember it to the Encouragement of all
faithful Servants, that he gave me an Account, which I
believe was critically Just, of the whole Affair of the Plan-
tations, each by themselves, and ballanc'd in Years, every
Year's Produce being fully transmitted, Charges deduct-
ed, to my Order at London.
I was exceedingly satisfied, as I had good Reason in-
deed with his Management, and with his Management,
as much in its Degree of his own, I can safely say it: He
had improv'd a very large Plantation of his own at the
same Time, which he began upon the Foot of the Coun-
try's Allowance of Land, and the Encouragement he had
from me.;
When he had given me all this pleasing agreeable Ac-
count, you will not think it strange, that I had a Desire to
see the Plantations, and to view all the Servants, which in
both the Works were upwards of three Hundred; and as
my Tutor generally bought some every Fleet that came
from England, I had the Mortification to see two or three
of the Predion Gentlemen there, who being Prisoners of
War, were spar'd from the publick Execution, and sent
over for to that Slavery, which to Gentlemen must be
worse than Death.
I do not mention what I did or said, relating to them
here, I shall speak at large of it, when the rest of them
came over, which more nearly concern'd me.
BuTone Circumstance occurr'd to mehere, that equal-
ly surpriz'd me, and terrify'd me to the last Degree; look-
ing over all the Servants, as I say above, and viewing the
Plantations narrowly and frequently, I came one Day by
a Place where some Women were at Work by themselves:
I was seriously reflecting on the Misery of human Life,
when I saw some of those poor Wretches; thought I,they
have perhaps liv'd gay, and pleasantly in the World, not-
withstanding, thro' a Variety of Distresses, they may
have been brought to this; and if a Body was to hear the
History of some of them now, itwould perhaps be as mov-
ing, and as seasonable a Sermon as any Minister in the
Country could Preach.
Wh1le I was musing thus, and looking at the Women,
on a sudden I heard a Combustion among other of the
Women Servants, who were almost behind me in the
same Work, and Help was call'd loudly for, one of the
Women having swoon'd away; they said she would die
immediately if something was not done to relieve her; I
had nothing about me, but a little Bottle,which we always
carried about us there with Rum, to give any Servant a
Dram that merited that Favour; so I turn'd my Horse,
and went up towards the Place; but as the poor Creature
was lying flat on the Ground, and the rest of the Women
Servants about her, I did not see her, but gave them the
Bottle, and they rub'd her Temples with it, and with
much a-do brought her to Life, and gave her a little to
drink, but she could drink none of it, and was exceeding
ill afterwards, so that she was carried to the Infirmary, so
they call it in the Religious Houses in Italy, where the sick
Nuns or Friers are carried; but here in Virginia, I think
they should call it the Condemn'd-hole, for it really was
only a Place just fit for People to die in, not a Place to be
cur'd in.
The sick Woman refusing to drink, one of the Women
Servants brought me the Bottle again, and I bad them
drink it among them,which had almost set them together
by the Ears for the Liquor, there being not enough to
give every one a Sup.
I went Home to my House immediately, and reflect-
ing on the miserable Provision was wont to be made for
poor Servants, when they were sick, I enquir'd of my
Manager, if it was so still? He said, he believ'd mine was
better than any in the Country; but he confess'd it was
but sad Lodging; however, he said, he would go and look
after it immediately, and see how it was.
He came to me again about an Hour after, and told me
the Woman was very ill, and frighted with her Condi-
tion, that she seem'd to be very Penitent, for someThings
in her past Life, which lay heavy upon her Mind, believ-
ing she should die; that she ask'd him, if there was no
Ministers to comfort poor dying Servants? And he told
her, that she knew they had no Minister nearer than such
a Place; but that if she liv'd till Morning, he should be
sent for. He told me also, that he had remov'd her into a
Room where their chief Workman us'd to Lodge; that
he had given her a Pair of Sheets, and every Thing he
could, that he thought she wanted, and had appointed
another Woman Servant to tend her, and sit up with her.
Well, says I, that's well, for I cannot bear to have poor
Creatures lie and perish, by the meer Hardship of the
Place they are in, when they are Sick, and want Help:
Besides, said I, some of those unfortunate Creatures, they
call Convicts, may be People that have been tenderly
brought up. Really Sir, says he, this poor Creature I al-
ways said had something of a Gentlewoman in her, I
could see it by her Behaviour, and I have heard the other
Women say, that she liv'd very great once, and that she
had fifteen Hundred Pound to her Portion, and I dare say
she has been a handsome Woman in her Time, and she
has a Hand as fine as a Ladies now, tho' it be tanned with
the Weather; I dare say she was never brought up to La-
bour as she does here, and she says to the rest that it will
kill her.
Truly, says I, it may be so, and that may be the Reason
that she faints under it; and, I added, is there nothing you
can put her to within Doors, that may not be so Labori-
ous, and expose her to so much Heat and Cold; he told
me yes, there was; he could set her to be the House-
keeper, for the Woman that lately was such, was out of
her Time, and was married and turn'd Planter. Why then
let her have it, said I, if she recovers, and in the mean
Time go, said I, and tell her so, perhaps the Comfort of it
may help to restore her.
He did so, and with that, taking good Care of her, and
giving her good warm Diet, the Woman recover'd, and
in a little Time was Abroad again; for it was the meer
Weight of Labour, and being expos'd to hard Lodging,
and mean Diet, to one so tenderly bred, that struck her,
and she fainted at her Work.
When she was made House-keeper, she was quite an-
other Body; she put all the Houshold into such excellent
Order, and manag'd their Provisions so well, that my Tu-
tor admir'd her Conduct, and would be every now and
then speaking of her to me, that she was an excellent Man-
ager; I'll warrant, says he, she has been bred a Gentle-
woman, and she has been a fine Woman in her Time too:
In a Word, he said so many good Things of her, that I
had a Mind to see her; so one Day I took Occasion to go
to the Plantation-House, as they call'd it, and into a Par-
lour, always reserv'd for the Master of the Plantation;
there she had Opportunity to see me before I could see
her, and as soon as she had seen me, she knew me; but in-
deed, had I seen her an hundred Times, I should not have
known her; she was, it seems, in the greatest Confusion
and Surprize at seeing who I was, that it was possible for
any one to be; and when I order'd my Manager to bring
her into the Room, he found her crying, and begg'd him
to excuse her, that she was frighted, and should die away,
if she came near me.
I not imagining any Thing, but that the poor Creature
was afraid of me, (for Maslers in Virginia are terrible
Things) bad him tell her she need to be under no Con-
cern at my calling for her, for it was not for any Hurt, nor
for any Displeasure, but that I had some Orders to give
her; so having, as he thought, encourag'd her, (tho' her
Surprize was of another Kind) he brought her in; when
she came in, she held a Handkerchief in her Hand, wip-
ing her Eyes, as if she had cry'd, Mrs. House-keeper,
said I, (speaking chearfully to her) don't be concern'd at
my sending for you, I have had a very good Account of
your Management, and I call'd for you, to let you know I
am very well pleas'd with it; and if it falls in my Way to
do you any good, if your Circumstances will allow it, I
may be willing enough to help you out of your Misery.
She made low Curtisies, but said nothing; however,
she was so far encourag'd, that she took her Hand from
her Face, and I saw her Face fully, and I believe she did
it, desiring I should discover who she was, but I really
knew nothing of her any more, than if I had never seen
her in my Life; but went on, as I thought, to encourage
her, as I us'd to do with any that I saw deserv'd it.
In the mean Time my Tutor, who was in the Room,
went out on some Business or other, I know not what; as
soon as he was gone, she burst out into a Passion, and fall
down on her Knees just before me: O I Sir, says she, I see
you don't know me, be merciful to me, I am your miserable di-
vorc'd Wifel
I was astonish'd, I was frighted, I trembled like one in
an Ague, I was speechless; in a Word, I was ready to sink
and she fell flat on her Face, and lay there, as if she had
been dead: I was speechless, I say, as a Stone, I had only
presence of Mind enough to step to the Door, and fasten
it, that my Tutor might not come in: Then going back to
her, I took her up, and spoke comfortably to her, and
told her, I no more knew her, than if I had never seen
her.
O! Sir, said she, Affliclions are dreadful Things, such as I
have suffer'd have been enough to alter my Countenance; but
forgive, said she, for God's Sake the Injuries I have done
you: I have paid dear for all my Wickedness, and 'tis Jusl,
'tis Righteous that God should bring me to your Foot, to ask
your Pardon for all my brutish Doings: Forgive me Sir, said
she, I beseech you, and let me be your Slave or Servant for it
as long as I live, 'tis all I ask: And with those Words, she
fell upon her Knees again, and cry'd so vehemently, that
it was impossible for her to stop it, or to speak a Word
more. I took her up again, made her sit down, desir'd her
to compose herself, and to hear what I was going to say,
tho' indeed it touch'd me so sensibly, I was hardly able to
speak any more than she was.
Fi rst, I told her it was such a Surprize to me, that I was
not able to say much to her, and indeed the Tears ran
down my Face almost as fast as they did on hers, I told her
that I should only tell her now, that as no Body had yet
known any Thing that had pass'd, so it was absolutely
necessary not a Word of it should be known, that it should
not be the worse for her, that she was thus thrown into
my Hands again; but that I could do nothing for her if it
was known, and therefore that her future good, or ill For-
tune, would depend upon her entire concealing it; that as
my Manager would come in again presently, she should
go back to her Part of the House, and go on in the Busi-
ness, as she did before; that I would come to her, and
talke more at large with her in a Day or two; so she retir'd,
after assuring me that not a Word of it should go out of
her Mouth, and indeed she was willing to retire before
my Tutor came again, that he might not see the Agony
she was in.
I was so perplex'd about this surprizing Incident, that
I hardly knew what I did or said all that Night, nor was I
come to any settled Resolution in the Morning, what
Course to take in it: However, in that Morning I call'd
my Tutor, and told him that I had been exceedingly con-
cern'd about the poor distress'd Creature, the House-
keeper; that I had heard some of her Story, which was
very dismal; that she had been in very good Circumstan-
ces, and was bred very well, and that I was glad he had re-
mov'd her out of the Field into the House; but still she
was almost naked, and that I would have him go to the
Warehouse and give her some Linnen, especially Head-
Cloaths, and all Sorts of small Things, such as Hoods,
Gloves, Stockings, Shoes, Petticoats, etc. and to let her
chuse for herself; also a Morning-Gown of Callicoe, and
a Mantua of a better kind of Callicoe; that is to say, to
new Cloath her, which he did: But brought me Word, that
he found her all in Tears, and that she had cry'd all Night
long, and in short, he believ'd she would indeed cry her-
self to Death; that all the while she was receiving the
Things he gave her, she cry'd; that now and then she
would struggle with, and stop it, but that then upon an-
other Word speaking, she would burst out again, so that
it griev'd every Body that saw her.
I was really affected with her Case very much, but
struggled hard with myself to hide it, and turn'd the Dis-
course to something else; in the mean Time, tho' I did
not go to her the next Day, nor till the third Day, yet I
studied Day and Night how to act, and what I should do
in this remarkable Case.
When I came to the House, which was the third Day,
she came into the Room I was in, cloath'd all over with
my Things which I had ordered her, and told me, She
thank'd God she was now my Servant again, and wore my
Livery, thank'd me for the Cloaths I had sent her, and said it
was much more than she had deserv'dfrom me.
I then entered into Discourses with her, no Body be-
ing present but ourselves, and first I told her, She should
name no more of the unkind Things had had past; for she
had humbled herself more than enough on that Subject,
and I would never reproach her with any Thing that was
past, I found that she had been the deepest Sufferer by
far; I told her it was impossible for me, in my present
Circumstances, to receive her there as a Wife, who came
over as a Convict, neither did she know so little as to de-
sire it: But, I told her, I might be instrumental to put an
End to her Misfortunes in the World, and especially to
the miserable Part of it, which was her present Load, pro-
vided she could effectually keep her own Council, and
never let the Particulars come out of her Mouth, and that
from the Day she did, she might date her irrecoverable
Ruin.
She was as sensible of the Necessity of that Part, as I
was, and told me all she could claim of me, would be only
to deliver her from her present Calamity, that she was not
able to support; and that then, if I pleased, she might live
such a Life, as that she might apply the Residue of what
Time she should have, wholly to Repentance; that she
was willing to do the meanest Offices in the World for me;
and tho' she should rejoice to hear that I would forgive
her former Life, yet that she would not look any higher
than to be my Servant, as long as she liv'd; and in the
mean Time, I might be satisfy'd she would never let any
Creature so much as know that I had ever seen her before.
I ask'd her, if she was willing to let me into any Part of
the History of her Life, since she and I parted, but I did
not insist upon it otherwise, than as she thought conveni-
ent; she said, as her Breach with me began first in Folly,
and ended in Sin, so her whole Life afterward was a con-
tinu'd Series of Calamity, Sin and Sorrow, Sin and Shame,
and at last Misery; that she was deluded into gay Com-
pany, and to an expensive Way of Living, which betray'd
her to several wicked Courses to support the Expences of
it; that after a thousand Distresses and Difficulties, being
not able to maintain herself, she was reduced to extreme
Poverty.
That she would many Times have humbled herself to
me in the lowest and most submissive Manner in the
World, being sincerely Penitent for her first Crime, but
that she never could hear of me, nor which Way I was
gone; that she was by that Means so abandon'd, that she
wanted Bread, and those Wants and Distresses brought
her into bad Company of another Kind, and that she fell
in among a Gang of Thieves, with whom she herded for
some Time, and got Money enough a great while, but
under the greatest Dread and Terror imaginable, being
in the constant Fear of coming to Shame, that afterwards,
what she fear'd,was come upon her, and for a very trifling
Attempt, in which she was not Principal, but accidentally
concern'd, she was sent to this Place. She told me, her
Life was such a Collection of various Fortunes, up and
down, in Plenty, and in Misery; in Prison, and at Liber-
ty; at Ease, and in Torment; that it would take up a great
many Days to give me a History of it; that I was come to
see the End of it, as I had seen the best Part of the Begin-
ning; that I knew she was brought up tenderly, and fair'd
delicately; but that now she was with the Prodigal, brought
to desire Husks with Swine, and even to want that Sup-
ply: Her Tears flow'd so strongly upon this Discourse,
that they frequently interrupted her, so that she could not
go on without Difficulty, and at last could not go on at all;
so I told her, I would excuse her telling any more of her
Story at that Time; that I saw it was but a renewing of her
Grief, and that I would rather contribute to her forget-
ting what was past, and desir'd her to say no more of it, so
I broke off that Part.
In the mean Time, I told her, since Providence had
thus cast her upon my Hands again, I would take Care
that she should not want, and that she should not live
hardly neither, tho* I could go no farther at present, and
thus we parted for that Time, and we continu'd in the
Business of House-keeper, only, that to ease her, I gave
her an Assistant, and tho' I would not have it call'd so, it
was neither more nor less than a Servant to wait on her,
and do every Thing for her, and told her too, that it was so.
After she had been some Time in this Place, shere-
cover'd her Spirits, and grew chearful; her fallen Flesh
plump'd up, and the sunk and hollow Parts fill'd again;
so that she began to recover something of that Brightness,
andcharmingCountenance,whichwasonce so very agree-
able to me; and sometimes I could not help having
warm Desires towards her, and of taking her into her first
Station again; but there were many Difficulties occurr'd,
which I could not get over a great while.
But in the mean Time another odd Accident happen'd,
which put me to a very great Difficulty, and more than I
could have thought such a Thing could be capable of; my
Tutor, a Man of Wit and Learning, and full of generous
Principles, who was at first mov'd with Compassion for
the Misery of this Gentlewoman, and even then, thought
there were some Things more than common in her, as I
have hinted: Now, when, as I say, she was recover'd, and
her sprightly Temper restor'd and comforted, he was
charm'd so with her Conversation, that in short, he fell in
Love with her.
I hinted in my former Account of her, that she had a
charming Tongue, was Mistress of abundance of Wit,
that she sung incomparably fine, and was perfectly well
bred, these all remained with her still, and made her a
very agreeable Person; and in short, he came to me one
Evening, and told me, that he came to ask my Leave to
let him marry the House-keeper.
I was exceedingly perplex'd at this Proposal, but how-
ever, I gave him no Room to perceive that; I told him I
hop'd he had consider'd well of it before he brought it so
far as to offer it to me, and supposed that he had agreed
that Point so, that I had no Consent to give, but as she
had almost four Year of her Time to serve.
He answered no, he paid such a Regard to me, that he
would not so much as take one Step in such a Thing with-
out my Knowledge, and assured me, he had not so much
as mentioned it to her. I knew not what Answer indeed to
make to him, but at last I resolv'd to put it off from my-
self to her, because then I should have Opportunity to
talk with her before hand; so I told him he was perfectly
free to act in the Matter as he thought fit; that I could not
say either one Thing or another to it, neither had I any
right to meddle in it; as to her serving out her Time with
me, that was a Trifle, and not worth naming, but I hop'd
he would consider well every Circumstance before he en-
tered upon such an Affair as that.
He told me he had fully consider'd it already, and that
he was resolv'd seeing I was not against it, to have her
whatever came of it, for he believ'd he should be the hap-
piest Man alive with her; then he run on in his Character
of her, how clever a Woman she was in the Management
of all manner of Business, what admirable Conversation
she was, what a Wit, what a Memory, what a vast Share
of Knowledge, and the like; all which I knew to be the
Truth, and yet short of her just Character too; for as she
was all that formerly when she was mine, she was vastly
improv'd in the School of Affliction, and was all the bright
Part, with a vast Addition of Temper, Prudence, Judg-
ment, and all that she formerly wanted.
I had not much Patience, as you may well imagine, till
I saw my honest House-keeper, to communicate this Se-
cret to her, and to see what Course she would steer on so
nice an Occasion; but I was suddenly taken so ill with a
Cold, which held for two Days, that I could not stir out of
Doors; and in thisTime the Matter was all done and over,
for my Tutor had gone the same Night, and made his At-
tack, but was coldly receiv'd at first, which very much
surpriz'd him, for he made no Doubt to have her Consent
at first Word; however, the next Day he came again, and
again the third Day, when finding he was in earnest, and
yet that she could not think of any Thing of that kind, she
told him in few Words, that she thought herself greatly
oblig'd to him for such a Testimony of his Respect to her,
and should have embrac'd it willingly, as any Body would
suppose one in her Circumstances should do, but that she
would not abuse him so much; for that she must acknow-
ledge to him, she was under Obligations that prevented
her, that was in short, that she was a married Woman,
and had a Husband alive.
This was so sincere, but so effectual an Answer, that
he could have no Room to reply one Word to it; but that
he was very sorry, and that it was a very great Affliction
to him, and as great a Disappointment as ever he met
with.
The next Day after he had receiv'd this Repulse, I
cametothePlantation-House,andsendingfortheHouse-
keeper, I began with her, and told her that I understood
she would have a very advantageous Proposal made to
her, and that I would have her consider well of it, and
then told her what my Tutor had said to me.
She immediately fell a crying, at which I seem'd to
wonder very much. O! Sir, says she, how can you name
such a Thing to me? I told her that I could name it the
better to her, because I had been married myself since I
parted from her: Yes Sir, says she, but the Case alters,
the Crime being on my Side, I ought not to marry; but,
says she, that is not the Reason at all, but I cannot do it; I
pretended to press her to it, (tho' not sincerely I must ac-
knowledge, for my Heart had turned toward her for some
Time, and I had fully forgiven her in my Mind all her
former Conduct) but, I say, I seem'd to press her to it, at
which she burst out in a Passion; No, no, says she, let me
be your Slave, rather than the best Man's Wife in the
World: I reasoned with her upon her Circumstances, and
how such a Marriage would restore her to a State of Ease
and Plenty, and none in the World might ever know or
suspect who or what she had been, but she could not bear
it; but with Tears again raising her Voice, that I was
afraid she would be heard. I beseech you, says she, do not
speak of it any more, I was once yours, and I will never
belong to any Man else in the World; let me be as I am,
or any Thing else you please to make me, but not a Wife
to any Man alive but yourself.
I was so mov'd with the Passion she was in at speaking
this, that I knew not what I said or did for some Time; at
length I said to her, it is a great Pity you had not long ago
been as sincere as you are now, it had been better for us
both, however, as it is, you shall not be forced to any
Thing against your Mind, nor shall you be the worse
treated for refusing; but how will you put him off? No
doubt he experts you will receive his Proposal, as an Ad-
vantage, and as he sees no farther into your Circumstan-
ces, so it is. O! Sir, says she, I have done all that already,
he has his Answer, and is fully satisfied, he will never
trouble you any more on that Head, and then she told me
what Answer she had given him.
From that Minute I resolv'd that I would certainly
take her again to be my Wife as before, I thought she had
fully made me Amends for her former ill Conduct, and
she deserv'd to be forgiven; and so indeed she did, if ever
Woman did, considering also what dreadful Penance she
had undergone, and how long she had liv'd in Misery and
Distress; and that Providence had, as it were, cast her up-
on me again, and above all, had given her such an Affec-
tion to me, and so resolv'd a Mind, that she could refuse
so handsome an Offer of Deliverance, rather than be far-
ther separated from me.
As I resolved this in my Mind, so I thought it was
cruel to conceal it any longer from her; nor indeed could
I contain myself any longer, but I took her in my Arms;
well says I, you have given me such a Testimony of Af-
fection in this, that I can no longer withstand, I forgive
you all that ever was between us on this Account, and
since you will be no Body's but mine, you shall be mine
again as you were at first.
But this was too much for her the other Way, and now
she was so far over-come with my yielding to her, that had
she not got vent to her Passion, by the most vehement
crying, she must have died in my Arms, and I was forc'd
to let her go, and set her down in a Chair, where she cry'd
for a Quarter of an Hour before she could speak a Word.
When she was come to herself enough to talk again, I
told her we must consider of a Method how to bring this
to pass; and that it must not be done by publishing there
that she was my Wife before, for that would expose us
both, but that I would openly marry her again; this she
agreed was very rational, and accordingly about two
Months after we were married again, and no Man in the
World ever enjoy'd a better Wife, or liv'd more happy
than we did both for several Years after.
And now I began to think my Fortunes were settled
for this World, and I had nothing before me but to finish
a Life of infinite Variety, such as mine had been, with a
comfortable Retreat, being both made wiser by our Suf-
ferings and Difficulties, and able to judge for ourselves
what kind of Life would be best adapted to our present
Circumstances, and in what Station we might look upon
ourselves to be most compleatly happy.
But Man is a short sighted Creature at best, and in no-
vol. ii h
thing more than in that of fixing his own Felicity, or, as
we may say, choosing for himself: One would have
thought, and so my Wife often suggested to me, that the
State of Life that I was now in, was as perfectly calculated
to make a Man compleatly happy, as any private Station
in the World could be: We had an Estate more than suffi-
cient, and daily encreasing, for the supporting any State
or Figure that in that Place we could propose to ourselves,
or even desire to live in: We had every Thing that was
pleasant and agreeable, without the least Mortification
in any Circumstances of it; every sweet Thing, and no
thing to imbitter it; every Good, and no mixture of Evil
with it; nor any Gap open where we could have the least
Apprehensions of any Evil breaking out upon us; nor in-
deed was it easy for either of us in our phlegmatick melan-
choly Notions, to have the least Imagination how any
Thing disastrous could happen to us in the common
Course of Things, unless something should befall us out
of the ordinary Way of Providence, or of its acting in the
World.
But an unseen Mine blew up all this apparent Tran-
quillity at once, and tho' it did not remove my Affairs
there from me, yet it effectually remov'd me from them,
and sent me a wandring into the World again; a Condi-
tion full of Hazards, and always attended with Circum-
stances dangerous to Mankind, while he is left to choose
his own Fortunes, and be guided by his own short sight-
ed Measures.
I must now return to a Circumstance of my History,
which had been past for some Time, and which relates to
my Conduct , while I was last in England.
I ment1on'd how my faithful Wife Moggy, with her
Tears and her Entreaties, had prevail'd with me not to
play the Mad-man, and openly join in the Rebellion with
the late Lord Derwentwater and his Party, when they en-
ter'd Lancashire, and thereby, as I may, saved my Life.
But my Curiosity prevail'd so much at last, that I gave her
the Slip when they came to Preslon, and at least thought I
would go and look at them, and see what they were likely
to come to.
My former Wife's Importunities as above, had indeed
prevail'd upon me from publickly embarking in that En-
terprize, and joining openly with them in Arms; and by
this, as I have observ'd, she sav'd my Life to be sure, be-
cause I had then publickly espoused the Rebellion, and
had been known to have been among them, which might
have been as fatal to me afterwards, tho' I had not been
taken in the Action as if I had.
BuTwhen they advanc'd, and came nearer to us to Pres-
ton, and there appear'd a greater Spirit among the People
in their Favour; my old Doctor, who I mention'd before,
who was a Romish Priest, and had married us, inspir'd me
with new Zeal, and gave me no Rest, till he oblig'd me
with only a good Horse and Arms to join them the Day
before they enter'd Preslon, he himself venturing in the
same Posture with me.
I was not so publick here as to be very well known, at
least by any one that had Knowledge of me in the Coun-
try where I liv'd; and this was indeed my Safety after-
ward, as you will soon hear; but yet I was known too
among the Men, especially among the Scots, with some
of whom I had been acquainted in Foreign Service; with
these I was particularly conversant, and passed for a
French Officer: I talk'd to them of making a select De-
tachment to defend the Pass between Pretton, and the
River and Bridge; upon maintaining which, as I insisted,
depended the Safety of the whole Party.
It was with some Warmth that I spoke of that Affair,
and as I passed among them I say, for a French Officer,
and a Man of Experience, it caused several Debates
among them; but the Hint was not followed, as is well
known, and from that Moment I gave them all up as lost,
and meditating nothing but how to escape from them,
which I effected the Night before they were surrounded
by the Royal Cavalry: I did not do this without great Dif-
ficulty, swimming the River Ribble, at a Place, where tho'
I got well over, yet I could not for a long while get to a
Place where my Horse cou'd Land himself, that is to say,
where the Ground was firm enough for him to take the
Land; however, at length I got on Shore, and riding very
hard, came the next Evening in sight of my own Dwel-
ling, here after lying by in a Wood till theDepth of Night,
I shut my Horse in a little kind of a Gravel Pit, or Marl-
Pit, where I soon cover'd him with Earth for the present,
and marching all alone, I came about two in the Morning
to my House, where my Wife surpriz'd with Joy, and yet
terribly frighted, let me in, and then I took immediate
Measures to secure myself upon whatever Incidentmight
happen, but which as Things were order'd, I had no need
to make use of, for the Rebels being entirely defeated,
and either all killed or taken Prisoners, I was not known
by any Body in the Country to have been among them;
no, nor so much as suspected, and thus I made a narrow
Escape from the most dangerous Action, and most fool-
ishly embark'd in, of any that I had ever been engag'd in
before.
It was very lucky to me that I killed and bury'd my
Horse, for he would have been taken two Days after, and
would to be sure have been known by those who had seen
me upon him at Preslon; but now, as none knew I had
been Abroad, nor any such Circumstance could discover
me, I kept close, and as my Excursion had been short,
and I had not been missed by any of my Neighbours,
if any Body came to speak with me, behold, I was at
Home.
However, I was not thoroughly easy in my Mind, and
secretly wish'd I was in my own Dominions in Virginia, to
which, in a little Time, other Circumstances occurring, I
made Preparations to remove with my whole Family.
I n the mean Time, as above, the Action at Preslon hap-
pen'd, and the miserable People surrender'dtothe King's
Troops, some were Executed for Examples, as in such
Cases is usual, and the Government extending Mercy to
the Multitude, they were kept in Chesler Castle, andother
Places a considerable Time, till they were disposed of,
some one Way, some another, as we shall hear.
SEVERAlHundredsof them after this, wereattheir own
Request Transported, as 'tis vulgarly expressed, to the
Plantations, that is to say, sent to Virginia, and other
British Colonies, to be sold after the usual Mannerof con-
demn'd Criminals, or, as we call them there, Convicts, to
serve a limitted Time in the Country, and then be made
Freemen again; some of these I have spoken of above;
but now to my no little Uneasiness, I found, after I had
been there some Time, two Ships arrived with more of
these People in the same River where all my Plantations
lay.
I no sooner heard of it, but the first Step I took was, to
resolve to let none of them be bought into my Work, or
to any of my Plantations; and this I did, pretending that
I would not make Slaves every Day of unfortunate Gen-
tlemen, who fell into that Condition for their Zeal to their
Party only, and the like: But the true Reason was, that I
expected several of them would know me, and might per-
haps betray me, and make it public, that I was one of the
same sort, but had made my Escape, and so I might be
brought into Trouble; and if I came off with my Life,
might have all my Effects seiz'd on, and be reduc'd to
Misery and Poverty again at once, all which I thought I
had done enough to deserve.
This was a just Caution, but as I found quickly, was
not a sufficient one, as my Circumstances stood for my
Safety; for tho' I bought none of these poor Men my self,
yet several of my Neighbours did, and there was scarce a
Plantation near me but had some of them, more or less
among them; so that in a Word, I could not peep abroad
hardly, but I was in Danger to be seen and known too, by
some or other of them.
I may be allow'd to say, that this was a very uneasy Life
to me, and such, that in short, I found myself utterly un-
able to bear; for I was now reduced from a great Man, a
Magistrate, a Governor, or Master of three Plantations,
and having three or four Hundred Servants at my Com-
mand, to be a poor self condemn'd Rebel, and durst not
shew my Face; and that I might with the same Safety, or
rather more, have skulk'd about in Lancashire where I
was, or gone up to London, and conceal'd myself there till
Things had been over; but now the Danger was come
Home to me, even to my Door, and I expected nothing
but to be inform'd against every Day, be taken up and
sent to England in Irons, and have all my Plantations
seiz'd on, as a forfeited Estate to the Crown.
I HADbut one Hope of Safety to trust to, and that was,
that having been so little a while among them, done no-
thing for them, and passing for a Stranger, they never
knew my Name, but only I was call'd the French Colonel,
or the French Officer, or the French Gentleman, by most,
if not by all the People there; and as for the Doctor that
went with me, he had found Means to escape too, tho'not
the same Way that I did, finding the Cause not like to be
supported, and that the King's Troops were gathering
on all Sides round them like a Cloud.
But toreturn to myself, this was no Satisfaction to me,
and what to do I really knew not; for I was more at a Loss
how to shift in such a distressed Case as this, now it lay so
close to me, than ever I was in any Difficulty of my Life:
The first Thing I did was to come Home, and make a
Confidence of the whole Affair to my Wife; and tho' I did
it generously without Conditions, yet I did not do it with-
out first telling her, how I was now going to put my Life
into her Hands, that she might have it in her Power to
pay me Home, for all that she might think had been hard
in my former Usage of her; and that in short, it would be
in her Power to deliver me up into the Hands of my Ene-
mies, but that I would trust her Generosity, as well as her
renew'd Affection, and put all upon her Fidelity, and
without any more Precaution, I open'd the whole Thing
to her, and particularly, the Danger I was now in.
A fa1thful Counsellor is Life from the Dead, gives
Courage where the Heart is sinking, and raises the Mind
to a proper Use of Means; and such she was to me in-
deed, upon every Step of this Affair, and it was by her
Direction that I took every Step that followed for the ex-
tricating myself out of this Labyrinth.
Come, come my Dear, says she, if this be all, there is no
Room for any such disconsolate doings as your Fears run
you upon; for I was immediately for selling off my Plan-
tations, and all my Stock, and embarking myself forth-
with, and to get to Maderas, or to any Place out of the
King's Dominions.
But my Wife was quite of another Opinion, and en-
couraging me on another Account, proposed two Things,
either my freighting a Sloop with Provisions to the Wen-
Indies, and so taking Passage from thence to London, or
letting her go away directly for England, and endeavour
to obtain the King's Pardon whatever it might cost.
Iinclin'd to the last Proposal, fortho' I was unhappily
prejudic'd in Favour of a wrong Interest, yet I had al-
ways a Secret and right Notion of the Clemency and mer-
ciful Disposition of his Majesty, and had I been in Eng-
land, should I believe, have been easily persuaded to have
thrown myself at his Feet.
But going to England as I was, Circumstances must
have been a publick Action, and I must have made all the
usual Preparations for it, must have appear'd in Publick,
have staid till the Crop was ready, and gone away in
Form and State as usual, or have acted as if something ex-
traordinary was the Matter, and have fill'd the Heads of
the People there with innumerable Suggestions of they
knew not what.
But my Wife made all this easy to me, from her own
Invention; for without acquainting me with any Thing,
she comes merrily to me one Morning before I was up:
My Dear, says she, I am very sorry to hear that you are
not very well this Morning, I have order'd Pennico, that
was a young Negro Girl which I had given her, to make
you a Fire in your Chamber, and pray lie still where you
are a while, till 'tis done; at the same Instant the little
Negroe came in with Wood, and a pair of Bellows, etc. to
kindle the Fire, and my Wife not giving me Timetoreply,
whispers close to my Ear to lie still, and say nothing till
she came up again to me.
I was thoroughly frighted, that you may be sure of and
thought of nothing but of being discover'd, betray'd,
carried to England, hang'd, quarter'd, and all that was
terrible, and my very Heart sunk within me; she per-
ceiv'd my Disorder, and turn'd back, assuring me there
was no Harm, desir'd me to be easy, and she would come
back again presently, and give me Satisfaction in every
particular that I could desire; so I composed myself a
while as well as I could, but it was but a little while that I
could bear it, and I sent Pennico down Stairs to find out
her Mistress, and tell her I was very ill, and must speak
with her immediately, and the Girl was scarce out of the
Room before I jump'd out of Bed and began to dress me,
that I might be ready for all Events.
My Wife was as good as her Word, and was coming
upas the Girl was coming down; I see, says she, you want
Patience, but pray do not want Government of yourself,
but take that Skreen before your face, and go to the Win-
dow, and see if you know any of those Scotchmen that are
in the Yard, for there are seven or eight of them come
about some Business to your Clerk.
I went and look'd through the Screen, and saw the
Faces of them all distinctly, but could make nothing of
them, other than that they were Scotchmen, which was
easy to discern; however it was no Satisfaction to me that
I knew not their Faces, for they might know mine for all
that, according to the old English Proverb, That more
knows Tom Fool, than Tom Fool knows; so I kept close in
my Chamber till I understood they were all gone.
After this, my Wife caused it to be given out in the
House that I was not well, and when this not being well
had lasted three or four Days, I had my Leg wrap'd up in
a great Piece of Flannel, and laid upon a Stool, and there
I was lame of the Gout; and this serv'd for about six
Weeks, when my Wife told me she had given it out,
that my Gout was rather Rheumatick than asettled Gout,
and that I was resolv'd to take one of my own Sloops, and
go to Nevis or Antegua, and use the hot Baths there for my
Cure.
Aixthiswas very well, and I approv'd my Wife's Con-
trivance as admirably good, both to keep me within
Doors eight or ten Weeks at first, and to convey me away
afterwards without any extraordinary Bustle to be made
about it; but still I did not know what it all tended to, and
what the Design of it all was, but my Wife desir'd me to
leave that to her, so I readily did, and she carried it all on
with a Prudence not to be disputed; and after she had
wrapt my Legs in Flannel almost three Months, she came
and told me the Sloop was ready, and all the Goods put
on Board: And now, my Dear, says she, I come to tell you
all the rest of my Design; for added she, I hope you will
not think I am going to kidnap you, and transport you
from Virginia, as other People are transported to it, or
that I am going to get you sent away and leave myself in
Possession of your Estate; but you shall find me the same
faithful Creature, which I should have been if I had been
still your Slave, and not had any Hopes of being your
Wife, and that in all my Scheme which I have laid for
your Safety, in this new Exigence, I have not proposed
your going one Step but where I shall go, and be always
with you, to assist and serve you on all Occasions, and to
take my Portion with you, of what kind soever our Lot
may be.
Tmswas so generous, and so handsome a Declaration
of her Fidelity, and so great a Token too of the Goodness
of her Judgment, in considering of the Things which
were before her, and of what my present Circumstances
called for, that from that Time forward, I gave myself
chearfully up to her Management, without any Hesita-
tion in the least, and in about Ten Days Preparation,
we embark'd in a large Sloop of my own of about 60
Tun.
I SHOulDhavemention'd here, that I had still my faith-
ful Tutor (as I called him) at the Head of my Affairs, and
as he knew who to correspond with, and how to manage
the Correspondence in England, we left all that Part to
him, as I had done before; and I did this with a full Satis-
faction in his Ability as well as in his Integrity, it is true,
he had been a little shagreen'd in that Affair of my Wife,
who, as I hinted before, had married me, after telling
him, in Answer to his Solicitations, that she had a Hus-
band alive.
Now tho' this was litterally true, yet as it was a Secret
not fit to be open'd to him, I was obliged to put him off
with other Reasons, as well as I could, perhaps not much
to the Purpose, and perhaps not much to his Satisfaction;
so that I reckon'd he look'd on himself as not very kindly
used several Ways.
But he began to get over it, and to be easy, especially
at our going away, when he found that the Trust of every
Thing was still left in his Hands, as it was before.
When my Wife had thus communicated every Thing
of the Voyage to me, and we began to be ready to go off,
she came to me one Morning, and with her usual Chear-
fulness told me, she now came to tell me the rest of her
Measures for the compleating my Deliverance, and this
was, that while we made this Trip as she call'd it, to the
hot Springs at Nevis, she would write to a particular
Friend at London, who she could depend upon, to try to
get a Pardon for a Person on Account of the late Rebel-
lion, with all the Circumstances which my Case was at-
tended with, viz. of having acted nothing among them,
but being three Days in the Place, and while we were thus
absent, she did not question but to have an Answer, which
she would direct to come so many Ways, that we would
be sure to have the first of it, as soon as it was possible the
Vessels could go and come; and in the mean Time the
Expence should be very small, for she would have an An-
swer to the grand Question first, Whether it could be ob-
tain'd or no? And then an Account of the Expence of it,
that so I might judge for myself, whether I would part
with the needful Sum or no, before any Money was dis-
bursed on my Account.
Icould not but be throughlysatisfy'dwithher Contriv-
ance in this particular, and I had nothing to add to it, but
that I would not have her limit her Friend so strictly, but
that if he saw the Way clear, and that he was sure to ob-
tain it, he should go through stitch with it, if within the
Expence of two, or three, or four Hundred Pounds, and
that upon Advice of its being practicable, he should have
Bills payable by such a Person on Delivery of the War-
rant for the Thing.
To fortify this, I enclosed in her Packet a Letter to one
of my Correspondents, who I could particularly trust,
with a Credit for the Money, on such and such Condi-
tions ; but the Honesty and Integrity of my Wife's Cor-
respondence was such, as prevented all the Expence, and
yet I had the wish'd for Security as if it had been all paid,
as you shall hear presently.
All these Things being fix'd to our Minds, and all
Things left behind in good Posture of Settlement as
usual, we embark'd together and put to Sea, having the
Opportunity of an English Man of War being on the Coast
in Pursuit of the Pyrates, and who was just then standing
away towards the Gulph of Florida, and told us he would
see us safe as far as New-Providence, or the Bahama Is-
lands.
And now having fair Weather and a pleasant Voyage,
and my Flannels taken off of my Legs, I must hint a little
what Cargo I had with me, for as my Circumstances were
very good in that Country, so I did not go such a Voyage
as this, and with a particular Reserve of Fortunes what-
ever might afterward happen, without a sufficient Cargo
for our Support, and whatever Exigence might happen.
Our Sloop, as I said, was of about 60 or 70 Ton, andas
Tobacco, which is the general Produce of the Country,
was no Merchandize at Nevis, that is to say, for a great
Quantity, so we carried very little, but loaded the Sloop
with Corn, Pease, Meal, and some Barrels of Pork, and
an excellent Cargo it was, most of it being the Produce of
my own Plantation; we took also a considerable Sum of
Money with us in Spanish Gold, which was as above, not
for Trade, but for all Events: I also order'd another Sloop
to be hir'd, and to be sent after me loaden with the same
Goods, as soon as they should have Advice from me that
I was safe arriv'd.
We came to the Latitude of the Island of Antegua,
which was very near to that of Nevis, whether we intend-
ed to go, on the i8th Day after our passing the Capes of
Virginia, but had no sight of the Island, only our Master
said he was sure if he stood the same Course as he then
was, and the Gale held, I say he told me, he was sure he
should make the Island in less than five Hours sail; so he
stood on fair for the Islands: However his Account had
fail'd him, for we held on all the Evening, made no Land,
and likewise all Night, when in the grey of the Morning
we discover'd from the Top-mast Head, a Brigantine,
and a Sloop making Sail after us, at the Distance of about
six Leagues, fair Weather, and the Wind fresh at S. E.
Our Master soon understood what they were, and
came down into the Cabbin to me, to let me know it; I
was much surpriz'd you may be sure at the Danger, but
my poor Wife took me off of all the Concern for myself to
take Care of her, for she was frighted to that Degree, that
I thought we should not have been able to keep Life in
her.
Whi lEwe were thus underthe first Hurry and Surprize
of the Thing, suddenly another Noise from the Deck
call'd us up to look out, and that was Land, Land, the
Master and I, (for by this Time I had gotten out of my
Cabbin) run upon the Deck, and there we saw the State
of our Case very plain; the two Rogues that stood after us,
laid on all the Canvas they could carry, and crowded after
us amain; but at the Distance as I have said, of about six
Leagues, rather more than less, on the other Hand, the
Land discover'd lay about nine Leagues right a Head; so
that if the Pyrates could get of us, so as to sail three Foot
for our two, it was evident they would be up with us be-
fore we could make the Island, if not, we should escape
them and get in; but even then we had no great Hope to
do any more, than to run the Ship ashore to save our Lives,
and so stranding our Vessel, spoil both Sloop and Cargo.
When we were making this Calculation, our Master
came in chearfully, and told me he had crowded on more
Sail, and found the Sloop carried it very well, and that he
did not find the Rogues gain'd much upon us, and that
especially if one of them did not, that was the Sloop he
found he could go away from the Brigantine as he pleas-
ed : Thus we gave them what they call a stern Chase, and
they work'd hard to come up with us till towards Noon,
when on a sudden they both stood away, and gave us
over, to our great Satisfaction you may be sure.
We did not it seems so easily see the Occasion of our
Deliverance, as the Pyrate did, for while we went spoon-
ing away large with the Wind, foroneof the Islands, with
those two Spurs in our Heels, that is, with these two
Thieves at our Sterns: There lay an English Man of War
in the Road of Nevis, which was the other Island from
whence they espy'd the Pyrates, tho' the Land lying be-
tween, we could not see them.
As the Man of War discover'd them, she immediately
slip'd her Cable, and put herself under Sail in Chase of
the Rogues, and they as soon perceiv'd her, and being
Windward, put themselves upon a Wind to escape her;
and thus we were deliver'd, and in about an Hour more,
we knew who was our Deliverer, seeing the Man of War
stretch a Head clear of the Island, and stand directly after
the Pyrates, who now crowded from us as fast as they
crowded after us before, and thus we got safe into Anti-
gua, after the terrible Apprehension we had been in of be-
ing taken; our Apprehensions of being taken now, were
much more than they would have been on Board a loaden
Ship, from, or to London, where the most they ordinarily
do, is to rifle the Ship, take what is valuable and portable,
and let her go; but ours being but a Sloop, and all our
Loading being good Provisions, such as they wanted to
be sure, for their Ships Store; they would certainly have
carried us away, Ship and all, taken out the Cargo and the
Men, and perhaps have set the Sloop on Fire; so that as
to our Cargo of Gold it had been inevitably lost, and we
hurry'd away, no Body knows where, and used as such
barbarous Fellows are wont to use such innocent People
as fall into their Hands.
But we are now out of their Hands, and had the Satis-
faction a few Days after, to hear that the Man of War pur-
su'd them so close, notwithstanding they chang'd their
Course in the Night, that the next Day they were oblig'd
to separate, and shift for themselves; so the Man of War
took one of them, namely, the Brigantine, and carried her
into Jamaica, but the other, viz. the Sloop, made her
Escape.
Be1 ng arriv'd here, we presently dispos'd of our Cargo,
and at a tolerable good Price; and now the Question was,
what I should do next ? I look'd upon myself to be safe
here from the Fears I had been under of being discover'd
as a Rebel, and so indeed I was, but having been now ab-
sent five Months, and having sent the Sloop back with a
Cargo of Rum, and Melasses, such as I knew was want-
ing in my Plantations, I receiv'd the same Vessel back in
return, loaden as at first, with Provisions.
With this Cargo my Wife receiv'd a Packet from Lon-
don, from the Person who she had employ'd, (as above) to
solicit a Pardon, who very honestly wrote to her, that he
would not be so unjust to her Friend, whoever he was, as
to put him to any Expence for a private Solicitation; for
that he was very well assur'd that his Majesty had resolv'd,
from his own native Disposition to Acts of Clemency
and Mercy to his Subjects, to grant a general Pardon,
with some few Exceptions to Persons extraordinary, and
he hoped her Friend was none of the Extraordinary Per-
sons to be excepted.
Tmswas a kind of Life from the Dead to us both, and
it was resolv'd that my Wife should go back in the Sloop
directly to Virginia, where she should wait the good News
from England, and should send me an Account of it as
soon as she receiv'd it.
Accordingly she went back, and came safe with the
Sloop and Cargo to our Plantation, from whence, after
above four Months Expectation, behold! the Sloop came
to me again, but empty, and gutted of all her Cargo, ex-
cept about i00 Sacks of unground Malt, which the Py-
rates (not knowing how to Brew) knew not what to do
with, and so had left in her: However, to my infinite Satis-
faction, there was a Packet of Letters from my Wife,with
another to her from England, as well one from her Friend,
as one from my own Correspondent; both of them inti-
mating, that the King had sign'd an Act of Grace, that is
to say, a general free Pardon, and sent me Copies of the
Act, wherein it was manifest I was fully included.
And here let me hint, that having now, as it were, re-
vol. i1 i
ceiv'dmy Life at the Hands of King GEORGE, and in a
Manner so satifying as it was to me, it made a generous
Convert of me, and I became sincerely given in to the In-
terest of King GEORGE; and this from a Principle of
Gratitude, and a Sense of my Obligation to his Majesty
for my Life; and it has continu'd ever since, and will cer-
tainly remain with me as long as any Sense of Honour,
and of the Debt of Gratitude remains with me: I mention
this to hint how far in such Cases Justice, and Duty to
ourselves commands us; namely, that to those who gra-
ciously give us our Lives, when it is in their Power to take
them away; those Lives are a Debt ever after, and ought
to be set a-part for their Service, and Interest, as long as
any of the Powers of Life remain; for Gratitude is a Debt
that never ceases while the Benefit receiv'd remains; and
if my Prince has given me my Life, I can never pay the
Debt fully, unless such a Circumstance as this should
happen, that the Prince's Life should be in my Power,
and I as generously preserv'd it; and yet neither would
the Obligation be paid then, because the Cases would dif-
fer; thus, that my preserving the Life of my Prince was
my natural Duty, whereas the Prince on his Side (my Life
being forfeited to him) had no Motive but meer Clemen-
cy and Beneficence.
Perhaps this Principle may not please all that read it;
but as I have resolv'd to guide my Actions in Things of
such a Nature, by the Rules of strict Virtue and Principles
of Honour; so I must lay it down as a Rule of Honour,
that a Man having once forfeited his Life to the Justice of
his Prince, and to the Laws of his Country, and receiving
it back as a Bounty from the Grace of his Sovereign,
such a Man can never lift up his Hand again against
that Prince, without a Forfeiture of his Virtue, and an
irreparable Breach of his Honour and Duty, and deserves
no Pardon after it, either from God or Man; but all this
is a Digression, I leave it as a Sketch of the Laws of Hon-
our, printed by the Laws of Nature in the Breast of a Sol-
dier, or a Man of Honour, and which I believe all impar-
tial Persons, who understand what Honour means, will
subscribe to.
But I return now to my present Circumstances; my
Wife was gone, and with her, all my good Fortune, and
Success in Business, seem'd to have forsaken me; and I
had another Scene of Misery to go thro', after I had
thought that all my Misfortunes were over, and at an
End.
My Sloop, as I have told you, arriv'd, but having met
with a Pyrate Rogue, in the Gulph of Florida, they took
her first, then finding her Cargo to be all Eatables, which
they always want, they gutted her of all her Loading, ex-
cept (as I have said) about 100 Sacks of Malt, which they
really knew not what to do with; and which was still
worse, they took away all the Men, except the Master
and two Boys, who they left on Board, just to run the
Vessel into Antegoa, where they said they were bound.
BuTthe mostvaluable Part of my Cargo, viz. a Packet
of Letters from England, those they left, to my inexpres-
sible Comfort and Satisfaction; and particularly, that by
those, I saw my Way open to return to my Wife, and to
my Plantations, from which I promised myself never to
wander any more.
In order to this, I now embark'd myself, and all my
Effects on board the Sloop, resolving to sail directly to
the Capes of Virginia, my Captain beating it up to reach
the Bahama Channel, had not been two Days at Sea, but
we were overtaken with a violent Storm, which drove us
so far upon the Coast of Florida, as that we twice struck
upon the Shore, and had we struck a third Time, we had
been inevitably lost. A Day or two after that, the Storm
abating a little, wekeptthe Sea, but found the Wind blow-
ing so strong against our passing the Gulph, and the Sea
going so high, we could not hold it any longer; so we
were forced to bear away, and make what Shift we could;
in which Distress, the fifth Day after, we made Land, but
found it to be Cape the North West Part of the
Isle of Cuba: Here we found ourselves under a Necessity
to run in under the Land for Shelter, tho' we had not
come to an Anchor, so we had not touch'd the King of
Spain's Territories at all. However, in the Morning, we
were surrounded with five Spanish Barks, or Boats, such
as they call Barco Longos, full of Men; who instantly
boarded us, took us, and carry'd us into the Havana, the
most considerable Port belonging to the Spaniards in
that Part of the World.
HEREthe Sloop was immediately seiz'd, and in Conse-
quence plunder'd, as any one that knows the Spaniards,
especially in that Country, will easilyguess, our Men were
made Prisoners, and sent to the common Goal; and as for
myself, and the Captain, we were carry'd before the Al-
cade Major, or Intendant of the Place, as Criminals.
I spoke Spanish very well, having served under the
King of Spain in Italy, and it stood me in good stead at
this Time; for I so effectually argued the Injusticeof their
Treatment of me, that the Governor, or what I ought to
call him, frankly own'd they ought not to have stopp'd
me, seeing I was in the open Sea, pursuing my Voyage,
and offer'd no Offence to any Body, and had not landed,
or offer'd to land upon any Part of his Catholick Majesty's
Dominions, till I was brought in as a Prisoner.
It was a great Favour, that I could obtain thus much,
but I found it easier to obtain an Acknowledgment that I
had receiv'd Wrong, than to get any Satisfaction for that
Wrong, and much less was there any Hope or Prospect
of Restitution: And I was let know, that I was to wait, till
an Account could be sent to the Viceroy of Mexico, and
Orders could be received back from him, how to act in
the Affair.
I could easily foresee what all this tended to, namely,
to a Confiscation of the Ship and Goods, by the ordinary
Process atthe Place; andthatmy being left to the Decision
of the Viceroy of Mexico, was butapretended Representa-
tion of Things to him from the Corregidore or Judge of
the Place.
However, I had no Remedy, but the old insignificant
Thing, call'd Patience; and this I was better furnish'd
with, because I did not so much value the Loss as I made
them believe I did; my greatest Apprehensions were,
that they would detain me, and keep me as a Prisoner for
Life, and perhaps send me to their Mines in Peru, as they
have done many, and pretended to do to all that come on
Shore in their Dominions, howgreatsoevertheDistresses
may have been which have brought them thither, and
which has been the Reason why others, who have been
forc'd on Shore, have committed all manner of Violence
upon the Spaniards in their turn; resolving, however dear
they sold their Lives, not to fall into their Hands.
But I got better Quarter among them, than that too,
which was (as I have said) much of it owing to my speak-
ing Spanish, and to my telling them how I had fought in
so many Occasions in the Quarrel of his Ctf£&o/*V£ Majesty,
in Italy, and by great good Chance, I had the King of
France's Commission for Lieutenant Colonel, in the Irish
Brigade in my Pocket, where it was mention'd, that the
said Brigade was then serving in the Armies of France,
under the Orders of his Catholick Majesty in Italy.
I fA1l'd not to talk up the Gallantry and personal
Bravery of his Catholick Majesly, on all Occasions, and
particularly in many Battles, where (by the Way) his
MajesTy had never been at all, and in some, where I had
never been myself; but I found I talk'd to People who knew
nothing of the Matter, and so any Thing went down with
them, if it did but praise the King of Spain, and talk big
of the Spanish Cavalry, of which, God knows, there was
not one Regiment in the Army, at least while I was there.
However, this Way of managing myself, obtain'd me
the Liberty of the Place, upon my Parole, that I would
not attempt an Escape; and I obtain'd also, which was a
great Favour, to have 200 Pieces of Eight allow'd me out
of the Sale of my Cargo, for Subsistence, till I could nego-
tiate my Affairs at Mexico; as formy Men,they weremain-
tain'd as Prisoners, at the Publick Charge.
Well, after several Months Solicitation and Attend-
ance, all I could obtain was, the Satisfaction of seeing my
Ship and Cargo confiscated, and my poor Sailors in a fair
Way to be sent to the Mines: The last: I begg'd off, upon
Condition of paying 300 Pieces of Eight for their Ran-
som, and having them set on Shore at Antegoa, and myself
to remain Hostage for the Payment of the said 30oPieces
of Eight, and for 2 00 Pieces of Eight, which I had already
had,^and for 500 Pieces of Eight more for my own Ran-
som, if upon a Return from Mexico, the Sentence of Con-
fiscation, as above, should be confirm'd by the Vice-roy.
These were hard Articles indeed, but I was forced to
submit to them: Nor, as my Circumstances were above
all such Matters as these, as to Substance, did I lay it
much to Heart; the greatest Difficulty that lay in my
Way was, that I knew not how to correspond with my
Friends in any Part of the World, or which Way to sup-
ply myself with Necessaries, or with Money for the Pay-
ment I had agreed to: The Spaniards being so tenacious
of their Ports, that they allowed no Body to come on
Shore, or indeed near the Shore, from any Part of the
World, upon Pain of Seizure and Confiscation, as had
been my Case already.
UpoNthis Difficulty I begantoreason with theCorregi-
dore, and tell him, that he put Things upon us that were
impossible, and that were inconsistent with the Customs
of Nations; that if a Man was a Prisoner at Algiers, they
would allow him to write to his Friends to pay his Ran-
som, and would admit the Person that brought it to come
and go free, as a publick Person, and if they did not, no
Treaty could be carry'd on for the Ransom of a Slave,
nor the Conditions be perform'd when they are agreed
upon.
I BROUGHTit then down to my own Case, and desired to
know, upon Supposition, that I might, within the Time
limited in that Agreement, have the Sums of Money
ready for the Ransom of my Men, and of myself, how I
should obtain to have Notice given me of it? Or, how it
should be brought, seeing the very Persons bringing that
Notice, or afterwards presuming to bring the Money,
might be liable to be seiz'd and confiscated, as I had been,
and the Money itself be taken as a second Prize, without
redeeming the first.
Tho' this was so reasonable a Request, that it could not
be withstood, in point of Argument, yet the Spaniard
shrunk his head into his Shoulders, and said, they had not
Power sufficient to act in such a Case; that the King's
Laws were so severe against the suffering any Strangers
to set their Foot on his Catholick Majesty's Dominions in
America, and they could not dispense with the least Tittle
of them, without a particular Assiento, (as they called it)
from the Consulado, or Chamber of Commerce at Seville;
or, a Command under the Hand and Seal of the Viceroy
of Mexico.
How! Seignior Corregidore (said I) with some Warmth,
and, as it were, with Astonishment, have you not Author-
ity enough to sign a Passport for an Agent, or Ambassa-
dor, to come on Shore here, from any of the King of
Great-Britain's Governors in these Parts, under a white
Flag, or Flag of Truce, to speak with the Governor of
this Place, or with any other Person in the King's Name,
on the Subject of such Business as the Governor may
have to communicate? Why, said I, if you cannot do
that, you cannot act according to the Law of Nations.
He shook his Head, but still said No, he could not do
even so much as that; but here one of the Military Govern-
ors put in and oppos'd him, and they two differ'd warm-
ly; the first insisting that their Orders were deficient in
that Particular; but the other said, that as they were
bound up to them, it could not be in their Power to act
otherwise, and that they were answerable for the ill
Consequences.
Well then, says the Governor to the Corregidore, now
you have kept this Englishman as Hostage for the Ran-
som of the Men, that you have dismiss'd; suppose he
tells you, the Money is ready, either at such, or such, or
such a Place, How shall he bring it hither? You will take
all the People Prisoners that offer to bring it; What must
he do? If you say you will send and fetch it, What Securiy
shall he have, that he shall have his Liberty when it is
paid you? And why should he trust you so far, as to pay
the Money, and yet remain here a Prisoner?
Th1s carried so much Reason with it, that the Corregi-
dore knew not what to say; but that so was the Law, and
he could act no otherwise, but by the very Letter of it;
and here each was so positive, that nothing could deter-
mine it, but another Express to be sent to the Viceroy of
Mexico.
Upon this, the Governor was so kind, as to say he
would get me a Passport for any Body that should bring
the Money, and any Vessel they were in, by his own Au-
thority, and for their safe returning, and taking me with
them, provided I would answer for it, that they should
bring no European, or other Goods whatever with them,
and should not set Foot on Shore without his express
Permission, and provided he did not receive Orders to
the contrary, in the mean Time, from any superior Hand,
and that even in such a Case, they should have Liberty to
go back freely from whence they came, under the Pro-
tection of a white Flag.
I bow'd very respectfully to the Governor, in token of
my acknowledging his Justice, and then presented my
humble Petition to him, that he would allow my Men to
take their own Sloop, that it should be rated at a certain
Value, and would be oblig'd they should bring Specie
on Board with them, and that they should either pay it for
the Sloop, or leave the Sloop again.
Then he enquired to what Country I would send them
for so much Money, and if I could assure him of the Pay-
ment; and when he understood it was no farther than to
Virginia, he seem'd very easy, and to satisfy the Corregi-
dore, who still stood off, adhering with a true Spanish Stiff-
ness to the Letter of the Law; the said Governor calls out
to me: Seignior, (says he) I shall make all this Matter easy
to you, if you agree to my Proposal; your Men shall have
the Sloop, on Condition you shall be my Hostage for her
Return; but they shall not take her as your Sloop, tho' she
shall in the Effect be yours, on the Payment of the Mo-
ney ; but you shall take two of my Men on Board with you
upon your Parole, for their safe Return, and when she re-
turns, she shall carry his Catholick Majesty's Colours, and
be enter'd as one of the Sloops belonging to the Havana;
one of the Spaniards to be Commander, and to be call'd
by such a Name as he should appoint.
This the Corregidore came into immediately, and said,
this was within the Letter of the King's Commanderie, or
Precept, upon Condition, however, that she should bring
no European Goods on Board. I desir'd it might be put in
other Words; namely, that she should bring no European
Goods on Shore: It cost two Days Debate between these
two, whether it should pass, that no European Goods
should be brought in the Ship, or brought on Shore; but
having found Means to intimate, that I meant not to
Trade there, but would not be tied from bringing a small
Present to a certain Person, in acknowledgement of Fa-
vours; I say, after I had found Room to place such a Hint
right, where it should be plac'd, I found it was all made
easy to me, and it was all agreed presently, that after the
Ransom was paid, and the Ship also bought, it was but
reasonable, that I should have Liberty to Trade to any
other Country, not in the Dominions'of the Kingof Spain,
so to make up my Losses; and that it would be hard to
oblige my Men to bring away the Vessel light, and so
lose the Voyage, and add so much to our former Misfor-
tunes ; that so long as no Goods were brought on Shore in
the Country belonging to his Catholick MajesTy's Do-
minions, which was all that they had to defend, that the
rest was no Business of theirs.
Now I began to see my Way thro' this unhappy Busi-
ness, and to find, that as Money would bring me out of it,
so Money would bring it to turn to a good Account an-
other Way; wherefore I sent the Sloop away under Span-
ish Colours, and call'd her the Nueslra Segniora de la Val
de Grace, command by Seignior Giraldo de Nesma, one of
the two Spaniards.
With the Sloop I sent Letters to my Wife, and to my
chief Manager, with Orders to load her back, as I there
directed, viz. That she should have 200 Barrels of Flow-
er, 50 Barrels of Pease, and to answer my other Views, I
ordered i00 Bales to be made up of all Sorts of European
Goods, suchasnotmy own Ware-houses only would sup-
ply, but such as they could be supply'd with in other
Ware-houses, where I knew they had Credit for any
Thing.
In this Cargo I directed all the richest, and mosT: valu-
able English Goods they had, or could get, whether Lin-
nen, Woollen or Silk, to be made up; the coarser Things,
such as we use in Virginia, for cloathing of Servants, such
I ordered to be left behind, for the Use of the Plantation:
In less than seven Weeks Time the Sloop return'd, and I,
that fail'd not every Day to look out for her on the Strand,
was the firs! that spy'd her at Sea at a Distance, and knew
her by her Sails, but afterwards more particularly by her
Signals.
When she return'd, she came into the Road with her
Spanish Antient flying, and came to an Anchor, as direct-
ed; but I, that had seen her some Hours before, went di-
rectly to the Governor, and gave him an Account of her
being come, and fain I would have obtain'd the Favour to
have his Excellence (as I call'd him) go on Board in Per-
son, that he might see how well his Orders were execut-
ed; but he declin'd that, saying, he could not justify go-
ing off of the Island, which was, in short, to go out of his
Command of the Fort, which he could not re-assume
without a new Commission from the King's own Hand.
Then I ask'd Leave to go on Board myself, which he
granted me, and I brought on Shore with me the full sum
in Gold, which I had condition'd to pay for the Ransom,
both of my Men and myself, and for the Purchase of the
Sloop; and as I obtain'd Leave to land in a different Place,
so my Governor sent his Son with six Soldiers, to receive
and convey me with the Money to the Castle, where he
commanded, and therein to his own House: I had made
up the Money in heavy Parcels, as if it had been all Silver,
and gave it to two of my Men, who belong'd to the Sloop,
with Orders to them, that they should make it seem, by
their carrying it, to be much heavier than it was; this was
done to conceal three Parcels of Goods, which I had
pack'd up with the Money, to make a Present to the Go-
vernor, as I intended.
When the Money was carried in, and laid down on a
Table, my Governor order'd the Men to withdraw, and I
gave the Soldiers each of them a Piece of Eight to drink,
for which they were very thankful, and the Governor
seem very well pleas'd with it also: Then I ask'd him plea-
santly if he would please to receive the Money, he said no,
he would not receive it, but in Presence of the Corregidorey
and the other People concern'd; then I begg'd his Excel-
lency (as I call'd him) to give me Leave to open the Par-
cels in his Presence, for that I would do myself the Hon-
our to acknowledge his Favours in the best Manner I
could.
He told me no, he could not see any Thing be brought
on Shore, but the Money; but if I had brought anyThing
on Shore for my own Use, he would not be so sTricl: to en-
quire into that, so I might do what I pleas'd myself.
Upon that I went into the Place, shut myself in, and
having open'd all the Things, and placed them to my
Mind: There was five little Parcels, as follows,
i, 2. A Piece of 20 Yards fine English Broad-Cloth, 5
Yards of Black, 5 Yards of Crimson, in one Par-
cel, and the rest of fine Mixtures in another Par-
cel.
3. A Piece of 30 Ells of fine Holland Linnen.
4. A Piece of 18 Yards of fine English brocaded Silk.
5. A Piece of black Colchesler Bays.
After I had plac'd these by themselves, I found Means
with some seeming Difficulties, and much Grimace, to
bring him to know that this was intended for a Present to
himself: After all that Part was over, and he had seem'd
to accept them, signified, after walking a hundred Turns-
>
and more in the Room by them, by throwing his Hat,
which was under his Arm, upon them, and making a very
stiff Bow, I say, after this, he seem'd to take his Leave of
me for a while, and I waited in an outer Room, when I
was call'd in again; I found that he had look'd over all the
Particulars, and caus'd them to be remov'd out of the
Place.
But when I came again, I found him quite another
Man; he thank'd me for my Present, told me, it was a
Present fit to be given to a Viceroy of Mexico, rather than
to a meer Governor of a Fort, that he had done me no
Services suitable to such a Return, but that he would see
if he could not oblige me farther before I left the Place.
After our Compliments were over, I obtain'd to have
the Corregidore sent for, who accordingly came, and in
his Presence the Money, stipulated for the Ransome of
the Ship, and of the Men, was paid.
But here the Corregidore shew'd that he would be as
severely just on my Side, as on theirs, for he would not
admit the Money as a Ransom for us as Prisoners, but as
a Deposite for so much as we were to be ransom'd for, if
the Sentence for our being made Prisoners should be con-
firm'd.
And then the Governor and Corregidore joining to-
gether, sent a Representation of the whole Affair, at least
we were told so, to the Viceroy of Mexico; and it was pri-
vately hinted to me, that I would do well to stay for the
Return of the Aviso, that is, a Boat which they send over
the Bay to Vera Cruz, with an Express to Mexico, whose
Return is generally perform'd in two Months.
I was not unwilling to stay, having secret Hints given
me, that I should find some Way to go with my Sloop to-
wards Vera Cruiz myself, where I might have an Occa-
sion to Trade privately for the Cargo which I had on
Board; but it came about a nearer Way, for about two
Days after this Money being deposited, (as above) the
Governor's Son invited himself on Board my Sloop, where
I told him I would be very glad to see him, and whither
at the same Time he brought with him three considerable
Merchants, Spaniards, two of them not Inhabitants of
the Place.
When they were on Board, they were very merry and
pleasant, and I treated them so much to their Satisfaction,
that in short, they were not well able to go on Shore for
that Night, but were content to take a Nap on some Car-
pets which I caus'd to be spread for them, and that the
Governor's Son might think himself well us'd, I brought
him a very good Silk Night-Gown, with a Crimson Vel-
vet Cap to lie down in, and in the Morning desir'd him to
accept of them for his use, which he took very kindly.
Du ri ng that merry Evening, one of the Merchants not
so touch'd with Drink as the young Gentleman, nor so, as
not to mind what it was he came about, takes an Occasion
to withdraw out of the great Cabbin, and enter into a Par-
ley with the Master of the Sloop, in order to Trade for
what European Goods we had on Board; the Master took
the Hint, and gave me Notice of what had pass'd, and I
gave him Instructions what to say, and what to do; ac-
cording to which Instructions, they made butfew Words,
for about 5000 Pieces of Eight, and carried the Goods
away themselves, at and their own Hazards.
This was very agreeable to me, for now I began toseel
should lick myself whole, by the Sale of this Cargo, and
should make myself full amends of Jack Spaniard, for all
the Injuries he had done me in the first of these Things;
with this View I gave my Master, or Captain of the Sloop,
Instructions for Sale of all the rest of the Goods, and left
him to manage by himself, which he did so well, that he
sold the whole Cargo the next Day to the three Spaniards,
with this additional Circumstance, that they desir'd the
Sloop might carry the Goods, as they were on Board, to
such Part of the Terra Firma, as they should appoint be-
tween the Honduras and the Coast of La Vera Cruiz.
It was difficult for me to make good this Part of the
Bargain, but finding the Price agreed for would very well
answer the Voyage, I consented; but then how to send
the Sloop away, and remain among the Spaniards, when I
was now a clear Man, this was a Difficulty too, as it was
also to go away, and not wait for a favourable Answer
from the Viceroy of Mexico, to the Representation of the
Governor and the Corregidore\ however, at lasT: resolv'd
to go in the Sloop, fall out what would, so I went to the
Governor, and represented to him, that being now to ex-
pect a favourable Answer from Mexico, it would be a great
Loss to me to keep the Sloop there all the while, and I de-
sir'd his Leave for me to go with the Sloop to Antegoa, to
sell and dispose of the Cargo, which he well knew I was
oblig'd not to bring on Shore there at the Havana, and
which would be in Danger of being spoil'd by lying so
long on Board.
This I obtain'd readily, with License to come again in-
to the Road, and (for myself only) to come on Shore, in
order to hear the Viceroy's Pleasure in my Case, which
was depending.
Having thus obtain'd a License at, or Passport for the
Sloop and myself, I put to Sea with the three Spanish Mer-
chants on Board with me; they told me, they did not live
at the Havana, but it seems one of them did; and some
rich Merchantsjof the Havana, or of the Parts thereabouts
in the same Island, were concern'd with them; for they
brought on Board, that Night we put to Sea, a great Sum
of Money in Pieces of Eight, and, as I understood after-
wards, that these Merchants bought the Cargo of me,
and tho' they gave me a very great Price for every Thing,
yet that they sold them again to the Merchants, who they
procur'd on the Coast of La Vera Cruiz, at a prodigious
Advantage; so that they got above a Hundred per Cent,
after I had gain'd very sufficiently before.
We sail'd from the Havana directly for Vera Cruiz, I
scrupled venturing into the Port at first, and was very un-
easy, least I should have another Spanish Trick put upon
me; but as we sail'd under Spanish Colours, they shew'd
us such authentick Papers from the proper Officers, that
there was no Room to fear any Thing.
However, when we came in Sight of the SpanishCo&ii,
I found that they had a secret*clandestine Trade to carry
on, which tho' it was secret, yet they knew the Way of it
so well, that it was but a meer Road to them. The Case was
this, we stood in close under Shore in the Night, about six
Leagues to the North of the Port, where two of the three
Merchants went on Shore in the Boat, and in three Hours,
or thereabouts, they came on Board again with five Ca-
noes, and seven or eight Merchants more with them, and
as soon as they were on Board, we stood off to Sea, so that
by Day-light we were quite out of Sight of Land.
I ought to have mention'd before, that as soon as we
were put to Sea from the Havana, and during our Voyage
into the Gulph of Mexico, which was eight Days, we rum-
vol. u k
ag'd the whole Cargo, and opening every Bale, as far as
the Spanish Merchants desired, we trafficked with them for
the whole Cargo, except the Barrels of Flower and Pease.
Th1s Cargo was considerable in itself, for my Wife's
Account, or Invoyce, drawn out by my Tutor, and Man-
ager, amounted to 2684 /. 10 s. and I sold the whole, in-
cluding what had been sold in the Evening, when they
were on Board first, (as I have said) for 38593 Pieces of
Eight, and they allow'd me 1200 Pieces of Eight for the
Freight of the Sloop, and made my Master and the Sea-
men very handsome Presents besides, and they were well
able to do this too, as you shall hear presently.
After we were gotten out of Sight of Land, the Spani-
ardsfell to their Traffick, and our three Merchants open'd
their Shop, as they might say, for it was their Shop; as to
me, I had nothing to do with it, or with their Goods, they
drove their Bargain in a few Hours, and at Night we stood
in again for the Shore, when the five Canoes carry'd a
great part of the Goods on Shore, and brought the Money
back in Specie, as well for that they carry'd as for all the
rest, and at their second Voyage carry'd all away clear,
leaving me nothing on Board but my Barrels of Flower
and Pease, which they bad me Money for too, but not so
much as I expected.
Here I found that my Spanish Merchants made above
70000 Pieces of Eight of the Cargo I had sold them, up-
on which, I had a great Mind to be acquainted with those
Merchants on the Terra Firma, who were the last Custo-
mers, for it presently occurr'd to me, that I could easily
go with a Sloop from Virginia, and taking a Cargo direct-
ed on Purpose from England, of about 5 or 6000/. I might
easily make four of one; with this View I began to make a
kind of an Acquaintance with the Spaniards which came
in the Canoes, and we became so intimate, that at last,
with the Consent of the three Spaniards of the Havana, I
accepted an Invitation on Shore to their House, which
was a little Villa, or rather Plantation, where they had an
Ingenio, that is to say, a Sugar-house, or Sugar-Work, and
there they treated us like Princes.
iTOOKOccasion at this Invitation to say, that if I knew
how to find my Way thither again, I could visit them once
or twice a Year, very much to their Advantage and mine
too: One of the Spaniards took the Hint, and taking me
into a Room by myself, Seignior, says he, if you have any
Thoughts of coming to this Place again, I shall give you
such Directions as you shall be sure not to mistake, and
upon either coming on Shore in the Night, and coming
up to this Place, or, upon making the Signals which we
shall give you, we will not fail to come off to you, and
bring Money enough for any Cargaison, so they call it,
that you shall bring.
iTOOKall their Directions, took their Paroles of Hon-
our for my Safety, and without taking any Notice to my
first three Merchants, laid up all the rest in my most se-
cret Thoughts, resolving to visit them again in as short a
Time as I could; and thus, having in about five Days fin-
ished all our Merchandizing, we stood off to Sea, and
made for the Island of Cuba, where I set my three Spani-
ards on Shore with all their Treasure, to their Hearts Con-
tent, and made the best of my Way to Antigua, where with
all the Dispatch I could, I sold my 200 Barrels of Flower,
which however, had suffer'd a little, by the length of the
Voyage, and having laden the Sloop with Rum, Molasses,
and Sugar, I set Sail again for the Havana.
I was now uneasy indeed, for Fear of the Pyrates, for I
was a rich Ship, having besides Goods, near 40000 Pieces
of Eight in Silver.
When I came back to the Havana, I went on Shore to
wait on the Governor and the Corregidore, and to hear
what Return was had from the Viceroy, and had the good
Fortune to know that the Viceroy had disallow'd that
Part of the Sentence which condemn'd us as Prisoners,
and put a Ransom on us, which he insisted could not be,
but in Time of open War; but as to the Confiscation, he
deferr'd it to the Chamber or Council of Commerce at
Sevil, and the Appeal to the King if such be preferr'd.
This was in some Measure, avery good Piece of Justice
in the Viceroy, for as we had not been on Shore, we could
not be legally imprison'd; and for the rest, I believe if I
would have given myself the Trouble to have gone to old
Spain, and have preferr'd my Claim to both the Ship and
the Cargo, I had recover'd them also.
HowEVERas it was, I was now a free Man without Ran-
som, and my Men were also free, so that all the Money
which I had deposited, as above, was return'd me; and
thus I took my Leave of the Havana, and made the best
of my Way for Virginia, where I arriv'd after a Year and a
half Absence, and notwithstanding all my Losses, came
Home above 4000 Pieces of Eight richer than I went out.
As to the old Affair about the Preslon Prisoners, that
was quite at an End,for the general Pardon past in Parlia-
ment made me perfectly easy, and I took no more Thought
about that Part: I might here very usefully observe, how
necessary and inseparable a Companion Fear is to Guilt;
it was but a few Months that the Face of a poor Predion
Transport, would have frighted me out of my Wits; to
avoid them I fain'd myself sick, and wrapt my Legs in
Flannel, as if I had the Gout, whereas now, they were no
more Surprize to me, nor was I any more uneasy to see
them, than I was to see any other of the Servants of the
Plantations.
And that which was more particular than all was, that
tho' before I fancied every one of them would know me,
and remember me, and consequently betray and accuse
me; now, tho' I was frequently among them, and saw
most of them, and if not all of them, one Time or other,
nay, tho' I remember'd several of their Faces, and even
some of their Names, yet there was not a Man of them
that ever took the least Notice of me, or of having known
or seen me before.
It would have been a singular Satisfaction to me, if I
could have known so much as this of them before, and
had saved me all the Fatigue, Hazard, and Misfortune
that befell me afterwards; but Man, a short sighted Crea-
ture, sees so little before him, that he can neither antici-
pate his Joys, nor prevent his Disasters, be they ever so
little a Distance from him.
I had now my Head full of my Wesl-India Project, and
I began to make Provision for it accordingly; I had a full
Account of what European Goods were most acceptable
in New Spain, and to add to my Speed, I knew that the
Spaniards were in great want of European Goods; the
Galleons from Old Spain having been delay'd to an un-
usual length of Time, for the two Years before: Upon
this Account, having not Time, as I thought, to send to
England for a Cargo of such Goods as were most proper;
I resolv'd to load my Sloop with Tobacco and Rum, the
last I brought from Antigua, and go away to Boslon in New
England, and to New-York, and see if I could pick up a
Cargo to my Mind.
AccoRDiNGlYltook 20000 Pieces of Eight in Money,
and my Sloop laden as above, and taking my Wife with
me, we went away; it was an odd and new Thing at New-
England, to have such a quantity of Goods bought up there
by a Sloop from Virginia, and especially to be paid for in
ready Money, as I did for most of my Goods; and this set
all the Trading Heads upon the Stretch, to enquire what,
and who I was, to which they had an immediate and di-
rect Answer, that I was a very considerable Planter in Vir-
ginia, and that was all, any of my Men on Board the Sloop
could tell of me, and enough too.
Well, it was the Cause of much Speculation among
them, as I heard at second and third Hands; some said,
he is certainly going to Jamaica, others said, he is going
to Trade with the Spaniards; others, that he is going to
the South-Sea, and turn half Merchant, half Pyrate, on
the Coast of Chily and Peru; some one Thing, some an-
other, as the Men Gossips found their Imaginations di-
rected: But we went on with our Business, and laid out
i2000 Pieces of Eight, besides our Cargo of Rum and
Tobacco, and went from thence to New-York, where we
laid out the rest.
The chief of the Cargo we bought here was, fine Eng-
lish Broad Cloth, Serges,Druggets, Norwich Stuffs, Bays,
Says, and all kinds of Woollen Manufactures, as also Lin-
nen of all sorts, a very great Quantity, and near a i ooo /.
in fine Silks, of several Sorts.
Being thus freighted, I came back safe to Virginia, and
with very little Addition to my Cargo, began to prepare
for my Wesl-India Voyage.
I should have mention'd, that I had built upon my
Sloop, and raised her a little, so that I had made her carry
12 Guns, and fitted her up for Defence, for I thought she
should not be attack'd and Boarded by a few Spanish Barco
Longos, as she was before; and I found the Benefit of it
afterwards, as you shall hear.
We set Sail the beginning of Augusl, and as I had twice
been attack'd by Pyrates in passing the Gulph of Florida,
or among the Bahama Islands, I resolv'd, tho' it was far-
ther about to stand off to Sea, and so keep as I believ'd it
would be, out of the Way of them.
We passed the Tropick as near as we could guess, just
where the famous Sir William Phipps fish'd up the Silver
from the Spanish Plate Wreck, and standing in between
the Islands, kept our Course W. by S. keeping under the
Isle of Cuba, and so running away, Trade, as they call it,
into the great Gulph of Mexico, leaving the Island of Ja-
maica to the S. and S. E. by this Means avoiding, as I
thought, all the Spaniards of Cuba, or the Havana.
As we passed the West Point of Cuba, three Spanish
Boats came off to Board us, as they had done before, on
the other Side of the Island; but they found themselves
mistaken, we were too many for them, for we run out our
Guns, which they did not perceive before, and firingthree
or four Shot at them, they retir'd.
The next Morning they appear'd again, being five
large Boats and a Bark, and gave us Chase; but we then
spread our Spanish Colours, and brought too to fight
them, at which they retir'd, so we escaped this Danger by
the Addition of Force which we had made to our Vessel.
We now had a fair run for our Port, and as I had taken
very good Directions, I stood away to the North of St.
John d'Ulva, and then running in for the Shore, found
the Place appointed exactly, and going on Shore, I sent
the Master of my Sloop directly to the Ingenio, where he
found the Spanish Merchant at his House, and where he
dwelt like a little Sovereign Prince, who welcom'd him,
and understanding that I was in a particular Boat at the
Creek, as appointed, he came immediately with him, and
bringing another Spaniard from a Villa not far off, in
about four Hours they were with me.
They would have perswaded me to go up to their
Houses, and have staid there till the next Night, ordering
the Sloop to stand off as usual, but I would notconsentto
let the Sloop go to Sea without me, so we went on Board
directly, and as the Night was almost run, stood off to Sea,
so by Day-break we were quite out of Sight of Land.
Here we began, as I said before, to open Shop, and I
found the Spaniards were extreamly surpriz'd at seeing
such a Cargo, I mean so large, for in short, they had cared
not if it had been four Times as much: They soon ran
thro' the Contents of all the Bales we open'd that Night,
and with very little Dispute about the Price they approv'd,
and accepted all that I show'd them; but as they said,
they had not Money for any greater Parcel, they agreed
to go on Shore the next Evening for more Money.
However, we spent the Remainder of the Night in
looking over and making Inventories, or Invoyces of the
rest of the Cargo, that so they might see the Goods, know
the Value, and knowwhatmore Moneythey had to bring.
Accordingly, in the Evening we stood in for the Shore,
and they carried Part of the Cargo with them, borrowing
the Sloop's Boat to assist them, and after they had lodg'd
and landed the Goods, they came on Board again, bring-
ing three of the other Merchants with them, who were
concern'd before, and Money enough to clear the whole
Ship, ay, and Ship and all, if I had been willing to sell her.
To give them their due, they dealt with me like Men
of Honour; they were indeed sensible that they bought
every Thing much cheaper of me, than they did before of
the three Merchants of the Havana; these Merchants
having been as it were the Hucksters, and bought them
first of me, and then advanc'd,aslhave said, above i00
per Cent, upon the Price they gave me; but yet at the same
Time I advanc'd in the Price much more now, than I did
before to the said Spaniards, nor was it without Reason,
because of the length and risque of the Voyage, both out
and Home, which now lay wholly upon me.
I n short, I sold the whole Cargo to them, and for which
I receiv'd near 200,000 Pieces of Eight in Money, be-
sides which, when they came on Board the second Time,
they brought all their Boats loaden with fresh Provisions,
Hogs, Sheep, Fowls, Sweetmeats, &c. enough for my
whole Voyage, all which they made a Present to me of,
and thus we finish'd our Traffick to our mutual Satisfac-
tion, and parted with Promises of farther Commerce, and
with Assurances on their Part of all Acts of Friendship
and Assistance, that I could desire, if any Disaster should
befal me in any of these Adventures; asindeed was not im-
probable, considering the Strictness and Severity of their
Customs, in case any People were taken Trading upon
their Coast.
I immediatelycall'd a Council with my little Crew,
which Way we should go back; the Mate was for beating
it up to Windward, and getting up to Jamaica, but as we
were too rich to run any Risques, and were to take the
best Course to get safe Home, I thought, and so did the
Master of the Sloop, that our best Way was to Coast
about the Bay, and keeping the Shore oi Floridaon Board,
make the shortest Course to the Gulph, and so make for
the Coast of Carolina, and to put in there into the first
Port we could, and wait for any English Men of War that
might be on the Coast to secure us to the Capes.
This was the best Course we could take, and prov'd
very safe to us, excepting that about the Cape of Florida,
and on the Coast in the Gulph, till we came to the height
of St. Augusline; we were several Times visited with the
Spaniards Barco Longos, and small Barks, in Hopes of
making a Prize of us; but carrying Spanish Colours, de-
ceiv'd most of them, and a good Tire of Guns kept the
rest at a Distance, so that we came safe, tho' once or twice
in Danger of being run on Shore by a Storm of Wind; I
say, we came safe into Charles River in Carolina.
From hence I found Means to send a Letter Home,
with an Account to my Wife of my good Success, and
having an Account that the Coast was clear of Pyrates,
tho' there were no Men of War in the Place, I ventur'd
forward, and in short, got safe into the Bay of Chesapeak,
that is to say, within the Capes of Virginia, and in a few
Days more to my own House, having been absent three
Months and four Days.
NEVERdid any Vessel on this Side the World make a
better Voyage in so short a Time, than I made in this
Sloop, for by the most moderate Computation, I clear'd
in these three Months 25000 /. Sterling in ready Money,
all the Charges of the Voyage to New-England also being
reckon'd up.
Now was my Time to have sat still contented with what
I had got, if it was in the Power of Man to know when his
good Fortune was at the highest, and more, my prudent
Wife gave it as her Opinion, that I should sit down satis-
fy'd, and push the Affair no farther, and earnestly per-
swaded me to do so; but I that had a Door open, as I
thought, to immense Treasure, that had found the Way
to have a Stream of the Golden Rivers of Mexico flow into
my Plantation of Virginia, and saw no Hazards, more
then what was common to all such Things in the Prose-
cution; I say to me, these Things look'd with another
Face, and I dream'd of nothing but Millions, and Hun-
dred of Thousands; so contrary to all moderate Measures,
I push'd on for another Voyage, and laid up a Stock of all
sorts of Goods that I could get together, proper for the
Trade: I did not indeed go again to New-England, for I
had by this Time a very good Cargo come from England,
pursuant to a Commission I had sent several Months be-
fore ; so that in short, my Cargo, according to the Invoyce
now made up, amounted to above 10000 /. Sterling first
Cost, and was a Cargo so sorted, and so well bought, that
I expected to have advanc'd upon them much more in
proportion than I had done in the Cargo before.
W1th these Expectations, we began our second Voy-
age in April, being about five Months after our Return
from the first; we had not indeed the same good Speed,
even in our Beginning, as we had at first, for tho' we stood
off to Sea about 60 Leagues, in order to be out of the Way
of the Pyrates, yet we had not been above five Days at
Sea, but we were visited and rifled by two Pyrate Barks,
who being bound to the Northward, that is to say, the
Banks of Newfoundland, took away all our Provisions,
and all our Ammunition, and small Arms, and left us ve-
ry ill provided to pursue our Voyage; and it being so near
Home,we thought it adviseable to come about, and stand
in for the Capes again, to restore our Condition, and furn-
ish ourselves with Stores of all kinds for our Voyage; this
took us up about ten Days, and we put to Sea again; as for
our Cargo, the Pyrates did not meddle with it, being all
Bale Goods,which they had no present Use for, and knew
not what to do with, if they had them.
We met with no other Adventure worth naming, till
by the same Course that we had steer'd before, we came
into the Gulph of Mexico, and the first Misfortune we met
with here was, that on the Back of Cuba, crossing towards
the Point of the Terra Firma, on the Coast of Jucatan, we
had Sight of the Flota of New-Spain, that is, of the Ships
which come from Carthagena or Porto Bello, and go to the
Havana, in order to pursue their Voyage to Europe.
They had with them one Spanish Man of War, and
three Frigats, two of the Frigats gave us chase, but it be-
ing just at the shutting in of the Day, we soon lost sight of
them, and standing to the North, cross the Bay of Mexico,
as if we were going to the Mouth of Missippi, they lost us
quite, and in a few Days more we made the bottom of the
Bay, being the Port we were bound for.
We stood in as usual, in the Night, and gave Notice to
our Friends, but instead of their former Readiness to
come on Board, they gave us Notice, that we had been
seen in the Bay, and that Notice of us was given at Vera
Cruz, and at other Places, and that several Frigats were
in Quest of us, and that three more would be cruizing the
next Morning in search for us.
We could not conceive how this could be; but we were
afterwards told, that those three Frigats, having lost Sight
of us in the Night, had made in for the Shore, and had
given the Alarm of us as of Privateers.
Be that as it would, we had nothing to do, but to con-
sider what Course to take immediately, the Spanish Mer-
chants Advice was very good if we had taken it, namely,
to have unladen as many of our Bails as we could that very
Night, by the Help of our Boat and their Canoes, and to
make the best of our Way in the Morning to the North of
the Gulph, and take our Fate.
This my Skipper or Master, thought very well of, but
when we began to put it in Execution, we were so confus-
ed, and in such a Hurry, being not resolv'd what Course
to take, that we could not get out above sixteen Bales of all
sorts of Goods, before it began to be too light, and we be-
hov'd to set Sail; at la&, the Master proposed a Medium,
which was, that I should go on Shore in the next Boat, in
which was five Bales of Goods more, and that I should
stay on Shore, if the Spanish Merchants would undertake
to conceal me, and let them go to Sea, and take their
Chance.
The Spanish Merchants readily undertook to protect
me, especially it being so easy to have me pass for a natur-
al Spaniard, and so they took me on Shore with 2i Bales
of my Goods, and the Sloop stood off to Sea; if they met
with any Enemies, they were to stand in for the Shore the
next Night, and we fail'd not to look well out for them,
but to no Purpose, for the next Day they were discovered
and chased by two Spanish Frigats; they stood from them,
and the Sloop being an excellent Sailor, gain'd so much,
that they would certainly have been clear of them when
Night came on, but a small Picaroon of a Sloop kept them
Company in spight of all they could do, and two or three
Times offer'd to engage them, thereby to give Time to
the rest to come up, but the Sloop kept her Way, and gave
them a Chase of three Days and Nights, having a fresh
Gale of Wind at S. W. till she made the Rio Grand, or as
the French call it, the Missippi, and there finding no
Remedy, they run the Vessel on Shore, not far from the
Fort, which the Spaniards call Pensacola, Garrison'd at
that Time with French; our Men would have enter'd the
River as a Port, but having no Pilot, and the Current of
the River being strong against them, the Sloop run on
Shore, and the Men shifted as well as they could in their
Boats.
I was now in a very odd Condition indeed, my Circum-
stances were in one Sense indeed very happy, namely,
that I was in the Hands of my Friends, for such really
they were, and so faithful, that no Men could have been
more careful of their own Safety, than were they of mine;
and that which added to the Comfort of my new Condi-
tion, was the Produce of my Goods, which were gotten
on Shore by their own Advice and Direction, which was a
Fund sufficient to maintain me with them as long as I
could be supposed to stay there; and, if not the first Mer-
chant to whose House I went, assured me, that he would
give me Credit for 20000 Pieces of Eight, if I had occa-
sion for it.
My greatest Affliction was, that I knew not how to
convey News to my Wife of my present Condition, and
how among the many Misfortunes of the Voyage, I was
yet safe, and in good Hands.
But there was no Remedy for this Part, but the great
universal Cure of all incurable Sorrows, viz. Patience,
and indeed I had a great deal of Reason, not for Patience
only, but Thankfulness, if I had known the Circumstances
which I should have been reduc'd to, if I had fallen
into the Hands of the Spaniards; the best of which that
I could reasonably have expected, had been, to have sent
to the Mines, or which was ten Thousand Times worse,
the Inquisition; or if I had escaped the Spaniards, as my
Men in the Sloop did, the Hardships they were exposed
to, the Dangers they were in, and the Miseries they suf-
fer'd, were still worse, in wandering among Savages, and
the more Savage French, who plunder'd and strip'd them,
instead of relieving and supplying them in their long
Wilderness Journey over the Mountains, till they reach'd
the S. W. Parts of South Carolina, a Journey which in-
deed deserves to have an Account to be given of it by it-
self; I say, all these Things had I known of them, would
have let me see that I had a great deal of Reason, not only
to be Patient under my present Circumstances, but satis-
fied, and thankful.
Here, as I said, my Patron the Merchant, entertain'd
me like a Prince, he made my Safety his peculiar Care,
and while we were in any Expectation of the Sloop being
taken, and brought into Vera Cruz, he kept me retir'd at
a little House in a Wood, where he kept a fine Avery of all
sorts of American Birds, and out of which he yearly sent
some as Presents to his Friends in Old Spain.
This Retreat was necessary, least if the Sloop should
be taken and brought into Vera Cruz, and the Men be
brought in Prisoners, they should be tempted to give an
Account of me as their Super-Cargo or Merchant, and
where both I and the 2i Bales of Goods were set on Shore;
as for the Goods, he made sure Work with them, for they
were all open'd, taken out of the Bales, and separated, and
being mix'd with other European Goods which came by
the Galeons, were made up in new Package, and sent to
Mexico in several Parcels, some to one Merchant, some to
another; so that it was impossible to have found them out,
even if they had had Information of them.
In this Posture, and in Apprehension of some bad
News of the Sloop, I remain'd at the Villa, or House in
the Vale, for so they call'd it, about five Weeks; I had two
Negroes appointed to wait on me, one of which was my
Purveyor, or my Cook, the other my Valet; and my
Friend, the Master of all, came constantly every Evening
to visit, and sup with me, when we walked out together
into the Avery, which was of its kind, the most beautiful
Thing that ever I saw in the World.
After above five Weeks Retreat of this kind, he had
good Intelligence of the Fate of the Sloop, viz. that the
two Frigats and a Sloop had chased her till she ran on
Ground near the Fort of Pensacola, that they saw her
strand'd and broke in Pieces by the Force of the Waves,
the Men making their Escape in their Boat. This News
was brought it seems, by the said Frigats to La Vera
Crux, where my Friend went on Purpose to be fully in-
form'd, and receiv'd the Account from one of the Cap-
tains of the Frigats, and discoursed with him at large
about it.
I was better pleased with the Loss of the Sloop and all
my Cargo, the Men being got on Shore and escaping,
than I should have been with the saving the whole Cargo,
if the Men had fallen into the Hands of the Spaniards,
for now I was safe, whereas then it being supposed they
would have been forced to some Discovery about me, I
must have fled, and should have found it very difficult to
have made their Escape, even with all that my Friends
could have done for me too.
But now I was perfectly easy, and my Friend, who
thought confining me at the House in the Vale, no longer
needful, brought me publickly Home to his Dwelling-
House, as a Merchant come from Old-Spain, by the last
Galeons, and who having been at Mexico, was come to re-
side with him.
Here I was dressed like a Spaniard of the better Sort,
had three Negroes to attend me, and was call'd Don Ferdi-
nand de Villa Moresa, in Caslilia Feja, that is to say, in
Old-Caslile.
Here I had nothing to do but to walk about, and ride
out into the Woods, and come Home again to enjoy the
pleasantest, and most agreeable Retirement in the World;
for certainly no Men in the World live in such Splendor,
and wallow in such immense Treasures as the Merchants
of this Place.
They live, as I have said, in a kind of Country Retreat
at their Villas, or as we would call them in Virginia, their
Plantations, and as they do call them, their Ingenios,vrhere
they make their Indigo, and their Sugars; but they have
also Houses, and Ware-houses, at Vera Cruz, where they
go twice a Year, when the Galeons arrive from Old-Spain,
and when those Galeons re-lade for their Return; and it
was surprizing to me, when I went to La Vera Cruz with
them, to see what prodigious Consignments they had
from their Correspondents in Old-Spain, and with what
Dispatch they manag'd them; for no sooner were the
Cases, Packs, and Bales of European Goods brought into
their Ware-houses, but they were open'd, and re-pack'd
by Porters and Packers of their own, that is to say, Ne-
vol. 11 1
groes and Indian Servants; and being made up into new
Bales, and separate Parcels, were all dispatch'd again, by
Horses for Mexico, and directed to their several Mer-
chants there, and the Remainder carry'd Home, as above,
to the Ingenio, where they liv'd, which was near 30 Eng-
lish Miles from Vera Cruz, so that in about 20 Days,
their Ware-houses were again entirely free: At La Vera
Crux, all their Business was over there, and they, and all
their Servants retir'd; for they stay'd no longer there than
needs must, because the unhealthiness of the Air.
After the Goods were thus dispatched, it was equally
surprizing, to see how soon, and with what Exactness,
the Merchants of Mexico, to whom those Cargoes were
separately consign'd, made the Return, and how it came
all in Silver or in Gold, so that their Warehouses in a few
Months, were piled up even to the Ceiling, with Chests
of Pieces of Eight, and with Bars of Silver.
It is impossible to describe in the narrow Compass of
this Work, with what Exactness and Order, and yet with
how little Hurry, and not the least Confusion, every
Thing was done, and how soon a Weight of Business of
such Importance and Value, was negotiated and finish'd,
the Goods re-pack'd, Invoyces made, and every Thing
dispatch'd and gone; so that in about five Weeks, all the
Goods they had receiv'd from Europe by the Galeons
were disposed of, and entered in their Journals, to the
proper Account of their Merchant, to whom they were
respectively consign'd; from thence they had Book-keep-
ers, who drew out the Invoyces, and wrote the Letters,
which the Merchant himself only read over, and sign'd,
and then other Hands copied all again into other Books.
I can give no Estimate of the Value of the several Con-
signments they receiv'd by that Flota; but I remember,
that when the Galeons went back, they shipp'd on Board
at several Times, one Million, three Hundred Thousand
Pieces of Eight in Specie, besides 180 Bales or Bags of
Cochoneal, and about 300 Bales of Indigo, but they were so
modest, that they said, this was for themselves and their
Friends; that is to say, the several Merchants of Mexico,
consign'd large Quantities of Bullion to them, to ship on
Board, and consign according to their Order; but then I
know also, that for all that, they were allow'd Commis-
sion, so that their Gain was very considerable, even that
Way also.
I had been with them at La Vera Cruz, and came back
again before we came to an Account for the Goods which
I had brought on Shore in the 21 Bales, which by the Ac-
count we brought them to, leaving a Piece of every Thing
to be govern'd by our last Market, amounted to 8570
Pieces of Eight, all which Money my Friend, for so I
must now call him, brought me in Specie, and caused his
Negroes to pile them up in one Corner of my Apartment;
so that I was indeed, still very rich, all Things consider'd.
There was a Bale which I had caused to be pack'dup
on purpose in Virginia, and which indeed, I had written
for from England, being chiefly of fine English Broad-
Cloths, Silk, Silk-Druggets, and fine Stuffs of several
kinds, with some very fine Hollands, which I set apart
for Presents, as I should find Occasion; and as what ever
Hurry I was in at carrying the 21 Bales of Goods on
Shore, I did not forget to let this Bale be one of them, so
when we came to a Sale for the rest, I told them that this
was a Pack with Cloaths and Necessaries for my own
wearing and Use, and so desired it might not be open'd
with the rest, which was accordingly observ'd, and that
Bale or Pack was brought into my Apartment.
This Bale was in general, made up of several smaller
Bales, which I had directed so that I might have Room
to make Presents, equally sorted as the Circumstance
might direct me: However, they were all considerable,
and I reckon'd the whole Bale cost me near 200 /. Sterling
in England; and tho' my present Circumstances requir'd
some Limits to my Bounty in making Presents, yet the
Obligation I was under, being so much the greater, espe-
cially to this one friendly generous Spaniard, I thought I
could not do better than by opening two of the smaller
Bales join them together, and make my Gift something
suitable to the Benefactor, and to the Respect he had
shewn me; accordingly I took two Bales, and laying the
Goods together, the Contents were as follows.
Two Pieces of fine English Broad-Cloth, the finest that
could be got in London, divided as was that which I
gave to the Governor at the Havana, into fine Crim-
son in Grain, fine light Mixtures, and fine Black.
Four Pieces of fine Holland, of 7 s. to 8 s. per Ell in
London.
Twelve Pieces of fine Silk Drugget and Duroys, for
Men's Ware.
Six Pieces of Broad Silks, 2 Damasks, 2 Brocaded
Silks and 2 Mantuas.
With a Box of Ribbons, and a Box of Lace, the last cost
about 40 /. Sterling in England.
This handsome Parcel I laid open in my Apartment,
and brought him up Stairs one Morning, on Pretence to
drink Chocolate with me, which he ordinarily did; when
as we drank Chocolate, and was merry, I said to him, tho'
I had sold him almost all my Cargo, and taken his Money,
yet the Truth was, that I ought not to have sold them to
him, but to have laid them all at his Feet, for that it was to
his Direction I ow'd the having any Thing sav'd at all.
He smil'd, and with a great deal of Friendship in his
Face told me, that not to have paid me for them, would
have been to have plunder'd a Shipwreck, which had been
worse than to have robb'd an Hospital.
A-rlast I told him, I had two Requests to make to him,
which must not be deny'd. I told him, I had a small Pre-
sent to make to him, which I would give him a Reason
why he should not refuse to accept: And the second Re-
quest I would make after the first was granted. He said
he would have accepted my Present from me, if I had not
been under a Disaster, but as it was, it would be cruel and
ungenerous. But, I told him, he was oblig'd to hear my
Reason for his accepting it: Then I told him, that this
Parcel was made up for him by Name, by my Wife and I
in Virginia, and his Name set on the Marks of the Bale,
and accordingly I shew'd him the Marks, which was in-
deed on one of the Bales, but I had doubled it now, (as
above) so that I told him these were his own proper Goods;
and in short, I press'd him so to receive them, that he
made a Bow, and I said no more, but order'd my Negroe,
that is to say, his Negroe that waited on me, to carry them
all, except the two Boxes, into his Apartments, but would
not let him see the Particulars, till they were all carry'd
away.
After he was gone, about a Quarter of an Hour, he
came in raving, and almost swearing, and in a great Pas-
sion, but I could easily see he was exceedingly pleased;
and told me, had he known the Particulars, he would
never have suffer'd them to have gone as he did, and at
last used the very same Compliment that the Governor at
the Havana used, viz. that it was a Present fit for a Vice-
roy of Mexico, rather than for him.
When he had done, he then told me, he remember'd I
had two Requests to him, and that one was not to be told
till after the first was granted, and he hoped now I had
something to ask of him, that was equal to the Obliga-
tion I had laid upon him.
I told him, I knew it was not the Custom in Spain,ior&
Stranger to make Presents to the Ladies, and that I would
not in the least doubt, but that whatever the Ladies of his
Family requir'd, as proper for their Use, he would appro-
priate to them as he thought fit. But that there was two
little Boxes in the Parcel, which my Wife with her own
Hand had directed to the Ladies; and I begg'd he would
be pleas'd with his own Hand to give them in my Wife's
Name as directed; that I was only the Messenger, but
that I could not be honest, if I did not discharge the Trust
repos'd my self of.
These were the two Boxes of Ribbands and Lace,
which knowing the Nicety of the Ladies in Spain, or ra-
ther of the Spaniards, about their Women, I had made
my Wife pack up, and direct with her own Hand, as I
have said.
He smil'd, and told me it was true, the Spaniards did
not ordinarily admit so much Freedom among the Wo-
men, as other Nations; but he hop'd (he said) I would not
think the Spaniards thought all their Women Whores, or
that all Spaniards were jealous of their Wives: That as to
my Present, since he had agreed to accept of it, I should
have the Direction of what Part I pleas'd to his Wife and
Daughters; for he had three Daughters.
Here I strain'd Courtisies again, and told him by no
Means, I would direct nothing of that kind, I only begg'd
that he would with his own Hand present to his Donna, or
Lady, the Present design'dthem by my Wife, and that he
would present it in her Name now living in Virginia. He
was extreamly pleas'd with the Nicety I us'd, and I saw
him present it to her accordingly, and could see at the
opening of it, that she was extreamly pleas'd with the
Present itself, as indeed she might very well be; for in
that Country it was worth a very considerable Sum of
Money.
Tho' I was us'd with an uncommon Friendship before,
and nothing could well be desir'd more, yet the grateful
Sense I shew'd of it, in the Magnificence of this Present,
was not lost, and the whole Family appear'd sensible of
it; so that I must allow that Presents, where they can be
made in such a Manner, are not without their Influence,
where the Persons were not at all mercenary, either be-
fore or after.
I had here now a most happy and comfortable Retreat,
tho' it was a kind of an Exile; here I enjoy'd every Thing
I could think of, that was agreeable and pleasant, except
only a Liberty of going Home, which, for that Reason,
perhaps, was the only Thing I desir'd in the World; for
the Grierof one absent Comfort is oftentimes capable of
imbittering all the other Enjoyments in the World.
Here I enjoy'd the Moments which I had never before
known how to employ, I mean, that here I learn'd to look
back upon a long ill-spent Life, bless'd with infinite Ad-
vantage, which I had no Heart given me till now to make
use of, and here I found just Reflections were the utmost
Felicity of human Life.
Here I wrote these Memoirs, having to add, to the
Pleasure of looking back with due Reflections, the Bene-
fit of a violent Fit of the Gout, which, as it is allow'd by
by most People, clears the Head, restores the Memory,
and qualifies us to make the most, and just, and useful
Remarks upon our own Actions.
Perhaps, when I wrote these Things down, I did not
foresee that the Writings of our own Stories would be so
much the Fashion in England, or so agreeable to others
to read, as I find Custom, and the Humour of the Times
has caus'd it to be; if any one that reads my Story, pleases
to make the same just Reflections, which I acknowledge
I ought to have made, he will reap the Benefit of my Mis-
fortunes, perhaps, more than I have done myself; 'tis
evident by the long Series of Changes, and Turns, which
have appear'd in the narrow Compass of one private mean
Person's Life, that the History of Men's Lives may be
i| many Ways made useful and instructing to those who
read them, if moral and religious Improvement, and Re-
| flections are made by those that write them.
There remains many Things in the Course of this un-
happy Life of mine, tho' I have left so little a Part of it to
speak of, that are worth giving a large and distinct Ac-
count of, and which give Room for just Reflections of a
Kind which I have not made yet; particularly, I think it
just to add how, in collecting the various Changes and
Turns of my Affairs, I saw clearer than ever I had done
before, how an invincible over-ruling Power, a Hand in-
fluenced from above, governs all our Actions of every
Kind, limits all our Designs, and orders the Events of
every Thing relating to us.
And from this Observation it necessarily occurr'd to
me, how just it was, that we should pay the Homage of all
Events to him; that as he guided, and had even made the
Chain of Causes, and Consequences, which Nature in
general strictly obey'd, so to him should be given the
Honour of all Events, the Consequences of those Causes,
as the first Mover, and Maker of all Things.
I who had hitherto liv'd, as might be truly said, with-
out God in the World, began now to see farther into all
those Things, than I had ever yet been capable of before,
and this brought me at last to look with Shame and
Blushes upon such a Course of Wickedness, as I had gone
through in the World: I had been bred indeed to nothing
of either religious, or moral Knowledge; what I gain'd of
either, was first by the little Time of civil Life which I
liv'd in Scotland, where my Abhorrence of the Wicked-
ness of my Captain and Comrade, and some sober religi-
ous Company I fell into, first gave me some Knowledge
of Good and Evil, and shew'd me the Beauty of a sober,
religious Life, tho' with my leaving that Country, it soon
left me too; or secondly, the modest Hints, and just Re-
flections of my Steward, who I call'd my Tutor, who was
a Man of sincere Religion, good Principles, and a real
true Penitent for his past Miscarriages: O! had I with
him sincerely repented of what was past, I had not for
24 Years together liv'd a Life of Levity, and profligate
Wickedness after it.
BuThere I had (as I said) Leisure to reflect, and to re-
pent, and to call to Mind Things past, and with a just De-
testation learn, as Jobsays, to abhor myself inDusl and Ashes.
ItIs with this Temper that I have written my Story, I
would have all (that design to read it) prepare to do so
with the Temper of Penitents; and remember, with how
much Advantage they may make their penitent Reflec-
tions at Home, under the merciful Dispositions of Provi-
dence in Peace, Plenty, and Ease, rather than Abroad,
under the Discipline of a Transported Criminal; as my
Wife and my Tutor, or under the Miseries and Distresses
of a Shipwreck'd Wanderer, as my Skipper, or Captain
of the Sloop, who (as I hear) died a very great Penitent,
labouring in the Deserts and Mountains to find his Way
Home to Virginia, by the Way of Carolina, whither the
resl of the Crew reached, after infinite Dangers and Hard-
ships ; or in Exile, however favourably circumslanciated
as mine, in absence from my Family, and for some Time
in no probable View of ever seeing them any more.
Such (I say) may Repent with Advantage; but how
few are they that seriously look in, till their Way ishedg'd
up, and they have no other Way to look?
Here (I say) I had Leisure to Repent, how far it pleases
God to give the Grace of Repentance where he gives the
Opportunity of it, is not for me to say of my self; it is suf-
ficient that I recommend it to all that read this Story, that
when they find their Lives come up in any Degree to any
Similitude of Cases, they will enquire by me, and ask
themselves, Is not this the Time to Repent? Perhaps the
Answer may touch them.
I have only to add to what was then written, that my
kind Friend the Spaniards finding no other Method pre-
sented for conveying me to my Hope, that is to say, to
Virginia, got a Licence for me to come in the next Galeons,
as a Spanish Merchant to Cadiz, where I arriv'd safe with
all my Treasure, for he suffer'd me to be at no Expences
in his House; and from Cadiz, I soon got my Passage on
Board an English Merchant Ship for London, from whence
I sent an Account of my Adventures to my Wife, and
where, in about five Months more, she came over to me,
leaving with full Satisfaction the Management of all our
Affairs in Virginia, in the same faithful Hands as before.
FINIS.
and Proceedings of the late
JOHN GOW
alias Smith
Captain of the late Pirates, executed for Murther and
Piracy, committed on Board the GEORGE GALLY, after-
wards call'd the REVENGE; with a Relation of all
the horrid Murthers they committed in
cold Blood; as also of their being
taken at the Islands of Orkney,
and sent up Prisoners
to London.
one of the moil characlerislic of Defoe's minor writings, was
firslpublished as an oflavo pamphlet (pp. viii. and 62) by
J. Applebee, in Black Fryers, on June nth, i725. The
text, as here printed, has been carefully collated with the firsl
edition in the British Museum, and with the exception of afew
obvious printer's errors, which have been correcled, the spell-
ing andpuncluation of the original have been rigidlyfollowed.
HO' this WorkseemsprincipallytoenterintotheHislory
of one Man, namely, The late Captain John Gow, alias
Smith, the Leader or Commander in the desperate and
bloody Anionsfor which he has been Condemn'd; yet the Share
which several others had in the whole Scene, and whoacledin
Concertwithhim, comes so necessarily to be Describ'd and takes
upsoMuchroomintheRelation, that it may indeed becaWdthe
Hislory of all the late Pirates so far as they afted together in
these wicked Adventures.
NOR does the calling him {I mean this Gow, or Smith)
their Captain, denominate him any thing deeper in the Crime
than the resl; for 'tis eminently known that among such Fel-
lows as these, when once they have abandon'd themselves to
such a dreadful height of Wickedness, there is so little Govern-
ment or Subordination among them, that they are, on occasion,
all Captains, all Leaders. And tho' they generally put in this
or that Man to acl as Commanderforthisor that Voyage or En-
terprise, they frequently remove them again upon the smallesl
Occasion, nay, even without any Occasion at all, but as Hu-
mours and Passions govern at those Times: And this is done so
often, that I once knew a Buccaneering Pirate Vessel, whose
Crew were upwards of 70 Men, who, in one Voyage, had so
often changed, set up, and pull'd down their Captains and
other Officers, that above Seven-and-Forty of the Ships Com-
pany had, at several Times, been in Office of one kind or other;
and among the resl they had, in particular, had i3 Captains.
NOW, however, itwasnotsohere;yetitseems,eveninthis
Ship, Gow himself, tho' call'd Captain, had not an absolute
Command; and was, at one time, so insulted by Lieutenant
Williams, because he declin'd Attacking a French ship from
Martinico, that it wanted but little of Deposing him at that
Time, and murthering him too.

IN this Account, therefore, we shall have some Relation of
the Conducl of the whole Ships Crew, as well as of Captain
Gow; nor will it, I hope, make the Work the less Agreeable to
the Reader, but the more so, by how much the greater Variety
of Incidents will come in my way to speak of.
A S to Gow himself, he was, indeed, a Superlative, a Ca-
pital Rogue; and had been so even before he came to Embark
in this particular Ship. And he is more than ordinarily Re-
markable for havingformd the like Design of going a-Pirat-
ing when he serv'd as Boatswain on Board an English Mer-
chant Ship, Bound Home from Lisbon to London, in which
he formd a Party to have seiz'd on the Captain and Officers
and to run away with the Ship: When, no doubt, had he ac-
complish'd his Work, the said Captain and Officers had run
the same Fate as those did we are now to mention.
THISIam so ascertain'd of the Truth of, that the Cap-
tain himself is ready to Attesl it, to whom it was afterwards
discover'd, that he, Gow, had made four of the Seamen ac-
quainted with his bloody Design, and hadgain 'd them over to
it; But not being able to draw in any more, and notbeingslrong
enough with these who he had so Debauch'd, they did not make
their Attempt.
THIS, it seems, was not discover'd to the Captain till af-
ter the Ship was discharg'd in the Port of London, and the
Men paid off and dismiss'd; when Information being given,
the said Captain endeavour'd to have apprehended Gow and
his Accomplices; but having, (as 'twas supposed) gotten some
Notice of the Design, made off and shifted for themselves as
wellasthey could, in whichit was his Lot to go over to Holland.
HERE it was, viz., at Amsterdam, that Gow ship'd
himself afore the Mail, (as the seamen called it) that is to say,
as a Common Sailor, on Board an English Ship 0/200 Tons
Burden, called the George Galley. He ship'd himself at firsl,
as I have said, afore the Masl; but afterwards, which added
to the great Misfortune, appearingto be an activeskilful Sailor,
he obtain'd the Favour of being made Second Mate; the Ship
was Commanded by one Oliver Ferneau, a Frenchman, but
a Subjecl of Great Britain, being of the Island of Guernsey,
to which also did the Ship belong, but was then in theserviceof
the Merchants of Amsterdam.
CAP T A/iVFerneau, being aManofReputationamong
the Merchants at Amsterdam, got a Voyagefor his Ship from
thence to Santa Cruz, on the coasl of Barbary, to Load Bees
Wax, and to carry it to Genoa, whichwashisdeliveringPort;
and as the Dutch, having war with the Turks of Algiers,
were willing to employ him as an English Ship, so he was as
willing to be Mann'd with English Seamen; and according-
ly, among the resl, he unhappily took on Board this Gow with
his wretched Gang, such as Macaulay, Melvin, Williams,
and others; but not being able to Man themselves wholly with
English or Scots, they were oblig'd to take some Swedes and
other Seamen to make up his Compliment, which was 23 in
all; among the latter Sort one wasnam'd'Winter,andanother
Peterson, both of them Swedes by Nation, but as wicked, too,
as Gow and his other Fellows were.
THEY Sail'dfrom the Texel in the month of August
1724, and arrived at Santa Cruz on the 2nd of September
following, where, having a Supercargo on Board who took
Charge of the Loading andfour Chesls of Money to Purchase
it, they soon got the Bees Wax on Board, and on the 3rd of No-
vember they appointed to set Sail to pursue the Voyage.
THUS much seems, however, proper to signify to the
World, before they enter into the resl of Gow'j Story, because
ytis evidentfrom hence, that the late barbarous and inhuman
Action was not the Effecl of a sudden Fury rais'd in the Minds
of the whole Company by the ill Usage they had receiv'd from
vol. 11 m
Captain Ferneau in the Matter of their Provisions, or from
their having overheard the said Ferneau threaten them when
he spoke to the Mate, upon the Quarter Deck to get small Arms
into the great Cabbin, which they might suppose was in order
to seize on them, and bring them to Correclion, and so, in their
Heat of Blood, might run them up to such a height of Rage as
to commit the Murthers which they did not intend before.
B U T'tis evident that this Gow in particular, whatever
the resl might have done, had entertain'd this bloody Resolu-
tion in General (J mean of turning Pirate) long before this
Voyage; he had endeavour 'd to put it in praclice, at leasl once
before, namely, in the Ship {mentioned above) Bound from
Lisbon for London, and had only fail'd for want of being
able to bring over a sufficient Gang of Rogues to his Party;
whether he had not had the same Design in his Head long be-
fore, that we do not know; but it seems he had not been able to
bring it to pass till now, when finding some little Discontent
among the Men, on account of their Provisions, he was made
the Devil's Inslrument to run up those Discontents to such a
dreadful height of Fury and Rage as we shallfind they did,
AND tbisjuslly entitles Gow to the Charge of being the
Principal, as well Author as Agent, in the Tragedy that fol-
low'd. Nor does it at all take off the Charge that Winter and
Peterson began the mutinous Language towards the Captain.
T H E Design musl certainly have been laid among them
before; how else should so many of them so easily form such a
wicked Scheme in the few Minutes they had to talk together?
Gow therefore is, I say, juslly charg'd as Author of all the
wicked Conclusions among them, and as havingform'd a Re-
solution, in his own Mind to turn Pirate the fir si Time he had
an Opportunity, whatever Ship or whatever Voyage he went
upon.
CAPTAIN JOHN GOW
THE following Account being chiefly confin'd to
the Conduct of this outrageous Pirate, Captain
Gow, after his having actually turn'd Pirate, in
this particular Ship, the George Galley, we must content
ourselves with beginning where he began, that is to say,
when they seiz'd the Captain, murdered him and his
Men, and ran away with the Ship, on the coast of Barbary,
in the Mediterranean Sea.
It was the 3rd of November, Anno i724, when, as has
been observ'd, the Ship having lain two Months in the
Road at Santa Cruz, taking in her Lading, the Captain
made Preparations to put to Sea; and the usual Signalsfor
Sailing having been given, some of the Merchants from
on Shore, who had been concern'd in furnishing the Car-
go, came on Board in the Forenoon to take their Leave of
the Captain, and wish him a good Voyage, as is usual on
such Occasions.
Whether it was concerted by the whole Gang before-
hand we know not; but while the Captain was treating
and entertaining the Merchants under the Awning upon
the Quarter-Deck, as is the Custom in those hot Coun-
tries, three of the Seamen, viz. Winter and Peterson, two
Swedes, and Macaulay a Scotchman, came rudely upon the
Quarter-Deck, and as if they took that Opportunity be-
cause the Merchants were present, believing the Captain
would not use any Violence with them, in the presence of
the Merchants, they made a long Complaint of their ill
Usage, and particularly of their Provisions and Allow-
ance (as they said) being not sufficient, nor such as was
ordinarily made in other Merchant Ships; seeming to
load the Captain, Monsieur Ferneau, with being the Oc-
casion of it, and that he did it for his private Gain; which
however had not been true if the Fact had been true, the
Overplus of Provisions (if the stores had been more than
sufficient) belonging to the Owners, not to the Captain,
at the end of the Voyage; there being also a Steward on
Board to take the Account.
In their making this Complaint, they seem'd to direct
their speech to the Merchants, as well as to the Captain,
as if they had been concern'd in the Ship (which they were
not) or, as if desiring them to intercede for them with the
Captain, that they might have Redress, and might have a
better Allowance.
The Captain was highly provok'd atthis Rudeness,as,
indeed, hehadreason; it being a double Affront to him, as
it was done in the view of the Merchants who were come
on Board to him, and to do him an Honour at Parting;
however, he restrain'd his Passion, and gave them not the
least angry Word, only, that if they were aggriev'd, they
had no more to do, but to have let him know it, that if they
were ill used, it was not by his Order, that he would en-
quire into it, and that if anything was amiss, it should be
rectify'd; with which the Seamen withdrew, seemingwell
satisfied with his Answer.
About five the same Evening they unmoor'd the Ship,
and hove short upon their best bower Anchor, expecting
the Land Breeze, as is usual on that Coast, to carry them
out to Sea; but, instead of that, it fell stark Calm, and the
Captain fearing the Ship should fall foul of her own An-
chor, ordered the Mizzen-top Sail to be furl'd.
Peterson, one of the malcontent Seamen, being the
nearest Man at hand, seem'd to go about it, but mov'd so
carelessly, and heavily, that it appear'd plainly he did not
care whether it was done or no; and particularly as if he
had a mind the Captain should see it, and take Notice of
it; and the Captain did so, for perceiving how awkwardly
he went about it, he spoke a little tartly to him, and asked
him what was the reason he did not stir a little and furl the
Sail.
Peterson, as if he waited for the Question, answered
in a surly Tone, and with a kind of Disdain, "So as we eat
so shall we work" This he spoke aloud, so as thathemight
be sure the Captain should hear him, and the rest of the
Men also; and 'twas evident, that as he spokeintheplural
Number We, so he spoke their Minds as well as his Own,
and Words which they had all agreed to before.
The Captain, however, tho' he heard plain enough
what he said, took not the least Notice of it, or gave him
the least room to believe he had heard him, beingnot will-
ing to begin a Quarrel with the Men, and knowing that if
he took any Notice at all of it, he must resent itand punish
it too.
Soon after this the Calm wentoff,andtheLand-Breeze
sprung up, as is usual on that Coast, and they immediately
weigh'd and stood off to Sea; but the Captain having had
those two Ruffles with his Men, just at their putting to
Sea, was very uneasy in his Mind, as, indeed, he had rea-
son to be; and the same Evening, soon after they were
under Sail, the Mate being walking on the QuarterDeck,
he went, and taking twoor three Turnswith him, toldhim
how he had been us'd by the Men, particularly how they
affronted him before the Merchants, and whatan Answer
Peterson had given him on the Quarter-Deck when he or-
dered him to furl the Mizen-top Sail.
The mate was surpriz'd at the Thing as well as the
Captain, and after some other Discourse about it,in which
'twas their Unhappiness not to be so private as they ought to
have been in a Case of such Importance, theCaptain toldhim
he thought it was absolutely necessary to have a Quantity
of small Arms brought immediately into the great Cab-
bin, not only to defend themselves if there should be oc-
casion, but also that he might be in a Posture to correct
those Fellows for their Insolence, especially if he should
meet with any more of it: The Mate agreed that it was
necessary to be done, and had they said no more, and said
this more privately all had been well, and the wicked De-
sign had been much more difficult, if not the execution of
it effectually prevented.
But two Mistakes in this Part was the ruin of them all:
(1) That the Captain spoke it without due Caution, so
that Winter'and Peterson, the two principal Malcontents,
and who were expressly mentioned by the Captain to be
corrected, overheard it, and knew by that Means what
they had to expect, if they did not immediately bestir
themselves to prevent it. (2) The other Mistake was that
when the Captain and Mate agreed that it was necessary
to have the Arms got ready and brought into the great
Cabbin, the Captain unhappily bade him go immediately
to Gow, the second Mate and Gunner, and give him Or-
ders to get the Arms cleared and loaded for him, and so to
bring them up to the great Cabbin, which was, in short,
to tell the Conspirators that the Captain was preparing to
be too strong for them if they did not fall to work with
him immediately.
Winter and P^/mo«wentimmediately Forward, where
they knew the reft of the Mutineers were, and to whom
they communicated what they had heard; telling them
that it was time to provide for their own Safety, for other-
wise their Destruction was resolv'd on, and the Captain,
would soon be in such a Posture that there would be no
meddling with him.
While they were thus consulting at first, as they said,
only for their own Safety, Gow and Williams came in to
them, with some others, to the Number of eight; and no
sooner were they joined by these two, but they fell down-
right to the Point, which Gow had so long form'd in his
own Mind, (viz.) to seize upon the Captain and Mate,
and all those that they could not bring to joyn with them;
in short, to throw them into the Sea, and to go upon the Ac-
count.
All those who are acquainted with the Sea Language
know the Meaning of that Expression, and that it is, in
few Words, to run away with the Ship and turn Pirates.
Villainous Designs are soonest concluded; as they
had but little Time to consult upon what Measures they
should take, so a very little Consultation serv'd for what
was before them, and they came to this short but hellish
Resolution, (viz.) Thatthey wouldimmediately, that very
Night, murther the Captain, and such others as they
nam'd, and afterwards proceed with the Ship as they
should see Cause.
And here it is to be observ'd, that tho' Winter and Pe-
terson were in the first Proposal, namely, to prevent their
being brought to Correction by the Captain, yet Gow and
Williams were the principal Advisers in the bloody Part,
which, however, the rest soon came into; for, as I said be-
fore, as they had but little Time to resolve it: so they had
but very little Debate about it; but what was first propos'd
was forthwith engag'd in and consented to.
Bes1des, it must not be omitted that, as I have said, up-
on good Grounds, that Gow had always had the wicked
Game of Pirating in his Head, and that he had attempted
it, or rather try'd to attempt it, before, but was not able to
bring it to pass: So he had, and Williams also had several
times, even in this very Voyage, dropt some hints of this
vile Design, as they thought there was Room for it; and
touch'd two or three Times at what a noble Opportunity
they had of Enriching themselves, and making their For-
tunes, as they wickedly call'd it: This was when they had
the four Chests of Money on Board; and Williams made
it a kind of a Jest in his Discourse how easily they might
carry it off, Ship and all: But as they did not find them-
selves Seconded, or that any of the Men shewed them-
selves in favour of such a thing, but rather spoke of it with
Abhorrence, they pass'd it over as a kind of Discourse
that had nothing at all in it; except that one of the Men,
(viz.) the Surgeon, took them up short once, for so much
as mentioning such a Thing, told them the Thought was
Criminal, and it ought not to be spoken of among them.
Which Reproof, 'twas suppos'd, cost him his Life after-
wards.
As Gow and his Comrade had thus started the Thing
at a Distance before, though it was then without Success,
yet they had the Less to do now, when other Discontents
had rais'd a secret Fire in the Breasts of the Men; for now
being, as it were, Mad and Desperate, with Apprehen-
sions of their beingto be severely Punish'dby the Captain,
they wanted no Perswasions to come into the most wicked
Undertaking that the Devil, or any of his Agents could
propose to them. Nor do we find, that upon any of their
Examinations they pretended to have made any Scruples
of, or Objections against the Cruelty of the bloody At-
tempt that was to be made, but came into it at once, and
resolved to put it in Execution immediately, that is to say,
the very same Evening.
It was the Captain's constant Custom to call all the
Ship's Company every Night, at Eight a'Clock, into the
Great Cabbin to prayers; and then the Watch being set,
one Watch went upon Deck, and the other turn'd in (as
the Seamen call it), that is, went to their Hammocks to
Sleep; And here they concerted their devilish Plot. It was
the Turn of five of the Conspirators to go to Sleep, and of
these, Goto and Williams, were two; the three, who were
to be upon the Deck, were Winter, Rolson, and Melvin a
Scotchman.
The Persons they had immediately design'd for De-
struction, were four, (viz.) the Captain, the Mate, the
Super Cargo, and the Surgeon, whereof all, but the Cap-
tain, were gone to Sleep; the Captain himself being upon
the Quarter-Deck.
Between Nine and Ten at Night, all being quiet and
secure, and the poor Gentlemen, that were to be mur-
ther'd fast asleep, the Villains that were below, gave the
Watch-Word, which was, "who Fires next?" at which
they all got out of their Hammocks with as little Noise as
they could, and going, in the Dark, to the Hammocks of
the Chief Mate, Super Cargo, and Surgeon, they cut all
their Throats; the Surgeon's Throat was cut so effectual-
ly, that he could struggle very little with them, but leaping
out of his Hammock, ran up to get upon the Deck, hold-
ing his Hand upon his Throat, but stumbled at the Tiller,
and falling down, had no Breath, and consequently no
Strength, to raise himself, but dy'd where he lay.
The Mate, whose Throat was cut, but not his Wind-
pipe, had struggled so Vigorously with the Villain, that
attempted him that he got from him, and got into the
Hold; and the Super Cargo, in the same Condition, got
forwards between Decks, under some Deals, and both of
them begg'd, with the most moving Cries and Intreaties,
for their Lives; and when nothing could prevail, they
beg'd with the same earnestness, but for a few Moments
to Pray to God, and Recommend their Souls to His Mer-
cy ; but alike in Vain, for the wretched Murtherers, heated
with Blood, were pass'd all Pitty; and not being able to
come at them with their Knives, with which they had be-
gun the Execution, they shot them with their Pistols,
Firing several times upon each of them, till they found
they were quite dead.
As all this, before the Firings, could not be done with-
out some Noise, the Captain, who was walking alone up-
on the Quarter-Deck, call'd out and ask'd, what was the
Matter? The Boatswain, who sat on the After Bits, and
was not of the Party, answer'd He could not tell; but was
afraid there was some Body Over-board; upon which the
Captain step'd toward the Ships Side to look over, when
Winter, Rowlinson, and Melvin, coming that moment be-
hind him, lay'd Hands on him, and lifting him up, at once
attempted to throw him Overboard into the Sea; but he
being a nimble, strong Man, got hold of the Shrouds, and
struggled so hard with them, that they could not break
his Hold; but turning his Head, to look behind him, to
see who he had to deal with, one of them cut his Throat
with a broad Dutch Knife, but neither was that Wound
Mortal: And the Captain still struggled with them, tho'
seeing he should undoubtedly be Murthered, he con-
stantly cry'd out to God for Mercy, for he found there
was no Mercy to be expected from them: During this
Struggle, another of the Murtherers stab'd him with a
Knife in the Back, and that with such Force, that the Vil-
lain could not draw the Knife out again to repeat his
Blow, which he would otherwise have done.
At this Moment Gow came up from the Butchery he
had been at between Decks, and seeing the Captain still
alive, he went close up to him and shot him (as he con-
fess'd) with a Brace of Bullets.
What Part he shot him into, could not be known; tho'
they said he shot him into the Head; however, he had yet
Life enough, tho' they threw him Over-board, to take
hold of a Rope, and would still have saved himself, but
they cut that Rope, and he fell into the Sea, and was seen
no more. Thus they finished the Tragedy, having mur-
thered four of the principal Men of Command in the
Ship, so that there was now no Body to Oppose them; for
Gow being Second Mate and Gunner, the Command fell
to him of Course, and the rest of the Men having no Arms
ready, nor knowing how to get at any, were in the utmost
Consternation, expecting they would go on with the
Work and cut all their Throats.
In this Fright every one shifted for himself; as for
those who were upon Deck, some got into the Round
Tops, others got into the Ship's Head, resolving to throw
themselves into the Sea rather than to be mangled with
Knives, and murthered in Cold Blood, as the Captain and
Mate, &c, had been; Those who were below, not know-
ing what to do, or whose Turn it should be next, lay still
in their Hammocks, expecting Death every Moment;
and not daring to stir, least the Villains should think they
did it in order to make Resistance, which however they
were no way capable of doing, having no Concert one
with another, nor knowing any Thing in Particular of
one another, as who was Alive or who was Dead; whereas
had the Captain, who was himself a bold and stout Man,
been in his Great Cabbin with three or four Men with
him, and his Fire-Arms, as he intended to have had,those
eight Fellows had never been Able to have done their
Work; but every Man was taken Unprovided, and in the
utmost Surprise, so that the Murtherers met with no Re-
sistance: And as for those that were left, they were less
Able to make Resistance than the other; so that, as I have
said, they were in the utmost Terror and Amazement,
expecting every Minute to be Murthered as the rest had
been.
But the Villains had done: The Persons who had any
Command, were Dispatch'd, so they Cool'd a little as to
Blood. The first Thing they did afterward, was to call up
all the Eight upon the Quarter-Deck, where they Con-
gratulatedone another, andshookHands together engag-
ing to proceed, by unanimous Consent, in their resolved
Design, that is to say, of turning Pirates; in Order to
which, they with a Nem. Con., chose Gow to Command
the Ship, promising all Subjection and Obedience to his
Orders (so that now we must call him Captain Gow) and
he, by the same Consent of the rest, named Williams to be
his Lieutenant. Other Officers they appointed afterwards.
The first Order they issued, was to let all the rest of the
Men know, that if they continued Quiet, and offer'd not
to Meddle with any of their Affairs, they should receive
no Hurt; but strictly forbid any Man among them to set
a Foot Abaft the Main-mast, except they were call'd to
the Helm, upon pain of being immediately cut in Pieces;
keeping, for thatPurpose, one Man at the Steerage-door,
and one upon the Quarter-deck, with drawn Cutlasses in
their Hands; but there was no need for it, for the Men
were so terrified with the bloody Doings they had seen,
that theynever offer'dto come in sighttill they were call'd.
Their next Work was to throw the three dead Bodies,
of the Mate, the Surgeon, and the Super Cargo over
Board, which, they said, lay in their Way, and that was
soon done, their Pockets first search'd and rifled. From
thence they went to work with the Great Cabbin and with
all the Lockers, Chests, Boxes, and Trunks; These they
Broke open and Rifled, that is, such of them as belong'd
to themurtheredPersons ;andwhatevertheyfound there,
they shar'd amongthemselves: When they had done this,
they call'd for Liquor, and sat down to Drinking till
Morning, leaving the Men (as above) to keep Guard, and
particularly to guard the Arms, but Relieved them from
Time to Time as they saw Occasion.
By this Time they had drawn in four more of the Men
to approve of what they had done, and promise to Joyn
with them, so that now they were twelve in Number, and
being but 24 at first:, whereof four were Murthered, they
had but eight Men to be Apprehensive of, and those they
could easily look after; so for the next Day they sent for
them all to appear before their new Captain, where they
were told by Gow, what his Resolution was, viz., to go a
Cruising, or to go upon the Account (as above) that if they
were willing to Joyn with them, and go into their Mea-
sures, they should be well used, and there should be no
Distinction among them, but they should all fare alike;
that they had been forced by the barbarous Usage of Fer-
neau to do what they had done, but that now there was no
looking back; and therefore as they had not been con-
cern'd in what was past, they had nothing to do but to act
in Concert, do their Duty as Sailors, and obey Orders for
the good of the Ship, and no Harm should he do to any of
them.
As they all looked like condemn'd Prisoners brought
up to the Bar to receive Sentence of Death, so they all an-
swer'd by a profound Silence; not one Word being said
by any of them, which Gow took, as they meant it, (viz.,)
for a Consent, because they durst not refuse; so they were
then permitted to go up and down every where as they
used to do. Tho' such of them as sometimes afterwards
showed any Reluctance to adt as Principals, were never
Trusted, always Suspected, and often severely Beaten,
and some of them were many ways inhumanly Treated,
and that particularly by Williams, the Lieutenant, who
was, in his Nature a merciless, cruel, and inexorable
Wretch, as we shall have occasion to take Notice of again
in its Place.
They were now in a new Circumstance of Life, and
acting upon a different Stage of Business, tho' upon the
same Stage as to the Element, the Water; before, they
were a Merchant Ship, loaden upon a good Account with
Merchants Goods from the Coast of Barbary, and bound
to the Coast of Italy: But they were now a Crew of Pirates,
or, as they call them in the Levant, Corsaires, Bound no
where, but to look out for Purchase and Spoil wherever
they could find it.
In pursuit of this wicked Trade, they first chang'd the
Name of the Ship, which was before called the George
Gaily, and which they call now the Revenge, a Name in-
deed suitable to the bloody Steps they had taken: In the
next place, they made the best of the Ships Forces: The
Ship had but twelve Guns mounted when they came out
of Holland; but as they had six more good Guns in the
Hold, with Carriages and every Thing proper for Service
(which they had in Store, because being Freighted for the
Dutch Merchants, and the Algerines being at War with
the Hutch, they suppos'd they might want them for De-
fence); Now they took care to Mount them for a much
worse Design; so that now they had 18 Guns, tho' too
many for the number of Hands they had on Board.
In the third Place, instead of pursuing their Voyage to
Genoa with the Ships Cargo, they took a clear contrary
Course, and resolv'd to Station themselves upon the
Coasts of Spain and Portugal, and to Cruise upon all Na-
tions; but what they chiefly aim'd at, was a Ship with
Wine, if possible, for that they wanted Extreamly.
The first Prize they took was an English Sloop belong-
ing to Pool, Thomas Wise, Commander, bound fromNew-
foundlandwitb. Fish forCadiz: This was aPrize of no Value
to them, for they knew not what to do with the Fish; so
they took out the Master, Mr. Wise, and his Men, who
were but Five in Number, with their Anchors, and Cables,
and Sails, and what else they found worth taking out, and
sunk the Vessel.
N.B.—Here, it is to be observ'd, theyfound a Man veryfit
for their Turn, one James Belvin, he was Boatswain of the
Sloop, a slout, brisk Fellow, and a very good Sailor, but other-
ways wicked enough to suit with their Occasion, and as soon
as he came among them he discover1 d it;fortho' he was not in
the firsl bloody Contrivance, nor in the terrible Execution of
which I have given a Relation, that is to say, he was not guilty
of running away with the Ship George Gaily, nor of mur-
thering the four Innocent Men, which we have given an
Account of above; yet 'tis Evident he joyn'd Heartily in
all the Villainies which follow'd. And, indeed, this Man's
Fate is a just and needful Caution to all those Sailors, who
being taken in other Ships by the Pirates, think that is a
sufficient Plea for them to act as real Pirates afterwards;
and that the Plea or Pretence of being Forced, will be a
sufficient Protection to them, however Guilty they may
have been afterward, and however Volunteer they may
have Acted when they came among the Pirates.
Doubtless 'tis possible for a Man to prove a hearty
Rogue after he is forced into the Service of the Pirates,
however Honest he was before, and however Undesign-
edly or against his Consent he at first came among them:
Therefore those who expect to be Acquitted in a Court of
Justice afterward on Pretence of their being at first Forced
into the Company of Rogues, must take care not to act
anything in Concert with them while they are Embark'd
together, but what they really cannot Avoid, and are ap-
parently under a Constraint in the doing.
But this Man, 'twas plain, acted a quite different Part;
for after he took on with them, he took all Occasions to
engage their Confidence, and to convince them that he
was Hearty in his Joyning them. In a Word, he was the
most active and vigorous Fellow of any that were, as it
may be said, forc'd into their Service; for many of the
others, tho' they acted with them, and were apparently
Assisting, yet there was always a kind of Backwardness
and Disgust at the Villainy, for which they were often
maltreated, and always suspected by their Masters.
The next Prize they took was a Scotch Vessel, bound
from Glassgow, with Herrings and Salmon, from thence
to Genoa, and commanded by one Mr John Somerville,
of Port Patrick. This Vessel was likewise of little Value to
them, except that they took out, as they had done from
the other, their Arms, Ammunition, Cloths, Provisions,
Sails, Anchors, Cables, &c, and every Thing of Value,
and therefore they sunk her too, as they had done the
Sloop. The Reason they gave for sinking these two Ves-
sels was to prevent their being Discover'd; for as they
were now Cruising on the Coast of Portugal, had they let
the Ships have gone with several of their Men on Board,
they would presently have stood in for the Shore, and have
given the Alarm; and the Men of War, of which there
were several, as well Dutch as English, in the River of Lis-
bon, would presently have put out to Sea in Quest of them;
And they were very unwilling to leave the Coast of Portu-
gal till they had got a Ship with Wine, which they very
much wanted.
They Cruised eight or ten Days after this without see-
ing so much as one Vessel upon the Seas, and were just
resolving to stand more to the Norward, to the Coast of
Gallitia, when they descry'd a Sail to theSouthward, being
a Ship about as big as their own, tho' they could not per-
ceive what Force she had; however, they gave Chase, and
the Vessel perceiving it, crouded from them with all the
Sail they could make, hoisting up French Colours, and
standing away to the Southward.
vol. 11 n
Th ey continued the Chase three Days and three Nights,
and though they did not gain much upon her, the French-
man Sailing very well, yet they kept her in sight all the
while, and for the most part within Gun-shot. But the
third Night, the Weather proving a little Haizy, the
Frenchman chang'd his Course in the Night, and so got
clear of them, and good Reason they had to bless them-
selves in the Escape they had made: If they had but known
what a dreadful Crew of Rogues they had fallen among,
if they had been taken.
They were now gotten a long Way to the Southward,
and being greatly Disappointed, and in want of Water as
well as Wine, they resolved to stand away for the Maderas,
which they knew was not far off, so they accordingly made
the Island in two Days more, and keeping a large Offing,
they Cruiz'd for three or four Days more, expecting to
meet with some Portuguese Vessel going in or coming out;
but 'twas in Vain, for nothing stirr'd: So, tir'd with Ex-
pecting, they stood in for the Road, and came to an An-
chor, tho' at a great Distance; then they sent their Boat
towards the Shore with seven Men, all well arm'd, to see
whether it might not be Practicable to Board one of the
Ships in the Road, andcuttingheraway from her Anchors,
bring her off; or if they found that could not be done, then
their Orders were to Intercept some of the Boats belong-
ing to the Place, which carry Wines off on Board the Ships
in the Road, or from one Place to another on the Coast;
but they came back again disappointed in both, every
Body being allarm'd and aware of them, knowing by their
Posture what they were.
Having thus spent several Days to no Purpose, and
finding themselves Discover'd (at length being apparent-
ly under a Necessity to make an Attempt some where),
they stood away for Porto Santa, about ten Leagues to the
windward of Maderas, and belonging also to the Portu-
guese; here putting up British Colours, they sent their
Boat ashore with Captain Somervills Bill of Health, and a
present to the Governour of three Barrels of Salmon and
six Barrels of Herrings, and a very civil Message, desir-
ing leave to Water, and to buy some Refreshments, pre-
tending to be Bound to .
The Governour very courteously granted their Desire,
but with more Courtesy than Discretion, went off him-
self, with about Nine or ten of his principal People, to pay
the English Captain a Visit, little thinking what a kind of
a Captain it was they were going to Compliment, and
what Price it might have Cost them.
However Gow, handsomely dress'd, receiv'd them
with some Ceremony,and entertain'd them tollerably
well for a while; but the Governour having been kept as
long by Civillity as they could, and the Refreshments
from the Shore not appearing, he was forced to Unmask;
and when the Governour and his Company rose up to
take their leave, they were, to their great Surprize, sud-
denly surrounded with a gang of Fellows with Musquets
and an Officer at the Head of them, who told them, in so
many Words, they were the Captains Prisoners, and must
not think of going on Shore any more till the Water and
Provisions which were promis'd should come on Board.
It is impossible to conceive the Consternation and Sur-
prize the Portuguese Gentry were in; nor is it very Decent-
ly to be express'd; the poor Governour was so much more
than half Dead with the Fright that he really Befoul'd
himself in a piteous Manner; and the rest were in no much
better Condition; they trembled, cry'd, begg'd, cross'd,
themselves, and said their Prayers as Men going to Exe-
cution ; but 'twas all one, they were told flatly the Captain
was not to be Trifled with, that the Ship was in want of
Provisions, and they would have them, or they would car-
ry them all away: They were however well enough Treat-
ed, except the Restraint of their Persons, and were often
ask'd to Refresh themselves, but they would neither Eat
or Drink any more all the while they stay'd on Board,
which was till the next Day in the Evening, when to their
great Satisfaction they saw a great Boat come off"from the
Fort, and which came directly on Board with seven Buts
of Water, a Cow and a Calf, and a good number of Fowls.
When the Boat came on Board, and had delivered the
Stores, Captain Gow Complimented the Governour and
his Gentlemen, and discharg'd them to their great Joy;
and besides discharging them, he gave them, in return
for the Provisions they brought, two Cerons of Bees Wax,
and fir'd them three guns at their going away. I suppose,
however, they will have a care how they go on Board of
any Ship again in Compliment to their Captain, unless
they are very sure who they are.
Having had no better Success in this out of the way
run to the Maderas, they resolved to make the best of their
way back again to the Coast of Spain or Portugal. They
accordingly left Porto Santa the next Morning, with a
fair Wind, standing directly for Cape St Vincent or the
Southward. Cape.
They had not been upon the Coast of Spain above two
or three Days before they met with a New England Ship,
Cross Commander, laden with Staves, and bound
for Lisbon, and being to Load there with Wine for Lon-
don; this was a Prize also of no Value to them, and they
began to be very much discouraged with their bad For-
tune. However, they took out Captain Cross and his men,
which were seven or eight in Number, with most of the
Provisions and some of the Sails, and gave the Ship to
Captain Wise, the Pool man who they took at first in a
Sloop from Newfoundland; and in order to pay Wise and
his Men for what he took from them, and make them Sa-
tisfaction, as he call'd it, he gave to Captain Wise, and his
Mate 24 Cerons of Bees Wax, and to each of his Men,
who were four in Number, two Cerons of Wax each;
thus he pretended honestly, and to make Reparation of
Damages by giving them the Goods which he had robb'd
the Dutch Merchants of, whose Super-Cargo he had
Murthered.
After this, Cruising some Days off of the Bay, they
met with a French Ship from Cadiz, laden with Wine,
Oyl, and Fruit; this was, in some respect, the very Thing
they wanted; so they Mann'd her with their own Men
and stood off to Sea, that they might divide the Spoil of
her with more Safety, for they were too near the Land.
And first they took out the French Master and all his
Men, which were twelve in Number; then they shifted
great Part of the Cargo, especially of the Wine, with some
Oyl and a large quantity of Almonds, out of the French
Ship into their own; with five of his best Guns, and their
Carriages, all their Ammunition and small Arms, and all
the best of their Sails, and then he gave that Ship to Cap-
tain Somerville, the Glasgow Captain, whose Ship they had
sunk, and to Captain Cross, the New England Captain,
who they had taken but just before; and to do Justice, as
they call'd it, here also, they gave half the Ship and Cargo
to Somerville, onequarterto his Mate, and the other quar-
ter to Captain Cross, and 16 Cerons of Wax to the Men to
be shar'd among them.
It is to be observ'd here that Captain Somerville carried
all his Men along with him, except one who chose to en-
ter among the Pirates, so that he cou'd never pretend he
was forced into their Service; but Cross's men were all
detain'd, whether by Force or by their own Consent, does
not appear at present.
The Day before this Division of the Spoil they saw a
large Ship to Windward, which at first put them into
some Surprize, for she came bearing down directly upon
them, and they thought she had been a Portuguese Man
of War; but they found soon after that it was a Merchant
Ship, had French Colours, and bound Home, as they sup-
pos'd, from the Wesl Indies ; andit was so, for, as we after-
wards learn'd, she was loaded at Martinico, and bound for
Rochelle.
The Frenchman, not fearing them, came on large to the
Wind, being a Ship of much greater Force than Gow's
ship, and carrying 32 Guns and 80 Men, besides a great
many Passengers; however Gow at first made as if he
would lye by for them; but seeing plainly what a Ship it
was, and that they should have their Hands full of her, he
began to consider, and calling his Men all together upon
the Deck, told them his Mind (viz.) That the Frenchman
was apparently superior in Force every way, that they
were but ill-mann'd, and had a great many Prisoners on
Board, and that some of their own People were not very
well to be trusted; that six of their best Hands were on
Board the Prize, and that all they had left were not suffici-
ent to ply their Guns and stand by the Sails; and that
therefore, as they were under no Necessity to engage, so
he thought it would be next to Madness to think of it, the
French Ship beingso very much Superior to themin Force.
The Generallity of the Men were of Gow's Mind, and
agreed to decline the Fight; but Williams, his Lieut.,
strenuously oppos'd it, and being not to be appeas'd by
all that Gow could say to him, or any one else, flew out in
a Rage at Gow, upbraiding him with being a Coward, and
not fit to command a Ship of Force.
The Truth is, Gow's Reasoning was Good, and the
Thing was Just, considering their own Condition. But
Williams was a Fellow uncapable of any solid Thinking,
had a kind of a savage, brutal Courage, but nothing of
true Bravery in him; and this made him the most despe-
rate and outrageous Villain in the World, and the most
cruel and inhuman to those whose Disaster it was to fall
into his Hands, as had frequently appear'd in his Usage
of the Prisoners, under his Power in this very Voyage.
Gow was a Man of Temper, and notwithstanding all
ill Language Williams gave him, said little or nothing,
but by way of Argument, against attacking the French
Ship, which would certainly have been too strong for
them: But this provok'd Williams the more, and he grew
to such an extravagant height, that he demanded boldly
of Gow to give his Orders for Fighting, which Gow de -
clining still, Williams presented his Pistol at him, and
snapt it, but it did not go off", which enrag'd him the more.
W1nter and Peterson, standing nearest to Williams,
and seeing him so furious, flew at him immediately, and
each of them fir'd a Pistol at him; one shot him thro' the
Arm, and the other into his Belly, at which he fell, and the
Men about him laid hold of him tothrowhim Over-board,
believing he was dead; but as they lifted him up, he start-
ed violently out of their Hands, and leaped directly into
the Hold, and from thence ran desperately into the Pow-
der-Room, with his Pistol cock'd in his Hand, swearing
he would blow them all up; and had certainly done it, if
they had not seiz'd him just as he had gotten the Scuttle
open, and was that Moment going in to put his hellish
Resolution into practice.
Hav1ng thus secur'd the demented, raving Creature,
they carryed him forward to the Place which they had
made on Purpose, between Decks, to secure their Pri-
soners, and put him in amongst them, having first loaded
him with Irons, and particularly Hand-cuffed him with
his Hands behind him, to the great Satisfaction of the
other Prisoners, who, knowing what a butcherly, furious
Fellow he was, were terrified, to the last Degree, to see
him come in among them, till they saw the Condition he
came in. He was, indeed, the Terror of all the Prisoners,
for he usually treated them in a barbarous manner, with-
out the least Provocation, and meerly for his Humour,
presenting Pistols to their Breasts, swearing he would
shoot them that Moment, and then would beat them un-
mercifully, and all for his Diversion, as he call'd it.
Hav1ng thus laid him fast, they presently resolv'd to
stand away to the Weslward, by which they quitted the
Martinico Ship, who by that time was come nearer to them,
and farther convinc'd them they were in no Condition to
have Engag'd her, for she was a stout Ship, and full of
Men.
All this happen'd just the Day before they shar'd their
last Prize among the Prisoners (as I have said), in which
theyputonsucha Mock-face of doing Justice to the sever-
al Captains and Mates, and other Men, their Prisoners,
whose Ships they had taken away, and who now they
made a Reparation to by giving them what they had taken
Violently from another, that it was a strange Medly of
Mock-Justice made up of Rapine and Generosity blend-
ed together.
Two Days after this they took a Brislol Ship, bound
from Newfoundland to Oporto with Fish; they let her Car-
go alone, for they had no occasion for Fish, but they took
out also almost all their Provisions, all the Ammunition,
Arms, &c, all her good Sails, also her best Cables, and
forced two of her Men to go away with them, and then
put 1 o of the French Men on Board her, and let her go.
But just as they were parting with her, they consulted
together what to do with Williams their Lieutenant, who
was then among their Prisoners, and in Irons; and after a
short Debate they resolv'd to put him on Board the Brislol
Man and send himaway too, whichaccordingly was done;
with Directions to the Master to deliver him on Board the
first English Man of War they should meet with, in order
to his being hang'd for a Pirate (so they Jeeringly call'd
him) as soon as he came to England, giving them also an
account of some of his Villainies.
The truth is, this Williams was a Monster, rather than
a Man; he was the most inhuman, bloody, and desperate
Creature that the World could produce; he was even too
wicked for Gow and all his Crew, tho' they were Pirates
and Murtherers, as has been said; his temper was so Sav-
age, so Villainous, so Merciless, that even the Pirates
themselves told him it was Time he was hang'd out of the
Way.
One Instance of this Barbarity in Williams can not be
omitted, and will be sufficient to justify all that can be said
of him, namely, thatwhen Gowgave it as a Reason against
engaging with the Martinico Ship, that he had a great
many Prisoners on Board, (as above) and some of their
own Men they couldnot depend upon; Williamspropos'd
to have them all call'd up, one by one, and to cut their
Throats and throw them Overboard; A proposal so Hor-
rid, that the worst of the Crew shook their Heads at it; yet
Gow answer'd him very handsomly, That there had been
too much Blood spilt already; yet the refusing this highten'd
the Quarrel, and was the chief Occasion of his offering to
Pistol Gow himself, as has been said at large: After which
his Behaviour was such, as made all the Ships Crew re-
solved to be rid of him. And 'twas thought, if they had not
had an Opportunity to send him away, as they did by the
Bristol Ship, they would have been oblig'd to have hang'd
him themselves.
This cruel and butcherly Temper of Williams being
carry'd to such a height, so near to the ruine of them all,
shock'd some of them, and, as they acknowledg'd, gave
them some check in the heat of their wicked Progress,
and had they had a fair Opportunity to have gone on shore
at the Time, without falling into the Hands of Justice,
'tis believed the greatest Part of them would have aban-
don'd the Ship, and perhaps the very trade of a Pirate too.
But they had dipt their Hands in Blood, and Heaven had
no doubt determin'd to bring them, that is to say, the Chief
of them, to the Gallows for it, as indeed they all deserv'd;
so they went on.
When they put Williams on board the Brislol Man,
and he was told what Directions they gave with him, he
began to relent, and made all the Intercession he could to
Captain Gow for Pardon, or at least not to be put on board
the Ship, knowing if he was carried to Lisbon, he should
meet with his Due from the Portuguese if not from the
English; for it seems he had been concern'd in some Vil-
lainies among the Portuguese, before he came on board
the George Galley, what they were he did not confess, nor
indeed did his own Ship's Crew trouble themselves to
examine him aboutit:Hehadbeenwickedenough among
them, and it was sufficient to make them use him as they
did; it was more to be wonder'd, indeed, they did not cut
him in pieces upon the Spot, and throw him into the Sea,
half on one side of the Ship, and half ontheother; for there
was scarce a Man in the Ship, but on one Occasion or
other, had some apprehensions of him, and might be said
to go in danger of his Life from him.
But they chose to shift their Hands of him this blood-
less way; so they double-fetter'd him and brought him
up: When they brought him out among the Men, he
begg'd they would throw him into the Sea and drown
him; then entreated for his Life with a meanness which
made them dispisehim, and with Tears, so that one Time
they began to relent; butthen the devilish Temper of the
fellow overruled it again; so at last they resolv'd to let him
go, and did accordingly put him on Board, and gave him
a hearty Curse at parting, wishing him a good Voyage to
the Gallows, as was made good afterwards, tho' in such
Company as they little thought of at that Time.
The Brislol Captain was very just to them, for, accord-
ing to their Orders, as soon as they came to Lisbon, they
put him on Board the Argyle, one of his Majesty's Ships,
Captain Bowler, Commander, then lying in the Tagus,
and bound Home for England, who accordingly brought
him Home; tho', as it happen'd, Heaven brought the
Captain and the rest of the Crew so quickly to the End of
their Villainies, that they all came Home time enough to
be hang'd with their Lieutenant. But I return to Gow and
his Crew. Having thus dismiss'd the Brislol Man, and
clear'd his Hands of most of his Prisoners, he, with the
same wicked Generosity, gave the BrislolCaptain 13 Cer-
ons of Bees Wax, as a Gratuity forhisTroubleand Charge
with the Prisoners,and in Recompence, as he call'd it, for
the Goods he had taken from him, and so they parted.
What these several Captains did, to whom they thus
divided the Spoil of poor Ferneau's Cargo, or, as I ought
rather to call it, of the Merchants' Cargo which was load-
ed in Africa; I say, what was done with the Bees-wax and
other Things which they distributed to the Captains, and
their Crews, who they thus transpos'd from Ship to Ship,
that we cannot tell, nor indeed could these People either
well know how to keep it or how to part with it.
It was certainly a Gift they had no power to give, nor
had the other any Right to it by their Donation; but as the
Owners were unknown, and the several Persons possess-
ing it are not easily known, I do not see which way the
poor Dutchmen can come at their Goods again.
It istrue,indeed, the Ships which they exchang'd may,
and ought to be restored, and the honest Owners put in
possession of them again, and I suppose will be so in a le-
gal Manner; but the Goods were so dispers'd that it was
impossible.
Tmswas the last Prize they took, not only on the Coast
of Portugal, but any where else; for Gow who, to give him
his due, was a Fellow of Council, and had a great Presence
of Mind in Cases of Exigence, consider'd that as soon as
the Brislol Ship came into the River of Lisbon, they would
certainly give an Accountof them,as well of their Strength,
as of their Station in which they Cruized; and that conse-
quently the English Men of War, of which there are gene-
rally some in that River, would immediately come Abroad
to look for them: So he began to Reason with his Officers,
that now the Coast of Portugal would be no proper Place
at all for them, unless they resolved to fall into the Hand
of the said Men of War, and that they ought to consider
immediately what to do.
In these Debates, some advised one Thing, some an-
other, as is usual in like Cases: some were for going on to
the Coast of Guinea, where (as they said) was Purchase
enough, and very rich Ships to be taken; others were for
goingtothe Wesl Indies, and to Cruize amongthe Islands,
and take up their Station at Tobago ; others, and that not
those of the most Ignorant, proposed the standing in to
the Bay of Mexico, and to joyn in with some of a new sort of
Pirates at St Jago de la Cuba, who are all Spaniards, and
call themselves guar da del Co asl a, that is, Guardships for
the Coast; but under that pretence make Prize of Ships
of all Nations, and sometimes even of their own country-
men too, but especially of the English; but when this was
propos'd, it was answered they durst not trust the Spani-
ards.
Another sort was for going to the North of America,
and after having taken a Sloop or two on the Coast of
New-England or New-York, laden with Provisions for the
Wesl-Indies, which would not have been very hard to do,
such being often passing and re-passing there, and by
which they might have been sufficiently stor'd with Pro-
vision, then to have gone away to the South Seas; but Gow
objected, that they were not Mann'd sufficiently for such
an Undertaking ;andlikewise, that they had notsufficient
Stores of Ammunition, especially of Powder, and of
small Arms, for any considerable Action with the Spani-
ards.
Then it was offered by the Boatswain, who it seems,
had been in that Part of the World, to go away to theHon-
duras,znd to the Bay of Campeachy, amongthe Buccaneers
and Logwood Cutters, and there they should in the first
Place, be sure to pick up forty or fifty stout Fellows, good
Sailors, and bold, enterprising Men, who understand the
Spaniards and the Spanish Coast on both sides of America
as well as any Men in the World, and had all Fire Arms
with them, and Ammunition too; and that being well
Mann'd, they might take their hazard for Provisions,
which might be had any where, at least of one Sort if not
of another; besides, when they were thoroughly Mann'd,
they might cruize for Provisions any where, and might be
as likely to meet with the New-York and New-England
Sloops on the back of the Islands, in their way to Barba-
does and Jamaica, as any where.
Others said they should go first to the Islands of New-
Providence, or to the mouth of the Gulph of Florida, and
then cruising on the Coast of North America, and making
their Retreat at New Providence, Cruize from the Gulf of
Florida, North upon the Coast of Carolina, and as high as
the Capes of Virginia. But nothing could be resolv'd on;
till at last Gow let them into the Secret of a Project which,
as he told them, he had long had in his Thoughts, and
which was, to go away to the North of Scotland, near the
Coast of which, as he said, he was Born and Bred, and
where he said, if they met with no Purchase upon the Sea,
he could tell them how they should Enrich themselves by
going on Shore.
To bring them to concur with this Design, he repre-
sented the Danger they were in, where they were (as
above:) The want they were in of fresh Water, and of se-
veral kinds of Provisions, but, above all, the Necessity
they were in of careening and cleaning their Ship: That it
was too long a Run for them to go to the Southward; and
that they had not Provisions to serve them till they could
reach to any Place proper for that Purpose; and might be
driven to the utmost Distress if they should be put by
from Watering, either by Weather or Enemies.
Also he told them, if any of the Men of War came out
in Search of them, they would never Imagine they were
gone away to the Northward; so that their Run that Way
was perfectly secure: And he could assure them of his
own Knowledge, that if they landed in such Places as he
should direct, they could not fail of a comfortable Booty
in plundering some Gentlemens Houses, who liv'd Se-
cure and Unguarded very near the Shore: And that tho'
the Country should be Allarm'd, yet before the Govern-
ment could send any Men of War to Attack them, they
might clean their Ship, lay in a Store of fresh Provisions,
and be gone; and besides that they would get a good many
stout Fellows to go along with them, upon his Encourage-
ment; and that they should be better Mann'd than they
were yet, and should be Ready against all Events.
These Arguments, and their approaching Fate Con-
curring, had a sufficient Influenceon the Ship's Company
to prevail on them to Consent: So they made the best of
their Way to the Northward, and about the middle of last
January theyarrived at Carriftown, in the Isles of Orkney,
and came to an Anchor in a Place which Gow told them,
was safe Riding under the Lee of a small Island at some
Distance from the Port.
Gow being sole Director, as well as Commander of the
Ship, call'd them all together, to tell them what Account
they should give of themselves, when they came to Con-
verse with any of the People of the Island, thattheymight
agree in their Story, and give no Cause of Suspicion; and
'tis most certain, that had they been careful to observe his
Directions, and not betray'd and expos'd themselves,
they mighthavepass'dundiscover'd,anddoneall the Mis-
chief they intended without allarming the Country. His
Orders were, that they should say they came from Cadiz,
and were bound for Stockholm, and thence to Dantzick;
but that they had had a long Passage, by reason of con-
trary Winds, and lost their Opportunity of passing the
Sound, which was now full of Ice, if not frozen up; and
that they had been driven so far to the Norward by Stress
of Weather, that they wanted Water andfresh Provisions,
and to clean their Ship; that they would pay for whatever
they were supply'd with; and that by the Time they had
clean'd their Ship, they hop'd the Weather would be
Warm, and the Seas open for them to proceed on their
Voyage. This Tale was easie to tell, and probable enough,
and therefore likely enough to be believed; and they all
oblig'd themselves to give the same Account exactly, and
not to vary the least Tittle of it, or so much as whisper
otherwise, upon Pain of immediate Death.
I n Carristoun Harbour they found a small Scotch Bark
—Lumsdale, Master—-laden with Wineand Brandy, and
bound about to the Isle of Man; this wasawelcomeThing
to them all; and had it been any where else, they would
have made it a good Prize: But as they had Goods suffici-
ent on board, and such as were very Acceptable Merchan-
dise, Lumsdale traded freely with them, and Goto bartered
seven Cerons of Wax and about 2001. Weight of Barbary
Copper with him for a Hogshead of Geneva and an An-
chor of Brandy, and some other Goods; and itwas believed
that Gow had some Money into the Bargain.
A day or two after, a Swedish Vessel came into the
Road, bound from Stockholm to Glasgow, and laden with
Swedes Iron, and Easl Country Plank; they traded with
her also for 20 Coil of new Rope, for which Gow gave the
Master eleven Cerons of Bees Wax: It has been said, they
plunder'd this Vessel of several other Goods, and oblig'd
the Master to promise to Sail directly to his Port, without
speaking to any Body, on Pain of sinking the Ship; But
this wants Confirmation; nor is it Probable, they would
venture to do so in a Port where they resolv'd to stay any
long Time, and where they knew it was so Necessary to
be entirely conceal'd.
But now their Misfortunes began to come on, and
Things look'd but with an indifferent Aspect upon them;
for several of their Men, especially such of them as had
been forc'd or decoy'd into their Service, began to think
of making their Escape from them; and to cast about for
Means to bring it to pass. The first was a young Man,
who was originally one of the Ships Company, but was
Forced by fear of being Murther'd, as has been observ'd,
to give a silent Assent togo with them; he took an Oppor-
tunity to get away.
It was one Evening when the Boat went on Shore (for
they kept a civil Correspondence with the People of the
Town), this young Fellow being one of the Ships Crew,
vol. 11 o
andhaving been several Times on Shore before, and there-
fore not suspected, gave them the Slip, and got away to a
Farm-house which lay under a Hill, out of sight; and
there, for two or three Pieces of Eight, he got a Horse,
and soon, by that means escap'd to Kirkwall, a Market-
Town, and the Chief of the Orkneys, about 12 miles from
the Place where the Ship lay.
As soon as he came there, he surrender'dhimself to the
Government, desiring Protection, and inform'd them
who Gow was, and what the Ships Crew were, and upon
what Business they were Abroad; with what else he knew
of theirDesigns, as to plundering the Gentlemens Houses,
&c. Upon which they immediately rais'd the Country,
and got a strength together to defend themselves.
But the next Disaster that attended them, was, (for
Misfortunes seldom come alone) more fatal than this, for
1o of Gow's Men, most of them likewise Men forced into
the Service, went away with the long Boat, making the
best of their Way for the main Land of Scotland.
N.B. These Men however they did, and what Shift so-
ever they made to get so far, were taken in the Firtb of
Edenburg, and made Prisoners there.
Had Gow taken the Alarm, as he ought to have done,
at either of these Accidents, and put to Sea, either stood
over for the Coast of Norway, or have run thro' Weslward,
between the Islands, and gone for the Isle of Man, or for
the North of Ireland, he might easily have gone clear off;
for there was no Vessel in the Country that was of Force
sufficient to have spoken with him.
But harden'd for his own Destruction, and Justice
evidently pursuing him, he grew Bolder for the Disaster;
and notwithstanding that the Country was alarm'd, and
that he was fully discover'd, instead of making a timely
Escape, he resolved to Land upon them, and to put his
intended Projects, (viz.) of Plundering the Gentlemens
Houses, in Execution, whatever it cost him.
In Order to this, he sent the Boatswain and i0 Men
on Shore, the very same Night, very well Arm'd, direct-
ing them to go to the House of Mr Honnyman of Graham-
sey, Sheriff of the County, and who was himself at that
Time, to his great good Fortune, from Home: The Peo-
ple of the House had not the least Notice of their coming,
so that when they knock'd at the Door it was immediately
open'd, upon which they all enter'd the House at once,
except one Panton, who they set Centinel, and order'd
him to stand at the Door to secure their Retreat, and to
secure any from coming in after them.
Mrs Honnyman and her Daughter were extremely
Frighted at the sight of so many Armed Men coming in-
to the House, and ran screaming about, like People Dis-
tracted, while the Pirates, not regarding them, werelook-
ing about for Chests and Trunks, where they might ex-
pect to find some Plunder: And Mrs. Honnyman, in her
Fright, coming to the Door, ask'd Panton, the Man who
was set Centinel there, what theMeaningof it all was? and
he told her freely they were Pirates, and that they came to
Plunder the House. At this she recovered some Courage,
and run back into the House immediately; and knowing,
to be sure, where her Money lay, which was very Con-
siderable, and all in Gold, she put the Bags in her Lap,
and boldly rushing by Panton, who thought she was only
running from them, in a Fright, carryed it all off, and so
made her escape with the Treasure. The Boatswain being
inform'd that the Money was carryed off, resolved to re-
venge himselfby burningthe Writings andPapers, which
they call there, the Charters of their Estates, and are al-
ways of great Value in Gentlemens Houses of Estates; but
theyoung Lady, Mr Honnyman's Daughter, hearingth em
threaten to burn the Writings, watch'd her Opportunity,
and running to the Charter Room where they lay, and ty-
ing the most considerable of them up in a Napkin, threw
them out of the Window, jumpt after them herself, and
Escaped without Damage, though the Window was one
Story high at least.
However the Pirates had the Plundering of all the
rest of the House, and carryed off a great deal of Plate
and Things of Value; and forced one of the Servants,
who played very well on the Bagpipe, to march along,
Piping before them, when they carryed them off to the
Ship.
The next Day they weigh'd Anchor, intending, tho'
they had clean'd but one side of the Ship, to put out to Sea
and quit the Coast; but sailing Easlward, they came to an
Anchor again at a little Island, call'd Calf sound; and, hav-
ing some farther Mischief in their view here, the Boat-
swain went on Shore again, with some Armed Men; but
meeting with no other Plunder, they carryed off three
Women, who they kept on Board some time, and used so
Inhumanely that when they set them on Shore again, they
were not able to go or to stand: and we hear that one of
them dyed on the Beach where they left them.
The next Day they weigh'd again, holding the same
Course Easlward thro' theOpeningsbetweenthe Islands,
till they came off of Rossness: And now Gow resolved to
make the best of his Way for the Islandof £^,toPlunder
the House of Mr. Fea, a Gentleman of a considerable
Estate, and who Gow had some Acquaintance with, hav-
ing been at School together when they were youths.
It seems Gow's Reason for resolving to attack this
Gentleman, who was his old Acquaintance, was, that he
thoughtthe Alarm, given at Carrisloun, would necessarily
draw the Gentlemen, and the best of their Forces, that
Way, which Guess was far from being Improbable; for
just so it was, only with Respect to Mr. Fea, who having
had the Allarm with the rest, yet stay'd at Home on a par-
ticular Occasion, his Wife being, at that Time very much
Indisposed.
It is to be observ'd here, that CarriSloun and Eda lie
with Respect to each other, N.-Easl and S.-Wesl, and the
Bodies of the chief Islands lye between them.
On the 13th of February, in the Morning, Gowappear-
ing with his Ship off the Island, call'd the Calf sound, Mr.
Fea and his Family were very much alarm'd, not being
able to gather above six or seven Men for his Defence ., he
therefore wrote a Letter to Gow, intending to send it on
Board as soon as he should get into the Harbour, to desire
him to forbear the usual Salutes with his great Guns, be-
cause Mrs Fea his Wife was so very much Indispos'd:
And this, as he would oblige his old Schoolfellow, telling
him at the same time, that the Inhabitants were all fled to
the Mountains, on the Report of his being a Pirate,which
he hoped would not prove true; in which Case, he should
be very ready to supply him with all such Necessaries as
the Island would afford; desiring him to send the Mes-
senger safe back, at whose Return the Allarms of thePeo-
ple would immediately be at an End.
The Tide it seems runs extreamly Rapid among those
Islands, and the Navigation is thereby render'd very dan-
gerous and uncertain: Gow was an able Seaman, but he
was no Pilot for that Place, and which was worse, he had
no Boat to Assist, in case of Extremity, to ware the Ship;
and in turning into CalfSoundhe stoodalittletoonearthe
Point of a little Island call'd the Calf, and which lay in the
middle of the Passage; here his Ship, missing Stays, was
in great Danger of going a-Shore, to avoid which he
dropp'd an Anchor under his Foot, which, taking good
hold,broughthimup,andhethoughttheDangerwasover.
But as the Wind was, he lay so near the Shore, that he
could not get under Sail again for want of a Boat to Tow
him out of the Channel, or to carry off an Anchor to heave
him out.
That little Island above is uninhabited, but affords
Pasture to five or six Hundred Sheep, which Mr Fea al-
ways keeps upon it, for it belonged wholly to him: Gow
was now in Distress, and had no Remedy but to send his
small Boat on Shore to Mr Fea, to desire his Assistance,
that is to say, to desire him to lend him a Boat to carry out
an Anchor to heave off the Ship.
Mr Fea sent back the Boat, and one James Laing'm it,
with the Letter which I have already mentioned; Gow
sent him back immediately with this Answer, by Word of
Mouth, (viz.) that he would write to no Body; But if Mr
Fea would order his People to assist him with a Boat, to
carry out an Anchor, he would Reward them handsomly:
Mr Fea, in the mean time, order'd his great Boat (for he
had such a Boat as Gow wanted) to be stav'd and launch'd
into the Water and sunk, and the Masts, Sails, and Oars
to be carryed privately out of Sight.
While this was doing, Mr Fea perceiv'd Gow's Boat
coming on Shore, with five Persons in her: These Men
having landed on the main Island, left their Boat on the
Beach, and all together march'd directly up to the Mansion
House. This put him into some Surprise at first, how-
ever, he resolv'd to meet them in a peaceable Manner,
though he perceiv'd they were all double Arm'd: when
he came up to them he entreated them not to go up to the
House, becauseof thelanguishing Condition of his Wife;
that she was already frighted with the Rumours which
had been rais'd of their being Pirates, and that she would
certainly die with the fear she was in for herself and Fa-
mily, if they came to the Door.
The Boatswain answer'd, They did not desire to fright
his Wife, or any Body else; but they came to desire the
assistance of his Boat, and if he would not grant them so
small a Favour, he had nothing to expect from them but
the utmost Extremity. Mr Fea return'd that they knew
well enough he could not answer giving them, or lending
them his Boat, or any Help, as they appear'd to be such
People as was reported; but that if they would take them
by Force, he could not help himself.
But in the mean time, talking still in afriendly Manner
to them, he ask'd them to go to a neighbouring House,
which he said was a Change House, that is a Publick-
House, and take a Cup of Ale with him.
This they consented to, seeing Mr Fea was all alone, so
they went all with him; Mr Fea in the mean time found
means to give private Orders that the Oars, and Mast and
Sails of the Pirates boat should be all carry'd away, and
that in a quarter of an Hour after they had sat together, he
should be call'd hastily out of the Room on some pretence
or other of some body to speak with him, all which was
perform'd to a Tittle.
When he had got from them, he gave Orders that his
Six Men, who, as before, he had got together, and who
were now come to him well arm'd, should place them-
selves at a certain Stile, behind a thick Hedge, and which
was about half the way between the Ale-House and his
own House; that if he came that way with the Boatswain
alone, they should suddenly start out upon them both,
and throwing him down, should seize upon the other; but
that if all the five came with him, he would take an Occa-
sion to be either before or behind them, so that they might
all fire upon them without danger of hurting him.
Havi ng given these Orders, and depending upon their
being well executed, he return'd to the Company, and
having given them more Ale, told them he would gladly
do them any Service that he could lawfully do, and that if
they would take the trouble of walking up to his House
in a peaceable Manner, that his Family might not be
frighted with seeing himself among them, they should
have all the Assistance that was in his Power.
The Fellows, whether they had taken too much Ale, or
whether the Condition of their Ship, and the Hopes of
getting a Boat to help them, blinded their Eyes, is not cer^
tain, fell with ease into his Snare, and agreed readily to go
along with Mr Fea ; but after awhile resolv'd not to go all
of them, only deputed the Boatswain to go, which was
what Mr Fea most desir'd. The Boatswain was very will-
ing to accept of the Trust, but it was observ'd he took a
great deal of care of his Arms, which was no less than four
Pistols, all loaded with a brace of Bullets each; nor would
he be persuaded to leave any of them behind him, no, not
with his own Men.
I n thisPostur e Mr Fea and the Boatswain walk'd alon g
J
together very quietly till they came to the Stile, which
having got over, Mr Fea, seeing his Men all ready, turn'd
short about upon the Boatswain, and taking him by the
Collar, told him he was his Prisoner, and the same Mo-
ment the rest of his men rushing upon them, threw them
both down, and so secur'd the Boatswain without giving
him time so much as to fire one Pistol. He cry'd out, in-
deed, with all his Might to allarm his men, but they soon
stopt his Mouth, by first forcing a Pistol into it, and then
a Handkerchief, and having disarm'd him, and bound
his Hands behind him, and his Feet together, Mr Fea left
him there under a Guard, and with his five other Men,
but without any Arms, at least that could be seen, return'd
to the Ale-House to the rest: The House having two
Doors, they divided themselves, and having rush'd in at
both Doors at the same time, they seiz'd all the four men
before they were aware, or had time to lay hold of their
Arms: They did indeed what Men could do, and one of
them snapp'd a pistol at Mr Fea, but it did not go off; and
Mr Fea snatching at the Pistol at the same Moment to
divert the Shot if it had fir'd, struck his Hand with such
force against the Cock, as very much bruised his Hand.
They were all five now in his Power, and he sent them
away under a good Guard to a Village in the middle of the
Island, where they were kept separate from one another,
and sufficiently secur'd. Then Mr Fea despatch'd Ex-
presses to the Gentlemen in the neighbouring Islands to
acquaint them with what he had done, and to desire their
speedy Assistance; also desiring earnestly that they would
take care than no Boat should go within reach of the Pi-
rate's Guns; and at Night he, Mr Fea, caus'd Fires to be
made upon the Hills round him, to allarm the Country,
and ordered all the Boats round the Island to be haul'dup
upon the Beach as far as was possible, and disabled also,
lest the Pirates should swim from the Ship and get any of
them into their Possession.
Next Day, the i4th, it blew very hard all Day, and in
the Evening, about High Water, it shifted to W.N.W.,
upon which the Pirates set their Sails, expecting to get off,
and so to lay it round the Island, and put out to Sea; but
the Fellow who was order'd to cut the Cable missing seve-
ral strokes the Cable check'd the Ships Way, and conse-
quently, on a sudden, she took all a-back; then the Cable
being parted,when it should have held, the Ship ran direct-
ly on shore on the Calf Island; nor could all their Skill pre-
vent it. Then Gow, with an air of Desperation, told them
they were all dead Men: Nor indeed could it be otherways,
for having lost the only Boat they had, and five of their
best Hands, they were able to do little or nothing towards
getting their Ship off; besides, as she went on Shore, on
the Top of High Water, and a Spring Tide, there was no
Hope of getting her off afterward: Wherefore the next
morning, being Monday, the i5th, they hung out a white
Flag as a Signal for a Parley, and sent a Man on Shore,
upon Calf Island, for now they cou'd go on shore out of
the Ship almost at half Flood.
Now Mr Fea thought he might talk with Gow in a dif-
ferent Style from what he did before, so he wrote a Letter
to him, wherein he complain'd of the rude Behaviour of
his five Men, for which he told him he had been oblig'd
to seize on them and make them Prisoners, letting him
know that the Country, being all allarm'd, would soon be
too many for him; and therefore advis'd him to surrender
himself Peaceably, and be the Author of a quiet Surrender
of the reft, as the only Means to obtain any Favour; and
then he might become an Evidence against the rest, and
so might save his own Life.
This letter Mr Fea sent by a Boat with four armed
Men to the Island, to be given to the Fellow thatGow had
sent on Shore, and who waited there; and he at the same
time gave them a Letter from Gow to Mr. Fea; for now
he was humble enough to Write, which before he re-
fused.
Gow's letter to Mr Fea was to let him have some Men
and Boats to take out the best of the Cargoe, in order to
lighten the Ship and set her afloat; and offering himself to
come on Shore and be Hostage, for the Security of the
Men and Boats, and to give Mr Fea a thousand Pounds
in Goods for the Service: Declaring at the same time, if
this small Succour was refus'd him, he would take care no
Body should better himself by his Misfortune; for that
rather than to be taken, they would set Fire to the ship,
and would all Perish together.
Mr Fea reply'd to this Letter, That he had a Boat in-
deed, that would have been fit for his Service, but that she
was stav'd and sunk; but if he would come on Shore quiet-
ly without Arms, and bring his Carpenter with him to re-
pair the Boat, he might have her. This Mr Fea did to give
Gow an Opportunity to embrace his first offer of Surren-
dering. But Gow was neither Humble enough to come in,
nor Sincere enough to treat with him fairly, if he had in-
tended to let him have the Boat; and if he had, 'tis proba-
ble that the former Letter had made the Men Suspicious
of him; So that now he could do nothing without com-
municating it to the rest of the Crew.
About four in the Afternoon Mr Fea received an An-
swer to his last Letter: The Copy of which is exactly as
follows:—
"From on Board our Ship the
"Revenge, Feb. i6, i725.
"Honour'd SIR,
"I am sorry to hear of the irregular Proceedings of my
"Men. I gave no Orders to that Effect. And what hath
"been wrongfully done to the Country was contrary to
"my Inclination. It is my Misfortune to be in this Condi-
tion at present: It was in your Power to have done Other-
"wise in making my Fortune better. Since my being in
"the Country I have wrong'd no Man, nor taken any
"Thing but what I have paid for. My Design in coming
"was to make the Country the better, which I am still cap-
"able to do, providing you are just to me. I thank you for
"the Concern you have had for my bad Fortune; and am
"sorry I cannot embrace your Proposal, as being Evi-
dence; my People have already made use of that Ad-
vantage. I have by my last signified my Design of Pro-
ceeding, provided I can procure no better Terms.
"Please to send James Laing on board to continue till my
"return. I should be glad to have the good Fortune to
"commune with you upon that Subject. I beg you will as-
sist me with a Boat; and be assured I do no Man Harm,
"wer'tin my Power, as I am now at your Mercy. I cannot
"surrender myself Prisoner; I'd rather commit my self to
"the Mercy of the Seas: So that if you will incline to con-
"tribute to my Escape, shall leave you Ship and Cargo at
"your Disposal.
"I continue, honour'd Sir, &c,
John Smith."
Upon this Letter, and especially that Part wherein
Gow desires to commune with him, Mr Fea believing he
might do some Service in perswading him to submit, went
over to Calf Island, and went on Shore alone, ordering his
Boat to lie in readiness to take him in again, but not one
Man to stir out of her: And calling to Gow with a Speak-
ing-Trumpet, desir'd him to come on Shore, which the
other readily did: But Mr Fea, before he ventur'd, wisely
foresaw, that whilst he was alone, upon the Island, the
Pirates might unknown to him, get from the Ship by dif-
ferent Ways, and, under Cover of Shore, might get be-
hind and surround him; to prevent which, he set a Man
upon the top of his own House, which was on the opposite
Shore, and overlook'd the whole Island, and order'd him
to make Signals with his Flag, waving his flag once for
every Man that he saw come on Shore; but if four or more
came on Shore, then to keep the Flag waving continually,
till he, Mr Fea, should retire.
This Precaution was very needful, for no sooner was
MrFtfaadvanc'duponthe Island, expecting Gowtocome
on Shore, to meet him; but he saw a Fellow come from
the Ship with a white Flag, and a Bottle, and a Glass, and
a Bundle; then turning to his own House, he saw hisMan
make the Signals appointed, and that the Man kept the
flag continually waving; upon which he immediately re-
tir'd to his Boat, and he no sooner got into it, but he saw
five Fellows running under Shore, with lighted Matches
and Granadoes in their Hands, to have Intercepted him,
but seeing him'out of their Reach, they retir'd to the Ship.
After this the Fellow with the white Flag came up,
and gave Mr Fea two Letters; he would have left the
Bundle, which he said was a present to Mr Fea; and the
Bottle, which he said, was a Bottle of Brandy, but Mr
Fea would not take them; but told the Fellow his Captain
was a treacherous Villain, and he did not doubt but he
should see him hang'd; and as to him, the Fellow, he had
a great Mind to shoot him; upon which the Fellow took
to his Heels, and Mr Fea being in his Boat, did not think
it worth while to land again to pursue him. This put an
End to all Parlee for the present. But had the Pirates suc-
ceeded in this Attempt, they would have so far gained
their Point, either they must have been Assisted, or Mr
Fea must have been Sacrific'd.
The Two Letters from Gow were one for Mr Fea, and
the other for his Wife, the first was much to the same Pur •
pose as the former; only that in this, Gow requested the
great Boat with her Masts and Sails and Oars, with some
Provisions, to transport themselves whither they thought
fit to go for their own Safety; offering to leave the Ship and
Cargo to Mr Fea, and threatening, that if the Men of
War arrived (for Mr Fea had given him Notice that he
expected two Men of War) before he was thus assisted,
they would set Fire to the Ship and blow themselves up;
so that as they had liv'd they would all dye together.
The Letter to Mrs Fea, was to desire her to Intercede
with her Husband; and pleading that he was their Coun-
tryman, and had been her Husband's School-fellow, &c.
But no Answer was returned to either of these letters.
On the i7th, in the Morning, contrary to Expectation,
Gow himself came on Shore, upon the Calf-Island un-
arm'd, except his Sword, and alone, except one Man at
a distance, carrying a white Flag, making Signals for a
parlee.
Mr Fea, who by this time had gotten more People
about him, immediately sent one Mr Fea of Whitehall,
and a Gentleman of his own Family, with five other Per-
sons, well Armed, over to the Island, with Orders to se-
cure Gow, if it was possible, by any means, either Dead or
Alive. When they came on Shore, he proposed that one
of them, whose Name was Scollary, a Master of a Vessel,
should go on Board the Ship, as Hostage for this Gow's
Safety; and Scollary consenting, Gow himself conducted
him to the Ships side.
Mr Fea, perceiving this from his own House, immedi-
ately took another Boat, and went over to the Island him-
self: And while he was expostulating with his Men, for
letting Scollary go for Hostage, Gow return'd; and Mr
Fea made no Hesitation, but told him, in short, he was his
Prisoner; at which Gow starting, said, it ought not to be
so, since there was a Hostage delivered for him. Mr Fea
said he gave no Order for it, and it was what they could
not Justify; and since Scollary had ventured without Or-
ders, he must take his Fate; he would run the Venture of
it, but advis'd Gow, as he expected good Usage himself,
that he would send the Fellow who carryed his white Flag,
back to the Ship, with Orders for them to return Scollaryin
safety, and to desire PFinterznd Peterson to come withhim.
Gow declin'd giving any such Orders; but the Fellow
said he would readily go and fetch them, and did so, and
they came along with him. When Gow saw them, he re-
proach'd them for being so easily imposed, and order'd
them to go back to the Ship immediately. But Mr Fea\
Men, who were too strong for them, surrounded them,
and took them all. When this was done, they demanded
Gow to deliver his Sword, but he said he would rather dye
with it in his Hand, and begg'd them to shoot him: But
that was deny'd; and Mr Fea's Men, disarming him of
his Sword, carriedhim with the other two, into their Boat,
and after that to the main Island, where Mr Fea liv'd.
Having thus secur'd the captain, Mr Fea prevailed
with him to go to the Shore over-against the Ship, and to
call the Gunner and another Man to come on Ashore on
Calf-Island, which they did; but they was no sooner there,
but they also were surrounded by some Men, which Mr
Fea had placed out of sight upon the Island for that Pur-
pose; Then they made Gow to call to the Carpenter to
come on Shore, still making them believe they should
have a Boat, and Mr Fea went over and met him alone,
and talking to him, told him they could not repair the
Boat without Help, and without Tools, so perswadedhim
to go back to the Ship, and bring a Hand or two with him,
and some Tools, some Ockham, Nails, &c. The Carpen-
ter, being thus deluded, went back, and brought a French-
man and another with him, with all Things proper for
their Work; all which, as soon as they came on Shore,
were likewise seiz'd and secured by Mr Fea and his Men.
But there was still a great many Men in the Ship, who
it was necessary to bring, if possible, to a quiet Surrender.
So Mr Fea order'd his Men to make a Feint as if they
would go to Work upon the great Boat which lay on Shore
upon the Island, but in sight of the Ship; there they ham-
mer'd, and knock'd, and made a Noise, as if they were
really caulking and repairing her, in order to her being
launch'd off and put into their Possession. But towards
Night he oblig'd Gow to write to the Men that Mr Fea
would not deliver the Boat till he was in Possession of the
Ship; and therefore he order'd them all to come on Shore,
without Arms, and in a peaceable manner.
This occasioned many Debates in the Ship; but as
they had no Officers to guide them, and were all in Con-
fusion, they knew not what to do: So after some time, be-
wailing their hard Fate, and dividing what Money was
left in the Ship among them, they yielded, and went on
Shore, and were all made Prisoners, to the number of
eight-and-twenty, including those who were secur'd be-
fore.
How he brought Gow to be so weak was something
strange; Gow being not very supple and far from being
sufficiently humble: But whether it was that he hoped to
fare the better for it, and to plead some Merit by obliging
his Men to come in without Blood and perhaps they might
encourage him in such Expectations, tho' not promise
him, for the last they could not.
Or whether it was that Gow, who knew their Circum-
stances and Temper also, was satisfy'd if he did not per-
swade them to it, they would certainly do it without any
Persuasion in a Day or two more, having, indeed, no
other Remedy, and some of them beingreally forced Men,
desiring nothing more than to surrender.
And if it was neither of these, perhaps Gow, whose
Case was now desperate, and who was fully in the Power
of his Enemies, and in the Hands of Justice himself, from
whom he had indeed no reason to expect any Favour, was,
perhaps I say, he was not over-desirous to have the rest
make their Escape, and therefore was easier to perswade
them to put themselves into the same unhappy Circum-
stances with himself; it being most Natural to People in
such Circumstances to desire to have their Comrades en-
gulfed in the same Misery.
Be it which of these it will, Mr Fea did certainly prevail
vol. ii p
with Gow to be the Instrument to write to them, and to
joyn, as it were, with Mr Fea's Stratagem to draw them
on Shore, without which they had not come, at least not
at that Time, and so they said afterwards, upbraiding
him with having betray'd them; and yet it seems plain
too, that when they went they took it for granted that
they should be made Prisoners, by their Exclamations
one to another, and by their sharing the Money among
them, as is said above.
It was indeed a most agreeable Sight, to see such a
Crew of desperate Fellows so tamely surrender to a few
almost naked Countrymen, and to see them so Circum-
vented by one Gentleman that they were rendered quite
Useless to themselves, and to their own Deliverance; the
want of a Boat was as much to them as an actual Imprison-
ment; nay, they were indeed in Prison in their Ship, nor
was they able to stir one way or other, Hand or Foot; it
was too Cold to swim over to the Island and seize the
Boat,and if they had, unless they had done it immediately
at first, the People on Shore would have been too strong
for them; so that they were as secure on board the Ship, as
to any Escape they could have made, as they were after-
wards in the Condemn'd Hold in Newgate.
Again, never were People more foolishly Circumvent-
ed when they had a Boat and Conveniences, for had they
gone on Shore then, while they had a Boat, tho' it was but
their small Boat, yet going at twice, twenty or five and
twenty Men of them, they mighthaverepair'dandlaunch-
ed Mr Fea's great Boat, in spite of all he could have done
to hinder it, and then, if they could not have got their Ship
off, they might have come away, as the Fellows did, with
their own Boat, and might soon have found Means to get
a bigger Boat on the Coast, either of Scotland or England,
and getting on Shore in the Night, in any convenient Part
of England, might have dispers'd and mixt themselves
among the People, and made an effectual Escape.
But their End was apparently at hand; Justice was
ready for them; their Crimes had ripen'd them for the
Gallows, and the Gallows claim'd them; their Time was
come, and it was not in their Power to avoid it.
I am longer upon this particular Part because it is so
very remarkable, and the Circumstances of it are so un-
accountable; That the Boatswain should come on Shore
with his Boat, and no more but four Men, thinking to fire
and plunder Mr Fea's House with that little Crew; as if
he could imagine Mr Fea, who they knew was alarm'd
and had been acquainted with what they were, should
have no Body at all with him, or that he could storm his
House with that little Force.
Then that he should be wheedled into an Ale House
by a single Gentleman; as if he would have ventur'd him-
self into an Ale House with them if he had not had help at
Hand to rescue him if any thing had been offered to him.
Then, which was still worse, that they should be taken
with the old Bite of having the Gentleman call'd out of
the Room, when they were together, as if he could have
any Business to talk of there but to lay a Trap for them,
and which, if they had their Eyes about them, or, as we
might say, any Eyes in their Heads, they might have seen
into easily enough.
And to conclude this scene of Madness and Folly to-
gether, they came all away and left their Boat, with no
Body either in her to keep her a-float, or near her to guard
and defendher: Nothing butMeninfatuatedtotheirown
Destruction, and condemn'd by the visible Handof Hea-
ven to an immediate Surprize, could have been so stupid;
they might have been sure, if there were any People in the
Island, they would if possible secure their Boat; and they
ought at least to have considered the forlorn Condition of
the rest of their Company in the Ship, without a Boat to
help themselves: But blinded by their inevitable Fate, in
a Word, they run into the Snare with their Eyes open;
they stood as itwere,lookingon,andsawthemselvestaken
before it was done.
Nay, some of the Men were heard to say, that if their
Captain, Gow himself, had but said the Word, they were
able to have built a Boat on Board, with such stuff as they
could have pull'd from the Sides and Ceilings of theShipt
at least big enough to have gone out to Sea, and sailing
along the Coast, have either found a better, or seiz'dupon
some other Vessel in the Night, or to have made their
Escape.
But never Creatures were taken so tamely, trick'd so
easily, and so entirely disabled from the least Defence, or
the least Contrivance for their Escape; even GoTOhimself,
who, as I said before, never wanted a resolute Courage or
Presence of Mind before, and was never daunted by any
Difficulties, yet was now snapp'd under a pretence of a
Hostage, delivered, and being himself taken and dis-
arm'd, yields himself to be made a Tool of to bring all the
rest to yield at Discretion.
I n a word, they were as void of Counsel as of Courage;
they were outwitted on every Occasion; they could not
see in the open Day what any one else would have felt in
the Dark; but they dropp'd insensibly into Mr Fea's
Hand by one, and two, and three at a time, as if they had
told him before hand, that if he went on with his Strata-
gem, he should be sure to have them all in his Custody
very quickly: And tho' every one, as fast as they went on
Shore, were made Prisoners, and secur'd, yet the other
were made to believe they were at Liberty, and were sim-
ple enough to come on Shore to them.
Every thing we can say of the blindness and folly of
these People, who Heaven having determin'd to Punish-
ment, demented and blinded to preparethemfortheir be-
ing brought to it, I say, everything that can be said to ex-
pose their Stupidity and blindness, is a just Panegyrick
upon the Conduct of that Gentleman, by whose happy
Conduct, and the dexterous Turn he gave to every Inci-
dent which happen'd in the whole Affair, was indeed the
principal Means of their being all apprehended.
Had this Gentleman, knowing their Strength and
Number was so great, being four times as many Men as
he had about him, and better provided for Mischief, than
he was for Defence; had he, as it seems others did, fled
with his Family over the Firth, or Arm of the Sea, which
parted his Island from the rest, by which they had secur'd
themselves from Danger; or had he, with the few Men
and Fire Arms which he had about him, fortified and de-
fended themselves in his House, and resolv'd to defend
themselves there, the Pirates had in all probability gone
off again, left him, and made their Escape: Nay, if they
had run their Ship a-ground, as they afterwards did, and
tho' they had been obliged to lay the Bones there, they
would, however, have got away some Boat off the Shore
to have made a Long-boat of, and havemade their Escape
along the Coast, till they came to Newcaslle upon Tyne,
and there nothing had been more easy than to have sepa-
rated and gone to London, some in one ship, some in an-
other ; or, as one of thempropos'd, they should have found
some Coasting Bark or other riding near the Shore, which
they might have boarded, and so gone off to Sea which
way they pleas'd.
But they were come a great Way to bring themselves
to Justice, and here they met with it in the most remark-
able Manner, and with such Circumstances as I believe
are not to be imitated in the World.
When they were all on Shore, and were told that they
were Prisoners, they began to re assume a kind of Cou-
rage, and to look upon one another, as if to lay hold of
some Weapons to resist; and 'tis not doubted but if they
had had Arms then in their Hands, they would have made
a desperate Defence. But it was too late, the thing was all
over, they saw their Captain and all their Officers in the
same Condition, and there was no room for Resistance
then; all they could have done had been only to cause
them to be the more effectually secur'd, and perhaps to
have had some or other of them knock'd on the Head for
Example; so seeing there was no Remedy they all sub-
mitted quietly, and were soon dispers'donefromanother,
till more Strength came to carry them off, which was not
long.
Thus ended their desperate Undertaking, Heaven
having by a visible Infatuation upon themselves, and a
Concurrence of other Circumstances, brought them all
into the Hands of Justice, and that by the particular Bra-
very and Conduct of one Gentleman, I mean Mr Fea,
who so well manag'd them, that, as above, having at first
but five or six Men with him, he brought the whole Com-
pany, partly by Force and partly by Stratagem, to sub-
mit, and that without any loss of Blood on one side or
other.
Among the rest of the Papers found on board the Ship,
was the following Copy of a Draft, or Agreement of Arti-
cles or Orders, or what you please to call them, which
were to have been sign'd, and were for the Direction of
the Men, whether on Shore or on Board, when they came
to an Anchor in the Orkneys.
They would, I suppose, have been put up upon the
Mainmast if they had had longer time; but they soon
found Articles were of no Value with such Fellows; for
the going away with the Long-boat, and ten Men in her,
confounded all their Measures, made them jealous and
afraid of one another, and made them act afterwards as if
they were under a General Infatuation or Possession, all-
ways Irresolute and Unsettled, void of any Forecast or
reasonable Actings; but having the Plunder of MrFea's
House in their View, when they should have chiefly re-
garded their own Safety and making their Escape; they
push'd at the least Significant, tho' most difficult Part,
and which was their Ruin in the Undertaking, when they
should at first have secured their Lives, which, at least to
them, was the Thing of most Value, tho' the easiest at
that Time to have secur'd.
By this preposterous Way of Proceeding they drew
themselves into the Labyrinth and weredestroy'd, without
any possibility of Recovery; nay, they must have perish'd
by Hunger and Distress, if there had been no Body to
have taken them Prisoners; for having no Boat to supply
them with Necessaries, their Ship fast a-ground upon a
barren and uninhabited Island, andnowaytobesupply'd,
they were themselves in the utmost Despair, and I think
it was one of the kindest Things that could be done for
them, to bring them off, and hang them out of the way.
Their foolish Articles were as follows, (viz.)
I. That every Man shall obey his Commander in all
Respects, as if the Ship was his own, and weunder Month-
ly Pay.
II. That no Man shall give or dispose of the Ship's
Provisions, whereby may be given Reason of Suspicion
that every one hath not an equal Share.
III. That no Man shall open or declare to any Person
or Persons what we are, or what Design we are upon; the
Offender shall be punish'd with Death upon the spot.
IV. That no Man shall go on Shore till the Ship is off
the Ground and in readiness to put to Sea.
V. That every Man shall keep his Watch Night and
Day, and precisely at the Hour of Eight leave off Gaming
and Drinking, every one repair to their respective Sta-
tions.
VI. Whoever Offends shall be punish'd with Death,
or otherwise, as we shall find proper for our Interest.
N.B. This Draft of Articles seems to be imperfect, and
as it were only begun to be made, for that there were seve-
ral others intended to be added, but it was suppos'd that
their Affairs growing desperate, their Long-Boat gone,
and the Boatswain and Boat's Crew, in the Pinnace or
smaller Boat gone also, and made Prisoners, there was no
more need of Articles, nor would any-Body be bound by
them if they were made; so the farther making of Orders
and Articles was let alone.
These that were made were written with Gow's own
Hand, and 'tis suppos'd that the rest would have been
done so too, and then he would have taken care to have
them executed; but he soon found there was no Occasion
of them, and I make no Question but all their other Pa-
pers and Articles of any kind were destroy'd.
Being now all secur'd and in Custody in the most pro-
per Places in the Island, Mr Fea took care to give Notice
to the proper Officers in the Country, and by them to the
Government at Edenburgh, in order to get help for the
carrying them to England. The Distance being so great,
this took up some Time, for the Government at Eden-
burgb being not immediately concern'd in it, but rather
the Court of Admiralty of Great Britain, Expresses were
dispatch'd from thence to London, that his Majesty's
Pleasure might be known; in return to which, Orders
were dispatch'd into Scotland to have them immediately
sent up to England, with as much Expedition as the Case
would admit; and accordingly they were brought up by
Land to Edenburgh first, and from thence being put on
Board the Greyhound Frigate, they were brought by Sea
to England.
This necessarily took up a great deal of Time, so that
had they been wise enough to improve the Hours that
were left, they had almost half a year's time to prepare
themselves for Death; tho' they cruelly deny'd the poor
Mate a few Moments to commend his Soul to God's
Mercy, even after he was half Murther'd before: I say,
they had almost half a year, for they were most of them in
Custody the latter end of January, and they were not
Executed till the i ith of June.
The Greyhound arriv'd in the River the 2 6th, of March,
and the next day came to an Anchor at Woolwich, and the
Pyrates being put into Boats appointed to receive them,
with a strong Guard to attend them, were brought on
shore the 30th, convey'd to the Marshalsea Prison in
Southwark, where they were deliver'd to the Keeper of
the said Prison, and were laid in Irons, and there they had
the Mortification to meet their Lieutenant Williams, who
was brought home by the Argyle Man of War from Lis-
bon, and had been committed to the same Prison for a
very few days.
Indeed, as it was a Mortification to them, so it was
more to him; for tho' he might be secretly pleas'd that
those who had so Cruelly, as he caWd it, put him into the
Hands of Justice by the sending him to Lisbon, were
brought into the same Circumstances with himself, yet,
on the other hand, it could not but be a terrible Mortifica-
tion to him that here now were sufficient Witnesses found
to prove his Crimes upon him, which were not so easie to
be had before.
Being thus laid fast, it remain'd to proceed against
them in due form, and this took up some longer time still.
On Friday, the 2nd of April, they were all carried to
Dolors-Commons, where, the proper Judges being pre-
sent, they were examin'd, by which Examination due
Measures were taken for the farther Proceedings; for as
they were not equally Guilty, so it was needful to deter-
mine who it was proper to bring to an immediate Tryal,
and who being less Guilty, were more proper Objects of
the Governments Clemency, as being under force and
fear, and consequently necessitated to Act as they did;
and also who it might be proper to single out as Evidence
against the rest; after being thus Examin'd, they were re-
manded to the Marshalsea.
On Saturday, the 8 th of May, the five who were ap-
pointed for Evidence against the rest, and whose Names
are particularly set down in its Place, were sent from the
Marshalsea Prison in Newgate, in order to give their In-
formations.
Be1ng thus brought up to London, and committed to
the Marshalsea Prison, and the Government being fully
inform'd what black uncommon Offenders they were, it
was thought proper to bring them to speedy Justice.
In order to this, some of them, as is said, who were less
Criminal than the rest, and who apparently had been
forc'd into their Service, were formed out, and being ex-
amin'd, and giving first an Account of themselves and
then of the whole Fraternity, it was thought fit to make
use of their Evidence for the more clear detecting and
convincing of the rest. These were George Dobson, John
Phinnes, Timothy Murphy, William Booth.
These were the principal evidence, and were indeed
more than sufficient; for they so exactly agreed in their
evidence, and the prisoners (pirates) said so little in their
defence, that there was no room for the jury to question
their guilt, or to doubt the truth of any part of the account
given in.
Robert Read was a young man (mentioned above)
who escap'd from the Boat in the Orkneys, and getting a
Horse at a Farmer's House, was convey'd to Kirkwall,
the chief Town of the said Orkneys, where he surrendered
himself: Nevertheless he was brought up with the rest as
a Prisoner, nor was he made use of as Evidence, but was
try'd upon most, if not all, the Indictments with the rest.
But Dobson, one of the Witnesses, did him the Justice to
testifie that he was forc'd into their Service, as others
were, for fear of having their Throats cut, as others had
been serv'd before their Faces; and that, in particular, he
was not present at, or concern'd in, any of the Murthers
for which the rest were Indicted; upon which Evidence
he was Acquitted by the Jury.
Also he brought one Archibald Sutor, the Man of the
House, said above to be a Farm-House, whither the said
Read made his Escape in the Orkneys, who testified that
he did so Escape to him, and that he begg'd him to pro-
cure him a Horse to ride off to Kirkwall, which he did,
and that there he surrender'd himself. Also he testified
that Read gave him (Sutor) a full Account of the Ship, and
of the Pirates that were in her, and what they were; and
he {Sutor) discover'd it all to the Collector of the Customs;
by which means the Country was alarm'd: And he added,
that it was by this Man's means that all the Prisoners were
apprehended; (tho' that was a little too much too) for 'tis
plain it was by the Vigilance and Courage of Mr Fea
chiefly: They were reduc'd to such Distress as oblig'd
them to surrender.
However, it was true that Read's Escape did allarm
the Country, and that he merited very well of the Publick
for the timely Discovery he made: So he came off clear,
as indeed it was but Just; for he was not only forc'd to
serve them (as above) but as Dobson testified for him, he
had often express'd his Uneasiness, as being oblig'd to
act with them, and that he wish'd he cou'd get away; and
that he was Sincere in those Wishes, as appear'd in that
he took the first Opportunity he could get to put it in
Practice.
N.B. This Dobson was one of the ten Men who ran
away with the Pirates' Long-Boat from the Orkneys, and
who were afterwards made Prisoners in the Firth of Leigh
and carried to Edinburgh.
Gow was now a Prisoner among the reft in the Mar-
shalsea; his Behaviour there was Sullen and Reserv'd ra-
ther than Penitent: It had been hinted to him by Mr Fea,
as others, that he should endeavour, by his Behaviour, to
make himself as Evidence against others, and to merit his
Life by a ready Submission, and obliging others to do the
like. But Gow was no Fool, and he easily saw there were
too many gone before who had provided for their own
Safety at his Expence. And besides that, he knew himself
too deeply guilty of Cruelty and Murther to be excepted
by the public Justice as an Evidence, especially where so
many other less Criminals weretobehad. This, I say, made
him, and with good Reason too, give over any Thoughts
of Escaping by such means as that: And perhaps seeing
so plainly that there was no Room for it, might be the
Reason why he seemed to reject the Offer; otherwise he
was not a Person, of such nice Honour as that we should
suppose he would not have secur'd his own Life at the
Expence of his Comrades.
But, as I say, Gow was no Fool. So he seem'd to give
over all Thought of Life, from the first time he came to
England; not that he shew'd any Tokens of his Repent-
ance, or any Sense of his Condition, suitable to what was
before him; But continuing (as above) Sullen and re-
serv'd, even to the very time he was brought to the Bar:
When he came there, he could not be try'd with the rest;
for the Arraignment being made in the usual Form, he re-
fused to Plead. The Court usedall the Arguments which
HumanityDicl;atesinsuch Cases, toprevailonhimtocome
into the ordinary Course of other People in like Govern-
ment, laying before him the Sentence of the Law in such
Cases, namely, that he must be press'd to Death, the only
torturing Execution which remains in our Law, which,
however, they were oblig'd to Inflict.
But he continued Inflexible, and carryed on his Ob-
stinacy to such a height, as to receive the Sentence in
Form, as usual in such Cases, the Execution being ap-
pointed to be done the next Morning, and he was carryed
back to Newgate in order to it: But whether he was pre-
vailed with by Argument, and the Reasons of those about
him, or whether the Apparatus for the Execution and the
manner of the Death he was to dye terrified him, we can-
not say; but the next Morning he yielded, and petitioned
to be allow'd to Plead, and be admitted to be try'd in the
ordinary Way; which being granted, he was brought to
the Bar by himself, and pleaded, being arraign'd again
upon the same Indictment, upon which he had been sen-
enc'd as a Mute, and was found Guilty.
Williams, the Lieutenant,who, as has been said, was
put on Board a Brislol Ship, with Orders to deliver him on
Board the first English Man of War they should meet
with; comes, of course, to have the rest of his History
made up in this Place.
The Captain of the Brislol Ship, tho' he receiv'd his
Orders from the Crew of Pirates and Rogues, whose In-
structions he was not oblig'd to follow, and whose Accu-
sation of Williams, they were not oblig'd to give credit to,
yet punctually obey'd the Order and put him on Board
the Argyle. Captain Bowler, then lying in the Port of Lis-
bon, and bound for England, who, as they took him in
Irons, kept him so, and brought him to England in the
same Condition.
But as the Pirates did not send any of their Company,
nor indeed could they do it, along with him, to be Evi-
dence against him; and the Men who went out of the Pi-
rate Ship on Board a Brislol Ship being till then kept as
Prisoners on Board the Pirate Ship, and perhaps could
not have said enough, or given particular Evidence suffi-
cient to convict him ina Court of Justice, Providence sup-
ply'd the Want, by bringing the whole Crew to the same
Place (for Williams was in the Marshalsea Prison before
them), and by that means furnishing sufficient Evidence
against Williams also, so that they were all try'd together.
In Williams'?, Case the Evidence was as particular as
in Gow's; and Dobson and the others swore positively,
that Williams boasted that after Macaulay had cut the
Super Cargo's throat imperfectly, he {Williams) did his
Business, that is to say, murthered him; and added, that
he would not give him Time to say his Prayers, but shot
him thro' the Head: Phinnes and Timothy Murphy testify-
ing the same. And to show the bloody Disposition of this
Wretch, William Booth testified that Williams propos'd
afterwards to the Company, that if they took any more
Ships, they should not incumber themselves with the
Men, having already so many Prisoners, that in Case of a
Fight they should take them and tye them back to back,
and throw them all over board into the Sea.
It should not be omitted here also in the Case of Gow
himself, that as I have observ'd in the Introduction, that
Gow had long meditated the kind of Villainy which he
now put in Practice, and that it was his Resolution to turn
Pyrate the first Opportunity he should get, whatever Voy-
age he undertook, and that I observ'd he had intended it
on Board a Ship in which he came home from Lisbon, but
fail'd only for want of making a sufficient Party; so this
Resolution of his, is Confirm'd by the Testimony and
Confession of James Belvin, one of his fellow Criminals,
who upon the Tryal declar'd that he knew that Gow (and
he added the Crew of the George Galley) had a Design to
turn Pyrates from the beginning, and added, that he dis-
cover'd it to George Dobson in Amslerdam, before the Ship
went out to sea; for the Confirmation of this, Dobson was
call'd up again, after he had given his Evidence upon the
Tryals, and being confronted with Belvin, he did acknow-
ledge that Belvin had said so, and that in particular he had
said, the Boatswain and several Others had such a De-
sign to murther the Master and some Others, and run
away with the Ship; and being ask'd what was the Rea-
son why he did not immediately discover it to the Master
Captain Ferneau; he answer'd, that he heard him (Belvin)
tell the Mate of it, and that the Mate told the Captain of"
it; but that the Captain made light of it; but that tho' he
was persuaded not to let the Boatswain go along with
them, yet the Captain said, he fear'd them not, and would
still take him; but that the Boatswain finding himselfDis^
cover'd, refus'd to go; upon which Gow was named for
Boatswain, but was made second Mate, and then Belvin
was made Boatswain; and had he been as Honest after-
ward as before whereas, on the contrary, he was as for-
ward and active as any of them, except that he was not in
the first seeret, nor in the Murthers, he migh t have escap'd
what afterwards became so justly his Due; But as they
Acted together, Justice requir'd they should Suffer, and
accordingly Gow and Williams, Belvin, Melvin, Winter,
Peterson, Rollson, Mackawley, receiv'd the Reward of their
Cruelty and Blood at the Gallows, being all Executed to-
gether the i ith of June.
N.B.—Gow, as if Providence had directed that he
should be twice Hang'd, his Crimes being of a Two-fold
nature, and both Capital; soon he was turn'd off, fell down
from the Gibbet, the Rope breaking by the Weight of
some that pull'd his Legs to put him out of Pain. He was
still alive and sensible, tho' he had Hung four Minutes,
and able to go up the Ladder the second Time, which he
did with very little Concern, and was Hang'd again;
and since that a third Time (viz.) in Chains over-against
Greenwich, as Williams is over against Blackwall.
FINIS
VOl. II
q
of the Life and Actions of the late
JONATHAN WILD
Not made up of Fiflion and Fable,
but taken from his Own Mouth
and colle&ed from papers
of his Own Writing.
THE several absurd andridiculous Accounts which have
been Publish''d, notwithslanding early and seasonable
Caution given, of the Life and Conduit of this famous, or
if you please infamous Creature, Jonathan Wild, make a
short Preface to this Account absolutely necessary.
ITissomethingslrange, that a Man's Life should be made
a kind of a Romance before his Face, and while he was upon
the Spot to contradicl it; or, that the World should be so fond
of a formal Chimney-corner Tale, that they had rather a
Story should be made merry than true.
THE Author of this short but exacl Account of Mr. Wild
assures the World, that the greatesl Part of all that has hith-
erto appeared of this Kind, has been evidently invented and
jramed out of the Heads of the scribbling Authors, meerly to
get a Penny, without regard to Truth or Facl, or even to Pro-
bability, or without making any Conscience of their imposing
on the Credulous World.
NAT, so little Ground has there been for them, that except
there was such a Man as Jonathan Wild, that he was born at
Wolverhampton, liv'd in the Old-Bayley, was call'd a
Thief-Catcher, and was Hang'd at Tyburn, there is not one
Story printed of him that can be calFd Truth, or that is not
mingled up with so much Falshood and Fable as to smother
and drown that little Truth which is at the bottom of it.
THE following Tract does not indeed make a Jesl of his
Story as they do, or present his Hislory, which indeed is a
Tragedy of itself, in a slile of Mockery and ridicule, but in a
Method agreeable to the Facl. They that had rather have a
Falshood to laugh at, than a true Account of Things to inform
them, had besl buy the Ficlion, and leave the Hislory to those
who know how to dislinguish Goodfrom Evil.
THE Undertaker\f\ of this Work havingeasilyforeseen
that the Story of this eminent Criminal would be accept-
ible to the World',resolvedsometime ago topublish it,but
knowing at the same time it would be attempted over and
over by our Hackney Grub-street Writers, upon the old Pick-
pocket Principle of Publishing any Thing to get a Penny; they
therefore took care not only to furnish themselves with authen-
tick, andfullvouchersfor the Truth of what they have to say,
but also to have the Account of him be very particular, and
such as may answer their Title.
UPON the Assurance of their being thus provided,not only
to give a true, but also a full and compleat Account of him,
they took care to give the World an early and timely Notice
that such a Work was preparingfor the Press, in order to pre-
vent People's being impos'd upon; and to that purpose they
advertis'd this Work in several Publick Prints; and they are
satisfy'd that as on one Hand, it has prepared the World to ex-
pecl this Account, so it willfully answer their expeclation now
it appears.
THEY have not satisfy'd themselves in their Enquiries, to
take Things upon the Credit oj' Common Fame, which (gener-
ally speaking) is a Common Something; nor have they sup-
plyed, by Invention, the Particulars of what wanted such
Helps. The Life of this unhappy Wretch is too full of Inci-
dents, and that of an uncommon Nature, to stand in Need of
any such Helps; and we are so far from wanting Matter to
fill up this Tracl, and make the Story out, that on the contrary,
we are forc'd to abridge and contracl some of the mosl con-
siderable Passages of his Life, that we may bring it all into as
narrow a Compass as we can.
THE Life of Jonathan Wild is aperfeclly new Scene: as
bis Conduit has been Inimitable} so his Imployment has been
singular to him, and is like to be so, for as it began, so it is like
to dye with him; no Man among the mosl daring of the Clan
being, we believe, so hardy as to venture to take it up after
him.
EVER Y Step he took was Criminal, and the very Aclions
which he did with the greatesl openness and an avowed Pro-
fess'd Allowance, merited the Gallows even by the very Let-
ter; but pray Note, when we say Allowance, we mean his
own Allowance, for no other Power or Person could allow
him in it.
IT is true, he had an inimitable Boldness in his Behaviour
and by detecling some Criminals, he assumed a kind of Power
toprotecl others, only the difference lay here, namely, that he
did the firsl Publickly, and the lasl Privately; so that in a
Word, he served the Publick in thefir si, and abused the Pub-
lick in the second, and was only deceived in this, that be
thought his being Useful in the fir si, would protecl him in be-
ing Criminal in the lasl; but here he was, we say Mislaken,
and fell into a Snare which all his pretended Merit could not
deliver him from.
TA KE him as a Man, only he had a kind of brutal Courage
which fitted him to be an Inslrument in attacking some of the
mosl desperate of the several Gangs of Rogues he had to do
with. But as this Courage also serv'd to make him Audacious
in the other wicked Things he undertook, he was rather Bold
than couragious, and might be calFdImpudent, but we cannot
say he was Brave, as appeared in a more particular manner
in his slupid and confus'd Behaviour, during his lying in
Newgate, and at his Execution, of which in its Place.
WE have the Advantage in this Account to come at the
4
particular of his Story from unqueslioned Authority, for as he
was sensible wrong Accounts would be publish'd of him, he
was not backward to give Materials from his own Mouth
which no Body can contradicl; and others fully conversant
with him, having given the same Stories or Accounts of the
same Fads, we have the Satisfaclion to see them agree fully
together, and thereby be assured of the Truth of both; for in
such Cases there could be no Combination to deceive us.
NOT that it is possible to obtain a full Account of all the
particular Villainies of Jonathan Wild, during a series of
sixteen Years, in which he reign'd in all his Wickedness with
such Success, as no Age canproduce the like. 'Tis enough if we
give you a general View of his Life, or a Scheme of his Prac-
tice, illuslrated by Examples; which Examples likewise might
befarther set forth by more Examples and by Stories full of an
infinite variety, which if coHeeled together, would make up a
large Volume in Folio, and yet leave many of them unrelated.
IT is true, as we shall take Notice in its Place, that the
World does not charge Jonathan with being himself aclually
a Highwayman or Robber; or that when any of the Gangs of
Prancers (as they are call'd in the Newgate Cant) went out
upon the Grand Design, he ever went with them, and we are
assur'd he did not: He knew the Trade too well, to put his
Life into such a Hazard; he knew how common a Bite it was
among such People to save their own Lives at the Expense of
their companions; but he was too Cunning for that. And he
had likewise a so much better Trade in Hand, by which he
was sure to make a Prey both of the Persons Robb'd, and of
the Rogues that robb'd them; that he would have been worse
than Lunatick, if he had been drawn in to be a Party.
THE Part he acled in the Faitfor which he suffer'd, was
more than he ordinarily did, or than we everfind he ventur'd
to do before, for here he was both Thief and Thief-Catcher
too, which he did not usually venture. But a secret Infatua-
tion was now upon him,and Heavenwhohad determined his
Fate, no doubt left him to Expose himself more in this one Ac-
tion, than he had done in many Years before, and by this he
Fell.
IT is said, that if this had notfix'd him, there were other
Facls charg'd which would effettually have done; to that we
shall say nothing, because those others have not been try'd.
'Tis enough, Jonathan dy'd not in his own way of Thief-
Catching, but by going out of his Road and taking a Share in
the Robbery as he did after in the Reward: And here he was
taken in his own Snarejorthevery Thieves he employ'd, were
the Witnesses that Hang'd him. But we say no more of that,
till we come to the Story itself. We now proceed to the particu-
lar Account of his Life.
THE LIFE AND
Eminent Actions, &c.
JONATHAN WILD the wretched Subject of this
History, was born at Wolverhampton in Stafford-
shire ;andtodo Justice to his Original, his Parents, tho'
mean, had the repute of Honest and Industrious People,
his Father being a Carpenter, and his Mother sold Herbs
and Fruit in the Market of Wolverhampton: They had
three Sons, and two Daughters; the two Daughters are
yet living and Married to honest Tradesmen in Wolver-
hampton, one to a Comb-Maker, and the other a Buckle-
Maker, and whose Characters we do not hear are any way
Blemish'd; but the Sons have all a different Fame.
The Brothers I say were three in Number, Jonathan,
John and Andrew: John was a publick Officer in theTown
where they Liv'd, being the Cryer of Wolverhampton; but
stepping out of his Employment in the time of the late
Preslon Rebellion, and making himself popular by Head-
ing and appearing among the Rabble, for pulling down
the Meeting-House at Wolverhampton; he was taken up
for a Rioter, brought to L O ND O N, and put into Cus-
tody of a Messenger, where he continued some time, till
he was sent down again in Custody to Stafford, to be try'd
at the Assizes held there for the County: There he was
Convicted, and receiv'd Sentence to be publickly Whipt,
and afterwards to lye in Prison for a certain Time, which
Sentence was accordingly Executed: But the same John
being afterwards at Liberty, the time of his Imprison-
ment being expir'd, Dyed about four Years ago, as did
also his Mother much about the same Time, that is to
say, within a Month of One another.
The younger Brother Andrew being by Trade a Birm-
ingham Ware-man, or in particular a Buckle-Maker; left
his own Country and came up to London; what Trade he
has driven here we shall not meddle with, the Man being
yet alive; and as we are not writing his Story, but that of
his elder Brother, so we are not willing to enter into any
thing that may be prejudicial to particular Persons on any
Account whatever; 'tis enough to say, that we hear he is
at this Time a Prisoner in the Poultry-Compter for Debt;
so that it seems, all the three Brothers have had some ac-
quaintance with the inside of a Goal, tho' on different
Accounts.
JONATHAN as I have said, was the eldest Brother,
he was born about the year 1683, being at the time of his
Execution, about two and forty years of Age, of which
something more than thirteen years has been spent in the
most exquisite Villainies, of which we shall give some
Account in this Work.
H1s Education was suitable to his Father's Circum-
stances, being taught in the Free-School of Wolverhamp-
ton, to read and write, and then his Father put him Ap-
prentice to a Birmingham Man, or as they call them there,
a Hardware Man, and particularly a Buckle Maker.
Authors are not agreed in the Name of his Master,
and as it is not Material, we also let it pass without any
Notice; having serv'd his Time out, or as some say but
part of it, he got into the Service of one Counsellor Daniei
oiStaffordshire, and came up with him to London as his
servant; this was about the year 1704. But whether he
did not please his Master, or that he took ill Courses so
early, we have not enquir'd; but that Counsellor dismiss-
inghim,hewent home again to Wolverhampton, and very
honestly work'd for some time at his Trade.
But his Thoughts, as he said, being above his Trade,
tho' at that time had he no Tast of the Life he afterwards
led, yet he grew uneasie in the Country, was sick of his
Work, and in short, after a few Years came away to Lon-
don, to see if he could get into any Business there.
Here he found but little Encouragement, and tho' he
Work'd at his Trade, yet what he could get at his day
Labour, but ill serv'd to maintain him, whose Temper
even then, was not much given to Frugality, which with
his being not enclin'd to sit very close to his Work nei-
ther, made him run out pretty much, till at length it was
his Misfortune to be Arrested for Debt, and carried to
Wood-slreet Compter.
Here he suffer'd great hardship, having no Friends to
help him out, or Money to maintain him within, so that
he was on the Common-side, and far'd as other People in
those Circumstances do fare, that is to say, very hard.
However, after having lain a long time there, he at
length having behaved himself well enough among the
Prisoners, got so much Favour with the Keepers, that he
got the Liberty of the Gate, as they call it.
H1s Business here was chiefly to attend in the Night,
in Case any Prisoners were brought in for Disorders in
the Street; to wait upon them, and guard them with the
Officers to any Justice of the Peace, and so back again if
they were Committed; and in this, he Discharg'd him-
self to Satisfaction, so that he was at length trusted to go
of Errands, and the like Liberties to get a Penny.
Among the great variety of Night-walking Offenders
which came into his Custody, at length there comes in
one Mary Milliner, who after having been carried before
a Justice, might be remanded to the Compter for the pre-
sent ; but being a Jade of some Fame, she soon found her
way out again, for we do not find she was reckoned to be a
Prisoner there at all.
Whether it was that she was frequently brought in
there in her Night Rambles, and might receive some Fa-
vours from him on that Occasion, it being much in his
way to favour such as she was, he being as a kind of Keep-
er set over them; or whether they Contracted a Friend-
ship at first sight, or what other incident brought it about
I know not; but Mr. Wild not only became acquainted
with her, but a more than common Intimacy soon grew
between them; insomuch, that she began to teach him a
great many New, and to him unknown Ways of getting
Money, and brought him into her own Gang, whether of
Thieves or Whores, or of both, is not much Material.
By the Advantage of this new Correspondence Mr.
Wild soon clear'd himself of his Imprisonment, the Debt
for which he was thrust into the Compter being but small;
and tho' he had a Wife at that time living at Wolverhamp-
ton, and had a Son by her, which Son is still living, as we
shall hear presently; and tho' this new Favourite he had
pitch'd upon, had also a Husband then living, a Water-
man by his Profession; yet they pretended to be Married
and liv'd together some time as Man and Wife, and this
we are to call his second Wife, for he had six of them in
all. This Mrs. Millineras I am inform'd is still living, so
that Mr. Wild has left several Widows behind him at his
Exit, whether they go by his Name or not, that he him-
self could not inform us.
During his Intimacy with this Mrs. Milliner, and by
her means he grew Acquainted with some other of the
wicked ways of Living which, it seems she practis'd be-
sides that of Whoring: And first it seems she carried him
out with her upon the TWANG: This is One of the
Cant Words for those who attend upon the Night-walk-
ing Ladies in their Progress, and who keep at a distance,
that if the Lady they are employ'd by, happens to fall
into any Broil, they may come in timely to her Assistance,
and making a Noise and a Quarrel, if possible fall a Fight-
ing, and so give her an Opportunity to walk off, which
Jonathan often practis'd with good Success.
He improv'd his time during his Acquaintance with
this Mary Milliner to a very great Degree, for she brought
him acquainted with several Gangs, or Societies of the
Sharping an d Thieving World, in so much, that in a little
time he knew all their several Employments, and the se-
veral Parts they Acted, their Haunts and their Walks,
how they perform'd, and how they manag'd their Effects
when they had met with Success: And as he seem'd to set
up for a Director to them, under the Government of that
Dextrous Lady his first InsTructor, so he found ways to
make himself as useful to them as if he had gone Abroad
with them, which however he always avoided: Nor, in-
deed, had he any occasion to run a Hazard himself, he
finding himself as much a gainer in the Part he Acled, as
if he had shar'd in the Adventure: So that, in a Word, He
had the Profit without the Danger; and politically kept
himself from the Last, on pretence of his encreasing the
First, by his Art in managing for them.
Thus without being a Thief or a Receiver, he brought
a Gain to himself, andhis Business went on Prosperously.
How he and his Lady parted after this, is a Story,which
has nothing Extraordinary in it; 'tis enough to say, that
Johnathan became such a Proficient in his Business, that
he stood no longer in need of her Instructions; and as she
had a Trade of her own, which he began to be sick of as-
sisting her in, they made no difficulty of separating, with
as little Ceremony as they came together.
Tho' I do not find but that they kept a kind of remote
Correspondence after they were separated, as to Cohabi-
tation ; and the other Trade was carried on with mutual
Assistance, as well as to mutual Advantage, for some
time. And here it is very Remarkable, That tho' during
this Intercourse of Mr. Wild among these loose People
(as above) many of them dayly fell into the Hand of Jus-
tice, and some went off the Stage,the High Road, (as they
call it) that is to say, by the Gallows; yet none of them had
any thing to say to Jonathan, or to his She Friend, Mrs.
Milliner: but these always did their Business so Clean,
with such Subtilty, and so much to the Advantage of the
Criminals, that it was of no Use to them to charge him or
her with any Thing.
In this dextrous way of Managing, it came frequently
in his way, where any Thing of Value was Stolen, to make
it worth more Money, both to himself and to the Thief
that had Stolen it, by his private Ways; which at the same
time the Criminal knew nothing of. The Case was thus.
It is not to be doubted, that when a Robbery was com-
mitted, the Thieves sometimes run as much Hazard in
securing what they had got, as they did in the getting of
it, and often times much more; nay, they were very often
discovered and detected in their Attempts, to turn what
they had got into Money, or to sell and dispose of it, when
they had escaped the Danger of the Fact it self, and come
off Clean.
There was a Time indeed, when there were Brokers
and Receivers, whose Business it was to take every Thing
off of their Hands as soon as they had gotten it; and a
young Shop-lifter or House-breaker had no sooner got a
Booty, but he knew where to go and carry it in, as to a
Warehouse or Repository; where he was sure to have
Money for it, and that something near the Value of it too;
and this was a great Encouragement to the Light-finger'd
Gang: So that when it was a Misfortune of a Family or
Person to lose any Goods, they were effedtually lost, and
seldom or never were they heard of any more.
But there being an Act past in the Reign of the late
King William, making it Felony to buy or receive any
Stolen Goods,knowing them to be Stolen; and one or two
bold People having suffered on that very Account; the
Receiving Trade was spoil'd all at once. And when the
poor Adventurer had, at the hazard of his Neck, gotten
any Purchase, he must run all that Hazard over again to
turn it into Money.
lTistrue,aftersometime,theTemptationbeingstrong,
andtheProfits great,there werePersons frequently found
again that did help the Adventurers and took of their
goods; but then the Thief got so small a Share, that the
Encouragement was very small; and had it continued so,
the Thieving Trade might (for ought I know) have been
vol. 11 r
L1fe and Act1ons
in danger of being lost: For the Receivers running so ex-
treme a Hazard, they got all the Profit; and the poor Lift-
er or House-breaker was glad to part with Things of the
greatest Value for a Trifle.
But Jonathan and his Director, soon found out a Way
to encourage the Trade again, and to make it worth while
as theycall'dit,and the first Method was this: When a
Purchase was made, Jonathan enquir'd first where it was
gotten, what House had been robb'd, or, who had lost
the Goods; and having learn'd that, his next Business was
to have the Goods deposited in proper Places, always
avoiding the receiving them himself, or bringing himself
Then he found out proper Instruments to employ to
go to the Persons, who had been robb'd, and tell them,
that if they could describe what they had lost, they be-
liev'd they could help them to them again, for that there
was a parcel of stolen Goods stopt by an honest Broker, to
whom they were offered to be sold, and if their Goods
were among them they might have them again for a small
matter of Expence.
The People who had been robb'd, it may be suppos'd
were always willing enough to hear of their Goods again,
and very thankful to the Discoverer, and so readily gave
an Account of the Things they had lost, with such proper
Descriptions of them as were needful; The next Day they
should be told; there was such or such Part of their Goods
stopt among other Goods, which it was supposed were
stolen from other People, and so upon Assurance given
on both Sides to make no Enquiry into the particular Cir-
cumstances of stopping the Goods, and a Consideration
to the Person who went between, for helping the Loser to

his Goods again,the Things were restor'd,and the Person
receiv'd abundance of Thanks and Acknowledgments
for their Honesty and Kindness; and this part always fell
to Jonathan, or his Mistress Milliner, or perhaps both,
who always pretended they got nothing for their Pains
but the Satisfaction of having help'd the People to recov-
er their own again, which was taken by a Company of Ro-
gues ; professing their Sorrow that they had not had the
good Luck at the same time to detect the Rogues that
took them, and bring them to the Punishment they de-
serv'd.
On the other hand, they acted as safe a Part with the
Thief also, for rating and reproving the Rogue for his
Villany, they would pretend to bring them to an honest
Restoring the Goods again, taking a reasonable Consid-
eration for their Honesty, and so bring them to lodge
them in such Place as should be directed; and sometimes,
as I have been told, he has officiously caused the Thief, or
Thieves, to be taken with the Goods upon them, when he
has not been able to bring them to comply, and so has
made himself both Thief and Chapman, as the Proverb
says; getting a Reward for the Discovery, and bringing
the poor Wretch to the Gallows too, and thisonly because
he could not make his Market of him to his Mind; but I
must be so just to Jonathan too, as to say he did not ac-
knowledge this, so that this Part was not had from his
own Mouth, yet perhaps it may not be the less true, nor
do I think it would be very hard to prove the Fact.
As to the other Part, he was never backward to own
that it was his early Practice, and boasted of it as doing a
piece of Service which none but himself could manage,
and that he thereby assisted honest People intherecovery
of their own; how far he acted honestly in the doing it,
supposing he had no hand in the Robbery itself, I leave
to the Casuists to determine; no Question, in their New-
gate Divinity, they might think it a mighty honest way of
getting Money, for as to the Encouragement it was to
the Robbery itself, while the Thief knew before hand
how to come off of the Guilt and get Money in his Pocket,
that they gave their Thoughts no trouble about.
This Trade I found by his own Discourse he carry'd
on a great while, and had he gone no farther, I question
whether it had been in any Man's Power to havehurthim
to the last; nay, or that even the Laws would have reach'd
his Life, notwithstanding the late Act which seem'd to be
calculated on purpose to put a stop to his Trade: But he
knew no Bounds to his Gain, and therefore knew no Re-
straint of Laws, or at least considered of none, till he in-
volved himself in a mass of Crimes, out of which it was
impossible he should recover.
But to return to the first Part of this unjust Commerce,
which, whatever Gloss he might put upon it, was no other
than an encouraging Rogues to rob and plunder, and
then demanding Money for them to bring back what
they had stolen, out of which he secur'd always a Share
for himself. ThisPracticeof giving People notice of their
Goods after they were robb'd becoming pretty Publick,
and especially several People recovering their lost Goods
u pon the easie Conditions of giving a Gratuity to the Dis-
coverer, being known, it introduced another weak fool-
ish Practice as a Consequence, namely, that after this,
when any Person was robb'd, they always publish'd the
Particulars of their lost Goods, with the Promise of a Re-
ward to those who should discover them: It [is] reason-
able indeed to suppose that this might occasion a Discov-
ery one way or other, either by the Thieves betraying one
another, or else by directing the Buyers of Goods, who
were honestly inclin'd, to stop such Goods if they came to
be offered, and hence it was a usual Practice in such Ad-
vertisements to add, that if such Goods were offered to be
sold or pawn'd, they were desir'd to stop both the Goods
and the Persons, and give notice so and so, as directed.
But this was every Way an ineffectual Method, and
indeed the latter part was particularly so, for, indeed it
was neither more or less than giving a Caution to the
Thief, not to venture to offer any thing he had gotten to
Sale, for he should be sure to be stopt as well as the Goods;
and indeed it was strange, that the People who publish'd
such Advertisements should not foresee the making such
a Publication would be an effectual shutting the Door
against the Discovery they designed it for, and was there-
fore nothing but a throwing good Money after bad.
On the other hand,neitherwas the advertizing or Pub-
lishing their Loss any real Service, or of any use to the
Loser, for that the only Person who could assist in the
Recovery of the Goods, was quite out of the Question,
having no need of the Information, but coming by his In-
telligence another Way, viz. from the Thief himself; and
that if there had been no such Information, I mean by
publick Print, he would, as usual, have been sure to have
sent an Account to the Loser, and have come to a Treaty
with him another Way; for the Thief giving an Account
to Mr. Jonathan Wild where the Robbery was commit-
ted, and whose Goods they were, the cunning Artist al-
ways made Application to the Loser first; and if it was
asked, how they come to know who the Goods were taken
from? it was always answer'd ,That it was meerly Provi-
dential; being, by meer Accident, at a Tavern, or at a
Friend's House in the Neighbourhood, they heard that
such a Gentleman had his house broken open, and such
and such Goods Stolen, and the like.
This was so plausible a Story, and carryed so much an
appearance of Truth with it, that it left Room for no En-
quiry: But on the other hand, if the People, to whom the
Discovery was made, were too Inquisitive, the Party sent,
presently seem'd to take it 111, and reply'd, Sir, I come to
serve you, if you think to make any Discovery by me, of
the Thieves that robb'd you, I must tell you, that you are
Mistaken: I converse with no such Cattle; I can give a
very good Account of my self to you, or any Body else: I
only come to tell you that some Goods, being offer'd to
Sale by a suspected Hand; the Person to whom they
were offer'd, had the Honestyto slop them, andthe Good-
ness to give you some Notice of it, that you may see whe-
ther your Goods are among them or not; if this is not
enough to oblige you, I have done. If you have any thing
to say to me, or think to talk to me about the Thief or
Thieves that robb'd you, I have no more to say to you, but
to let you know, my Name is so and so; and I live in such
a Place, if you have any thing to say to me, I am to be
found, Sir, at any Time. And thus they take their leave in
a Huff. And this never fails to bring the Enquirer to a
better Temper; and either immediately, or soon after, to
treat them with more Civility//
And indeed the offer itself appears so Good, and the
appearance so above Board, that not a Magistrate, or
Justice of Peace, could find the least Flaw in it: Only en-
quire where the Goods are which are stopt, in whichCase,
a Place and Person is named, and Goods produced when
any one is sent to view them; but then the Party so Cavil-
ing at that offer, is sure to find none of his own Goods
among them: And so being lost as it were in a Wood, he
is perfectly amused, and has not one Word to say; for he
neither sees his own Goods, nor knows that the other
Goods are stolen, much less by who or from who: And
thus by his being too Curious, or rather Impertinent, he
loses his Goods entirely, and has no second Offer made
him.
It must be confess'd, Jonathan play'd a sure Game in
all this; and therefore it is not to be wonder'd at that he
went on for so many Years without any Disaster: Nay, he
acquir'd a strange, and, indeed, unusual Reputation, for
a mighty honest Man, till his Success hardened him to
put on a Face of publick Service in it; and for that Pur-
pose, to profess an open and bare Correspondence among
the Gangs of Thieves; by which his House became an
Office of Intelligence for Enquiries of that Kind; as if all
Stolen Goods had been deposited with him, in order to be
restor'd.
But even this good Character of his, as it did not last
long, so neither did it come all at once; and some tell us
(how true it is, I will not affirm) that he was oblig'd to
give up every now and then one or two of his Clients to
the Gallows, to support his rising Reputation: In which
cases, he never fail'd to proclaim his own Credit in bring-
ing Offenders to Justice, and in delivering his Country
from such dangerous People.
Some have gone so far as to tell us the very Particulars
which recommended any of the Gangs to him for a Sacri-
fice, and to divide them into Classes: For example, (1.)
such as having committed the Secret of a Fad: to him, yet
would not submit their Purchase to his Disposal; or (2.)
would not accept reasonable Terms of Composition for
restoring the Goods; or (3 .)used any threatningSpeeches
against their Comrades: These he would immediately
cause to be apprehended, he knowing both their Haunts,
and where the Goods were deposited; and in such Cases,
none so vigilant in the Discovery, or so eager in appre-
hending the Thief: And, generally speaking, he had his
ways and means to bring in others of the Gang, to come
in and Confess, that they might Impeach the Person so
intended to be given up to Justice.
This, I say some have affirmed was his Practise, and
assured me of the Truth of it; and that in these Cases, they
add, That he managed with such Dexterity, that he al-
ways obtain'd publick Applause, as a mighty forward
Man to delect the Villanies of those People, and bring
Offenders to Justice.
How many he murthered in that manner, for as his
End was only making a Sacrifice to his own Interest and
Fame, I can call it no other: I say, how many they were, I
cannot learn; but if ithas been a Practice of somany Years
standing,and so frequent in thatTime,itcannotbedoubt-
ed but the Number has been very considerable; nor does
it a little contribute to the belief of the Thing, that the fra-
ternity of Thieves in general were of late so exasperated
against him; for tho' the Method was in it self wicked in
him, yet it certainly brought a great many Criminals to
just Condemnation, who would otherwise have liv'd to
do much more Mischief than they did.
And this occasion'd him doubtless to push on with the
more Heat and Fury against those who stood in his way,
and where he could exert his Power without fear of being
Touch'd himself, as particularly against the late J. Shep-
pard, Blueskin, and others, in the taking, re-taking, and
prosecuting of whom, he was very Officious; while at the
same time those audacious Criminals exclaim'd against
him, as a Man who had [been] the first great Encourager
of their Villanies, or at least had been instrumental to
draw them into the very Practice it self; in Revenge for
which, the said Blueskin bid fair for giving Jonathan his
quietus in the very Face of Justice. But his Fate was to dye
with more Infamy than he would have gone off with, if he
had been sent off at that Time.
But to return to the History it self, what ever was at
the bottom of his Designs, 'tis evident, he had two very
clear Pretences for what he did; and on these two Pre-
tences, it was that he supported the Credit of all his mon-
strous doings, and which indeed no Man but himself
could have shown his Face in; 1. The Publick Good, in
taking and apprehending the most open and notorious
Criminals ;and, 2.Theprocuringandrestoring the Goods
again to the right Owners, which had been stolen from
them either by Fraud or Violence.
It was allowed, that neither of these could be done ef-
fectually, as Jonathan did them, but by an avowed Inti-
macy and Acquaintance among the Gangs and Societies
of Thieves of every sort; and it was very hard to Imagine,
that such an Intimacy could be maintain'd without being
really a Party to their Management, and without a crimi-
nal Correspondence with them in the very Facts: And
Jonathan was often told so, as well by those who believed
him really guilty of such a criminal Correspondence, as
those that did not.
But be that as it will, Jonathan himself always deny'd
it, and insisted not only on his Innocence, but on his
Merit: And that as he was indeed acquainted with the
wicked ways made use of by all the several Classes of
Thieves, and by consequence with many of them Person-
ally, he only made use of that Acquaintance, to perswade
and prevail upon them, when good Rewards were offer'd
for it, to restore the Goods to the People who had lost
them; placing himself so only in the middle, between the
Loser and the Robber, as to capitulate for the latter, that
if the Goods were return'd, the Loser would keep Pro-
mise, and give a Reward without Enquiry into the Par-
ticulars, or Persons, which would otherways put an end
to all Restorings or Returnings of Stolen Goods for ever
after.
This Part he insisted on as not only very Honest but
very Serviceable; always insisting that whatever he took
on either side, was no otherwise than as a Sollicitor takes
his Fee, on Consideration from both Parties, for honestly
putting an end to a Law-suit, and bringing the contend-
ing Parties to a friendly Accommodation; and had he
gone no farther, I cannot say but hemightbeintheRight:
But he acted in a more difficult Station, as placing him-
self in the middle, between the Law and the Offender, in
a manner, commuting the Felony, and making a kind of
Composition where the Facl: wasPunishable ;whichPun-
ishment no Man had Power to anticipate, but the Hand
above, which had Power also to remit the Penalty; name-
ly, the supreame Magistrate.
It must be allow'd to Jonathan's Fame, That as he
steer'd among Rocks and dangerous Shoals, so he was a
bold Pilot; he ventur'd in, and always got out in a manner
equally surprising; no Man ever did the like before him,
and I dare say, no Man will attempt to do the like after
him: Two Things indeed favour'd him; (1.) The wil-
lingness the Government always shows to have Criminals
Detected, and brought to Justice. And, (2 .)The Willing-
ness of the People who had been Robb'd, and lost Things
of considerable Value, to get their Goods again.
I. The willingness of the Governmentto bring Rogues
to their Reward, as well to Punish the Persons, as to dis-
courage the Crime; all just Governments discover a Dis-
position to bring Offenders to Justice: And oh this ac-
count, they not only receive and accept of Informations
of the worst of Crimes, from the worst of Criminals, and
Knowledge of the Offence from the Offenders themsel-
ves, but encourage such Criminals to come in and confess
the Offence, and Discover their Accomplices, Promising
as well Pardon for the Crimes, as a Reward for the Dis-
covery, even to those who are Guilty. Now this willing-
ness of the Government to detect Thieves, seem'd to be a
kind of Authority, for Jonathan in his vigorous persuit of
those who he thought fit to have Punished; tho' 'tis true,
it was no Authority to him to draw poor Fellows first into
the Crime, that he might afterwards obtain a Reward
from the Government for Detecting and Apprehending
them, and there indeed is the nice turn of Jonathan's
Case, and which indeed has turn'd him off of the Stage at
long run, as we shall see in its Place.
He continued in the prosperous part of his Business
about ten Year, without being so publickly taken notice
of, or making himself so famous as he has been lately; and
in this time it was not doubted but he got a large stock of
Money, as well as of Credit; and had he contented him-
self with the same Cautious wary Way of Acting, which
his first Instructor introduc'd him by, he might have
grown Rich, and been safe too; but as he was of a push-
ing, enterprizing Nature, he could content himself with
nothing but every thing he could get, nor could he act
moderately in any part of his Conduct.
In this time of his Prosperity, he Married athird Wife,
(his two former, if they were Wives, being still living) her
Name was Elizabeth Man, who tho' she was a Woman of
the Town, was yet a very sensible and agreeable Person;
and her short History is this: He lov'd her above all the
other Women he had taken for Wives, and liv'd publick-
ly with her, which he did not with any of the rest; he had
no Children by her, but she was as he himself Confess'd,
a true Penitent for all her former Life, and made him an
excellent Wife; she expiated her former bad Life by a
formal full Confession and Pennance, having on that Oc-
casion been perswaded to turn Roman Catholic, and hav-
ing receiv'd Absolution from her Confessor, liv'd a very
sober Life for some Years, after which she Died, and was
buried at St. Pancrass in the Fields; and Jonathan retain'd
such an impression of the Sanctity and goodness of this
Wife, that he never forgot it as long as he liv'd; and
order'd himself to be Buried close to her when he Died,
which his Friends took care to see perform'd, about Two
of the Clock in the Morning.
He had two Wives as they are call'd, besides this; and
after her Death, who I understand, he did not live with,
or not long at a Time, (viz.)
Sarah Parrin, alias GregsJone, who I understand is yet
living.
Judith Nun by whom he had a Daughter, who is now
about ten Years of Age, and the Mother also still liv-
Bes1des those five, he Married his Sixth and last Wife
about seven Year ago, and with whom he liv'd to the
Time of his Execution; her Maiden Name was Mary
Brown, but when he took her to Wife, her Name was
Mary Dean, being the Widow or Relict, of Skull Dean, a
Man of the Trade who was executed for House-break-
ing, that is to say, for Burglary, about the Year 1716 j or
1717: Some have tax'd Jonathan with being Instrument-
al to the Execution of this Dean, her said first Husband,
that he might have theLiberty to make Court to his Wife,
but he deny'd it possitively,and[I] see no room for such a
Reproach. I shall not reflect on his Memory, without
good Evidence.
The said Skull Dean, Mrs. Wild's, first Husband, was
a very dextrous Fellow in his Calling, and particularly
expert in breaking into Houses: After he was condemn'd
he got out of the Prison, on pretence of going to the Ne-
cessary-house, and being gotten quite clear for a little
while, he made his way as far as Guiltspur-ftreet, towards
Smithfield, but being pursued by the Keepers, and having
his Fetters on, he could not go long undiscovered, so they
over-took him, and carryed him back to Prison.
Th1s Mrs. Dean is his present apparent Relict; she
has had the mortification to have had two Husbands, and
both Hang'd; and was so affected with the Disaster of
this last, that as Jonathan himself declar'd a few Days be-
fore his Execution, she had twice attempted to destroy
herself, after she had the Account of his receiving Sen-
tence of Death.
He had no Children by this Sixth Venture; but we are
assur'd, she has been an extraordinary Wife to him on
many Accounts, and particularly in the way of his Busi-
ness, in which she could not be perfectly unacquainted,
having had so extraordinary a Husband before; tho' we
do not find that Jonathan himself wanted any Assistance,
being by this Time perfect Master of his Trade.^^
In the time of this Wife, or on the Marrying her, he
removed from his former Lodging, (a House in the Little
Old Baily, where his said Wife had liv'd before) and took
a House in the Great Old Baily, and there he liv'd to the
last; and in no mean Figure neither, for his Wife made a
very good Appearance; and as to Jonathan, he carryed on
a very flourishing Business, as the Town well knows.
He was now Master of his Trade, Poor and Rich
flock'd to him: If any Thing was Lost,(whether by Negli-
gence in the Owner, or Vigilance and Dexterity in the
Thief) away we went to Jonathan Wild. Nay, Advertise-
ments were Publish'd, directing the Finder of almost
every Thing, to bring it to Jonathan Wild, who was emi-
nently impower'd to take it, and give the Reward.
How Infatuate were the People of this Nation all this
while? Did they consider, that at the very time that they
treated this Person with such a Confidence, as if he had
been appointed to the Trade? He had, perhaps, the very
Goods in his keeping, waiting the Advertisement for the
Reward; and that, perhaps, they had been Stolen with
that very Intention?
It was not a little Difficult to give his Eminence his
true Title; he was, indeed, call'd a Thief-Catcher, and on
some extraordinary Occasions, he was so, as in the Case
of Sheppard, Blueskin, and others: But this was no Ex-
planation of his Business at all, for his Profits came in an-
other way, not in catching the Thief, but more properly,
in Catching (that is, Biting) the Persons robb'd: As for
the Thief, it was not his Business to catch him, as long as
he would be subjected to his Rules; that is to say, as often
as he had committed any robbery, to bring it to him, to be
restor'd to the Owner.
If the Correspondence he kept was large, If the Num-
ber of his Instruments was very great, his dexterity in
Managing them, was indeed wonderful: And how clea-
verly he kept himself out of the reach of the Act for re-
ceiving Stolen Goods, mentioned above, is hardly to be
Imagin'd; and yet we find he was never charg'd Home
'till now; notwithstanding so many Fellons who he ex-
asperated to the last Degree,and made Desperate, by fall-
ing upon them to their Destruction.
ItIs true, the young Generation of Thieves, who as we
may say liv'd under him, were always kept low and poor,
and could not subsist but by the Bounty of their Gover-
nour; and when they had a Booty of any Bulk, or Value,
they knew not what to do with it, but to deposite it, and
get some Money for the present Use, and then have a lit-
tle more upon its being disposed the right way.
For the managing this Part, he had his particular Ser-
vants to take and receive, so that Jonathan receiv'd no-
thing, deliver'd nothing, nor could any thing be fasten'd
on him to his hurt, I mean for receiving stolen Goods, and
yet as things stood, almost all the stolen Goods were
brought to him, and put into his Hands.
He openly kept his Compting House, or Office, like a
Man of Business, and had his Books to enter every thing
in with the utmost Exactness and Regularity: When you
first came to him to give him an Account of any thing
Lost, it was hinted to you, That you must first deposite a
Crown, this was his Retaining Fee; Then you were ask'd
some needful Questions, that is to say needful, not for his
Information, but for your Amusement; as where you
liv'd, where the Goods were Lost, whether out of your
House, or out of your Pocket, or whether on the High-
way, and the like; and your Answers to them all were
Minuted down, as if in order to make a proper Search and
Inquiry;whereas perhaps the very Thing you came to en-
quire after, was in the very Room where you were, or not
far off: After all this Grimace was at an end, you were de-
sir'd to call again, or send in a day or two, and then you
should know whether he was able to do you any Service
or no, and so you were dismiss'd.
At your second coming, you had some Encourage-
ment given you, that you would be serv'd, but perhaps
the Terms were a little rais'd upon you, and you were told
the Rogue that had it was Impudent, that he insisted it
was worth so much, and he could sell it when he would
for double the Money you offer'd; and that if you would
not give him such a Sum, he would not treat with you;
however, says Jonathan, if I can but come to the Speech
of him, I'll make him be more reasonable.
The next time he tells you, that all he can bring the
Rogue to is, that Guineas being paid to the Porter
who shall bring the Goods, and a Promise upon Honour
that nothing shall be said to him, but just take and give;
the gold Watch, or the Snuff-Box, or whatever it is, shall
be brought to you by such a time exactly; and thus upon
mutual Assurances the Bargain is made for restoring the
Goods.
But then it remains to be ask'd, what Mr. Wild ex-
pects for his Pains in managing this nice Part, who an-
swers with an air of Greatness, he leaves it to you; that he
gets nothing by what is to be given the Porter, that he is
satisfyed in being able to serve Gentlemen in such a Man-
ner, so that it is in your Breast to do what you think is
handsome by Mr. Wild, who has taken a great deal of
Pains in it to do you a Service.
It must be confess'd that in all this, if there was no
more than is mention'd, such a Part might be Acted on
all Sides without any Guilt fasten'd any where but on the
Thief: For Example,a House is robb'd,or a Lady has lost
her Gold Watch: Jonathan by his Intelligence among the
Gang, finds out who has done it; that is to say, he is told
'tis such a one; 'tis no matter how he hears it, he is not
bound to the Discovery upon a hear-say; nor is he oblig'd
to prosecute a Felony committed on he does not know
who, by he knows not who, that's none of his Business.
However, having a kind of Knowledge of the Person,
he sends to him, to let him know, that if he is his own
Friend, he will carry, that is, sendthe Watch,or the Cane,
or the Snuff-box, so, and so, to such a Place; and that if he
does so, and the Porter receives ten Guineas, or more, or
less, whatever it is that is offered, all will be well; if not,
he adds a Threatning, that he will be prosecuted with the
utmost Severity.
Upon this, the Thief sends the Goods,has the Money,
and never sees Jonathan, nor any Person else: What can
Jonathan be charg'd with, in such an Affair as this? I must
confess I do not see it; no, nor if the Thief sends him a
present of four or five Guineas out of the Money, provid-
ed as he said it is without any Conditions made before-
hand, or being present, at the Time 'tis done.
vol. 11 s
Nor, on the other hand, does the treating for deliver-
ing the Goods, as above, with a second or third Person
give any Room to fix any Thing on Jonathan: So that, in
short, he treats both with the Thief and with the Person
robb'd, with the utmost safety and security. Indeed I do
not see why he might not have carryed on such a Com-
merce as this, with the greatest Ease, I do not say Hon-
esty, in the World, if he had gone no farther; for he took
none of your Money for restoring your Goods neither did
he restore you any Goods; you gave him Money indeed
for his Trouble in enquiring out the Thief, and for using
his Interest by awing or perswading to get your stolen
Goods sent you back, telling you what you must give to
the Porter that brings them, if you please, for he does not
oblige you to give it.
But the Danger lay on the other side of the Question,
namely,not being contented with what thePerson robb'd
gave upon the Foot of a grateful Acknowledgement, for
trouble; but impudently taking the Goods of the Thief,
sending the Porter himself, taking the Money, and then
capitulating with theThief,for such aPart of the Reward;
and then this Thief coming in against him as a Witness.
This was the very Case in the Fact upon which Jonathan
miscarried.
So that in a Word, Jonathan's Avarice hang'd him. It
is true, in the Case he was try'd for, it was Apparent that
he set the Robbery, as they express it; that is, he directed
the Persons to the Place, nay, went with them to show
them the Shop, described the Woman and the Business;
and after all, receiv'd the Goods, and gave them the Mo-
ney for returning them, reserving it in his own Power to
take what more he pleas'd for himself; and at last all this
being testifyed by the Thieves themselves.
It is not to be doubted, but Jonathan, to carry on this
Commerce to such a Highth as he really had rais'd it, had
a perfect Understanding with all the profess'd Thieves
in the Town; at least the young Beginners, for these are a
Class generally more out of his Power than others, and
who are not so easily to be governed as the others are; and
yet he finds ways to Influence them too in the way of their
Practice. But the rest, I say, he had in his Reach mahag'd
them as he thought fit; nay, he generally knew, or perhaps
appointed them the Quarter they should walk in; so that
when ever any Person came to Enquire for his Goods lost,
he could make a tollerable Guess at the Thief, by the part
of the Town you liv'd in, or where you were when you
lost it.
I remember I had occasion, in a Case of this Kind, to
wait upon Mr. Jonathan with a Crown in my Hand, as a-
bove, and having made a Deposite, I was ask'd, as above,
where the Thing was lost ? At first he smil'd, and turning
to one, I suppose of his Instruments, who can this be?
says he, why all our People are gone down to Sturbridge
Fair; the other answer'd, after some pause, I think I saw
Lynx, in the Street, Yesterday: Did you, says he, then 'tis
that Dog, I warrant you. Well, Sir, says he, I believe we
can find out your Man; you shall know more of it, if you
let me see you again a Monday, this was on the Friday:
When the Monday came, truly I was told, they could not
see the young Rogue, and they believ'd he was gone after
the rest to the Fair, it being about the beginning of Sep-
tember.
After the Fair, I came again and again, but was put
off from time to time, and could not at last be serv'd in the
Case, it being only a Silver-hilted Sword, which the
Thief it seems had found means to turn into Money,
Life and Actions
and then there was no coming at it; the Time also hav-
ing been laps'd by his Honour, having been gone to the
Fair.
Another Person applying in another and more ma-
terial Affair, was treated with Respect by Mr. Wild, and
a Pot of Tea brought out in Form: (N.B. The Crown be-
ing firsl: deposited as usual) The Case related to a Gold
Watch, with Trinkits and some Diamonds about the
Watch, and the Lady offer'd very considerably, for the
restoring it, as I remember, 30/. but no Advertise-
ments had been publish'd. Mr. Wild, after the usual En-
quiries of when it was losl:? and where? And being told it
was at St. Anne's Church, Weslminsler, pauses a while,
and calls up a Servant, and asks aloud, where was M- - -11
K lalt Sunday? About WeffminSIer, says the Man,
but the Bi - -h would not tell where. Was she Crank? says
Mr. Wild. I don't know, says the Fellow. However, turn-
ing to the Lady, says he, Madam, I fancy I shall be able
to serve you, and perhaps for less money than your lady-
ship speaks of. If it be M UK g} that Woman, I
have in my Thoughts, as I believe 'tis, for she is a dex-
trous Jade at the Work, I'll have her safe before Morn-
ing. The Lady full of Compassion returns, O sir! don't
take her up; I assure you I won't prosecute, I'll rather
lose my Watch, than have any poor Wretch Hang'd for it.
Why? Madam, says Mr. Wild, Wecan'ttalkwithher,
but by Threatning: We musT: not make a Bargain with
her, that would be to compound a Felony. If I can per-
swade her to come and bring your Watch, and ask your
Pardon, will that satisfy you. Nay, says the Lady, I don't
know whether that would be safe,neither: If she will send
it me, I had rather; and I'll forgive her, without asking
Pardon. Well, Madam, will you take it, and give the
Porter that brings it 20 Guineas, if you please, but not to
oblige you to it. Whatever you say, Mi. Wild, says the
Lady. Well, Madam, says Mr. Wild, if I may have the
Honour to see your Ladyship again.
Lady. Will it not do if I send any Body?
Wild. Why, truly, no Madam: People that deal in
these Things, do not care for Witnesses.
Lady. Well, well, that's true: I'll come my self. What
Day would you have me come?
Wild. On Thursday, Madam.
Lady. Well, Mr. Wild, what must I do? What will
satisfy you for your Trouble?
Wild. It is time enough, Madam, to speak of thatwhen
I am sure I can do you any Service. These Creatures are
very loose, and I can't tell you how it may be.
[Lady.] Well,Mr. Wild, I'll come furnish'dto pay my
Respects to you
Wild. Madam, Your most obedient Servant.
[Waits on her to her coach.]
Accordingly, Thursday coming, the Lady appears.
Mr. Wild, in his Callimancoe Night-gown, (the same he
was hang'd in) receives her; and with a pleasant Look,
tells her, he is very glad, to be able to say, that he believes
he shall serve her. That it was the same Woman he sus-
pected, and that the Jade had already pawn'd the Watch
for some Money, but that it was but a little, and he was
glad she had.
Lady. Why, Mr. Wild.?
Wild. Because, Madam; if she had kept it all this
while, it would have been ten to one but she had Broke
something about it, or done it some Mischief.
Lady. That's true, indeed. Pray what has she Pawn'd
it for?
Wild. Not much, Madam, she has got but seven
Guineas upon it yet.
Lady. Well, Mr. Wild, what musl be done?
Wild. Why, Madam, If the People, that have it, bring
it safe and sound to your Ladyship, will you give me your
Honour that you will ask no Questions, or Hop the Per-
son that comes with it?
Lady. I promise you, on my Word, I will not.
Wild. The Man that brings it may be a poor Innocent
Fellow, that knows nothing of it.
Lady. Well, well, he shall have no Harm or Interrup-
tion from me.
Wild. Then I believe your Ladyship may hear some-
thing of it to Night.
Lady. And what must I give him?
Wild. I don't yet know, Madam, but I'll bring them
aslowas I can.Notabove2oGuineas,to besure,Madam.
Lady. That is very kind, indeed. Well, Mr. Wild, then
I'll make it up to you. [So the Lady Pulls out her Purse in
order to give him some Money."]
Wild. No, Madam, not a Farthing. Besides you have
not got your Watch yet: Pray slay till you see whether
the Jade will Perform; tho' I think, indeed, I am pretty
sure of her.
Lady. Well, I'll take your Word, Mr. Wild. [Offers
him Money again.]
Wild. By no Means, Madam; let me see if I can serve
you.
Lady. Well, Mr. Wild, if it musl: be so, I must come
again then.
Wild. It may be not. Will your Ladyship be pleas'd to
slay about half an Hour?
Lady. Ay, with all my Heart.
In about half an Hour, Jonathan having been call'd
hastily out, comes in again immediately. Madam, says
he, if your Ladyship pleases to go into your Coach, and
drive gently up Street, perhaps a Messenger may
desire to speak with you as you go along.
Very well, Mr. Wild, I understand you.
Upon the Lady's going along Street, a Ticket-
Porter, with his Hat in his Hand, shows himself by the
Coach-side, and the Lady taking the Hint, stops her
Coach, and lets down the Glass, and speaking totheFel-
low, says, Would you speak with me Friend?
The Fellow says not a Word, but delivers into her
Hand the Watch with all the Trinkits and Dimonds per-
fectly safe; and when she had look'd upon it a little, gives
her a Note, wherein was written nothing but thus in
Words at length,
Eighteen Guineas.
The Lady immediately tells out the Money to the
Porter, and he was going away: Hold! Honest Friend,
says the Lady, there's somewhat for your self; and gives
him half a Guinea, and so dismiss'd him.
A Day or two after she makes Mr. Wild a Visit, and
presents him with 15 Guineas more: But with greatDiffi-
culty made him accept of it; telling her it was a great deal
to much; that he would not take it by any means, but at
last accepts it, with the Ceremony of saying, he wouldnot
take it on account of the Watch, but for having been at
some Trouble in serving her Ladyship, in which she was
pleas'd to Reward him much more than he deserv'd;
when, at the same time 'twas very likely [he] had part of
the i8 Guineas too from M— UK—g, who he frighted
out of the Watch with threatning to have her put into
Newgate for stealing of it.
This may serve for a Sketch of Praftice, as I call it; and
to let the World see in what manner this Secret Service
was carryed on; how the Thieving Trade was managed,
how the People were gull'd out of their Money, and how
a Crew of Hell-born Rogues and Whores, which is much
the same, have been bred up to the Trade by their grand
Patron and Master of Art, Jonathan Wild. It would be
endless to give a particular of the many Tricks andCheats
of this Kind that he has manag'd, during a continued
Life of Wickedness, for about i6 Years, among which it
would be very Instructing, to give an accountof thenum-
bers of poor wretched Creatures, like himself; who he
having first led them on in the Road of Crime for several
Years, as long as they would be subservient to him, and
put all their Purchase into his Hands, abandon'd as soon
as they offer'd to set up for themselves, and leaving them
to the mercy of the Government,made himself the Instru-
ment of their Destruction, and then pleaded the Merit of
it to the Publick. But these require a long History, rather
than a Pamphlet, and therefore I wholly omit them.
It is time now to enter into a Particular Account of the
conclusion of this Life of Crime, it has been a kind of
Comedy, or a Farce rather all a long, but it prov'd a Tra-
gedy at last; and Jonathan being brought to Justice, has
summ'd up his Account here in a most ignominious End,
satisfyed how in a manner not uncommon only, but such
as History can not give one Instance of the like, except
lately, that of a Murther at St. Edmunds-Bury, in Suffolk.
The Sum of the matter is this, Jonathan had long been
- so Notorious, and his Practice, tho' not within the Com-
pass of the Law, was yet in its Nature so Criminal in it-
self, and above all, was so dangerous in its Example, that
the Publick began to be justly Alarm'd at it, and to con-
side of proper Measures for putting a stop to it, [for]
which purpose an Act of Parliament, (the only Remedy
for growing Evils of this kind) was pass'd the last Session
to make it Felony, to take or receive any Reward for the
restoring of any stolen Goods, knowing them to be
Stolen: The Clause in the said Act is as follows.
"And whereas there are several Persons who have se-
cret Acquaintance with Felons, and who make it their
Business to help Persons to their stol'n Goods, and by
that means gain Money from them, which is divided be-
tween them and the Felons, whereby they greatly encou-
rage such Offenders: Be it Enacted by the authority
aforesaid, That where ever any Person taketh Money or
Reward, directly or indiredtly, under pretence or upon
Account of helping any Person or Persons to any stol'n
Goods or Chattels, every such Person so taking Money
or Reward as aforesaid, (unless such Person do appre-
hend, or cause to be apprehended, such Felon who stole
the same, and cause such Felon to be brought to his Tryal
for the same, and give Evidence against him) shall be
Guilty of Felony, and suffer the Pains and Penalties of
Felony, according to the Nature of the Felony com-
mitted in stealing such Goods and Chattels, in the man-
ner and with such Circumstances as [if] the same were
stol'n."
This Act was so directly aim'd at Jonathan's general
Practice, that he could not be Ignorant enough not to see
L1fe and Act1ons
it; but least he should, a certain Honourable Person, too
just to favour him, and yet too human not to warn him of
his Danger that he might avoid it; gave him Notice that
this very Act was made against his unlawful Practice, and
therefore in time warn'd him, in few, but significant
Words, to take heed to himself and avoid the Conse-
quences by leaving off the Trade of Thief-Catching, as it
is unjustly call'd, that is, of compounding for the return
of stol'n Goods.
But good Advice to Jonathan Wild, was like talking
Gospel to akettle Drum, bidding a Dragoon not Plunder,
or talking of Compassion to a Hussar; he that was hard-
nedabovetheBasenessof all cautionary Fear, scorn'd the
Advice, and went on in his wicked Trade; not warily and
wisely as he had formerly done, but in short, with more
Impudence and shameless Boldness than evei, for as if he
despis'd Laws, and the Governours, and the provok'd
Justiceof the Nation: He now not only took Rewards for
returning Goods stolen, but even directed the Stealing of
them, and making himself a Party to the very Robberies
themselves; acted a Part of the Thief, and the Receiver
also; and this in so many Cases, that we are told if the In-
dictment had fail'd for which he was justly condemn'd,
there were several others ready to have been brought on,
and the Witnesses ready to have been produc'd for Proof
of the Facts.
But one Felony being fully prov'd was sufficient; and
upon a full Hearing he was Convicted in so evident a
Manner, that he really had nothing to say in his own Be-
half, not being able to deny the Fact; his Council would
have pleaded, that the Offence was not within the late
Statute upon which he was Indicted; but the Court an-
swer'd them fully, and over-ruled the Plea; so that being
allow'd to be within the Statute, and the Fact being fully
proved by several Witnesses, he receiv'd Sentence of
Death the 15th of May last.
The Circumstances of this Fact seem to be so agree-
able to the whole tenor of Jonathan's former Practice, and
so like other Parts of his Life, that we can not but observe
the Paralel,and conclude the particular Accountsof other
parts of his Life to be true likewise.
It has been said of him, that if ever he was mov'd to
promote any Man, or to help any Man to Business, which
he often pretended to do in Compassion to their Poverty,
that still he did it always in his own way, that is to say, en-
deavour'd to make Thieves of them, to bring them to be
Hang'd, to keep them from Misery, and to make New-
gate Birds of them, to keep them outof the Compters; this
he practis'd principally upon young Creatures, and little
destitute Children, such as seem'd to be left to wander
about in Want and Beggery; and many a poor Boy he has
pick'd up in the Street pretending Charity, andawilling-
ness to do them good, which when it has come to the
Issue,hasbeennomoreorless than to breed them up to
Thieving, and ripen them for the Devil.
But which is still worse than all the rest, I have several
Stories by me at this Time, which I have particular Rea-
sons to believe are true, of Children thus strolling about
the Streets in Misery and Poverty, whom he has taken in
on pretence of providing for them, and employing them;
and all has ended in this (viz.) making Rogues of them.
Horrid Wickedness! his Charity has been to breed them
up to be Thieves, and slill more horrid'! several of these
his own jorsler Children, he has himself caused afterwards
Life and Actions
to be apprehended and Hang'd for the very Crimes
which he first taught them how to Commit.
I am not indeed to make a jest of these things, there is
something shocking and dismal in the very Relation, and
therefore it is, that this Account of the Life of Jonathan
Wild, which in its Nature, is all a Tragedy, is not related
with an air of Banter and Ridicule as Others are; 'tis hop-
ed it will not be the less acceptable to Men of Sense; it is a
solemn and terrible thing to look back on a Life of such
harden'd, abominable Practices; to see it carried on in de-
fiance, either of God or Devil; and that with such Success
too, passing for so many Years unpunish'd; and tho*
there are some things in the long Series of his wickedLife,
which may relish with the Levity of a drol-way of Writ-
ing ; yet to see a Man turn'd into an incarnate Devil, his
Life a Sceneof inimitable Crimes; his very Society a Hell,
andequally devouring both to Soul and Body; he that can
read it without some Horror, must have very little of what
we call Christianity about him.
To see him take up an unthinking Youth in the Street
cover'd with Dirt and Rags, and willing on any Terms to
get out of his Misery; to see this superlative Wretch pre-
tend Charity to the Child, and tell him he will provide for
him, and thereby engage the Lad to him, as to a Gentle-
man thatintends to do him good; and then instead of pro-
viding for him, lead him by the Hand to Hell gates, and
after that, like a true Devil, thrust him in! First to tempt,
and then accuse, which is the very nature of the Devil;
firsttomake poor desolate vagabond Boys, Thieves, and
then betray them to the Gallows! Who can think of such
a thing without a just Abhorrence, who can think it to be
any less than the worst sort of Murther; such was the Life
and such the Practice of this wretched Man, and in these
very last Scenes of his Life, he grew so audacious, that it
seem'd as if he was really ripening up a pace for his own
Destruction.
It is said of him in the Case of that harden'd Felow
Blueskin, that he should say, Jonathan first made him a
Thief, and then abandoning him, left him to carry it on
by himself; and it being necessary to his (Jonathan's)
Fame to have always some Chase in his view, to build his
own Merit upon, with the Government; he kept a Watch
upon him, that he might at last bring him to the Gallows,
for which the said Blueskin was very near giving him a
pass into another World, by that desperate Attempt to
cut his Throat in the face of a Court of Justice; which
Jonathan tho' surpriz'd at then, has had leisure since to
wish, had been effectually done at that time, and said so
publickly in the Press-Yard, two days before his Tryal.
But to come then to the particular Fact for which he
Suffer'd, the Story asit was relatedupon Oath athis Tryal,
and the several Circumstances belonging to it stands thus,
Katherine Stetham deposed: That on the 2 2d, of Janu-
ary, between Three and Four in the Afternoon a Man
and Woman came into her Shop, under Pretence of buy-
ing some Lace: They were said she so very difficult, that
I had none below that would please them; and so, leav-
ing my Daughter in the Shop, I stepped up Stairs, and
brought down another Box. We could not agree abDut
the Price, and so they went away together; and in about
half an Hour after I miss'd a Tin Box of Lace, that I
valu'd at 50/. The same Night, and the next, I went to
Jonathan PFilde's House; but not meeting with him, I
advertised the Lace that I had lost, with a Reward of
i5 Guineas, and no Questions ask'd. But hearingnothing
of it, I wentto Jonathan's House again,and then met with
him: He desir'd me to give him a Description of the Per-
sons that I suspected, which I did as near as I could; and
then he told me that he'd make Enquiry, and bade me
call again in two or three days. I did so; and then he said,
that he had heard something of my Lace, and expected
to know more of the Matter in a little time. I came to him
againonthatday thathe was apprehended, (I think 'twas
the i5thofF<?£r##r)\)Itoldhim,thattho' I hadadvertised
but i5 Guineas Reward, yet I'd give 20 or 25 rather than
not have my Goods. Don't be in such a Hurry, says he, /
don't know but I may help you to it for less; and if Ican, I will.
The Persons that have it, are gone out of Town, I shall set
them to quarrelling about it, and then I shall get it the cheaper.
On the i oth of March, he sent me word, that if I would
come to him in Newgate, and bring i0 Guineas in my
Pocket, he could help me to the Lace. I went: He desired
me to call a Porter; but I not knowing where to find one,
he sent a Person who brought one that appeared to be a
Ticket-Porter. The Prisoner gave me a Letter, which he
said was sent him as a Direction where to go for the Lace;
but I could not read, and so I deliver'd it to the Porter.
Then he desired me to give the Porter the i o Guineas, or
else (he said) the Persons that had the Lace would not de-
liver it. I gave the Porter the Money; he went away, and
in a little time return'd, and brought me a Box that was
seal'd up, but not the same that was lost. I open'd it, and
found all my Lace but one Piece. Now, Mr. Wilde, (says
I) What musl you have for your Trouble? Not a farthing,
(says he) not a Farthing for me. I don't do these things for
worldly In teresl, but only for the Good of poor People that
have met with Misfortunes. As for the Piece of Lace that is
missing, I hope to getitforyou e'er long; and I don't know but
that I may help you not only to your Money again, but to the
Thief too; and if Ican, much good may'tdoyou. And as you're
a good Woman and a Widow, and a Chrislian, I desire no-
thing of you but your Prayers, andfor them I shall be thank-
ful. I have a great many Enemies, and God knows what may
be the Consequence of this Imprisonment.
This is a black Story indeed, and it was very remark-
able, that the Fact was really committed, that is to say,
the Felony was contracted, or that Part which the late
Act in particular reach'd, (viz.) the delivering the Goods,
and taking the Money for discovering them; all this Part
was acted I say after his being committed to Newgate.
It was likewise very remarkable, that there was anoth-
er Case much of the same Nature,which lay ready to have
been brought to a Hearing if this had not intervened,
namely; of a Pocket-Book stolen from Mr. Tidman a
Corn Chandler, in Giltspur slreet, near Newgate, in which
was a Bank Bill for ii61. in which the Witnesses were
two Persons who had pleaded to their Pardons.
We come now to his Behaviour after his Condemna-
tion, and at the Place of Execution, at which last Place he
indeed scarce said a Word to God or Man, being either
doz'd with the liquid Laudanum which he had taken, or
demented and confus'd by the horror of what was before
him, and the reflection of what was within him.
Nor even before he took the Dose of Laudanum was
he in any suitable manner sensible of his Condition, or
concern'd about it, very little sign appear'd of his having
the least Hope concerning his future State; but as he
liv'd harden'd, he seem'd to die stupid.
He declin'd coming to the Chapel, either to the Ser-
mon or Prayers, pleading his lameness by the Gout, but
chiefly the Crowds and Disorders of the People discom-
posing or disordering him. In the condemn'd Hold, or
Place where Malefactors are kept after their Sentence,
they had Prayers as usual, and he seem'd to join with
them in a kind of Form, but little or nothingof the Peni-
tence of a Criminal, in view of Death, appear'd upon
him.
His principal Enquiries seem'd to be about what kind
of State was to be expected after Death, and how the in-
visible World was to be discrib'd; but nothingof the most
certain Judgmentwhichisthere to be expected, righteous
and terrible, according to the Deeds done in the Body, or
of a Saviour to whom to have recourse, as the Slayer in the
old Law had to the City of Refuge to save him from the
avenger of Blood.
As his Time shortn'd he seem'd more and more con-
fus'd, and then began to entertain Discourses of theLaw-
fulnessof dismissing ourselves out of the present Misery,
after the Example of the antient Romans, which as he said
was then esteem'd as an act of Bravery and Gallantry, and
recorded to their Honour.
This kind of Discourse was indeed sufficient to have
caused the Keepers to have had an Eye to him, so as to
prevent any Violence he might offer to himself, and they
did watch him as narrowly as they could; however he so
far deceived them, as that the Day before his Execution
he found means to have a small Bottle with liquid Lau-
danum convey'd to him unseen, of which he took so large
a Quantity, that it was soon perceiv'd by the Change it
made upon him, for he was so drousie that he could not
hold up his Head, or keep open his Eyes, at the time of
reading the Prayers.
Upon this two of his Fellow Prisoners endeavour'd to
rouse him (not suspecting that he had taken enough to
hurt him) and taking him by the Hands, they perswaded
him to stand up, and walk a little about the Room, which
he could not do without help because of his Gout.
Th1s walking, tho' it did a little waken him, had several
other Operations at the same time; for first it chang'd his
Countenance, turning it to be exceeding pale, then it put
him into a violent Sweat, which made them apprehend he
would faint, upon which they offered to give him some-
thing to keep up his Spirits, but he refus'dit,tellingthem
he was very sick; soon after which he vomited very vio-
lently, and this in all probability prolong'd his Life for
the Execution; for by their stirring him, and making him
vomit, he brought up the greatest Part of the Laudanum
which he had taken, before it had been long enough in his
Stomach to mix with the animal Spirits or Blood, which if
it had done but one Hour more, he would certainly have
taken his last sleep in the Prison.
But Nature having thus discharg'd itself of the load,
he reviv'd again, and tho' still doz'd and insensible of
what he said or did, yet he was able to walk about, speak,
and act sufficiently for the Part that remain'd to him,
namely, for the last scene of his Life at the Gallows.
Accord1ngly on Mondaythe 24th of May, he was con-
vey'd in a Cart to Tyburn, and tho' it was apparent he was
stillunderthe Operationof theLaudanum,a.nd that which
was left in his Stomach had so far seiz'd upon his Spirits
as to make him almost stupid, yet it began to go off, and
Nature getting the Mastery of it, he began to be more
sensible of what he was going about; but the Scene was
then short, and he had little to do but to stand up in the
Cart, and, the needful Apparatus being made, be turn'd
off with the rest, which was done about 3 a-Clock in the
Afternooon.
The rudeness of the Mob to him, both at his first go-
ing into the Cart, and all the way from thence to the Place
of Execution, is not to be express'd, and shews how no-
torious his Life had been, and what Impression his known
Villanies had made on the Minds of the People; for, con-
trary to the general Behaviour of the Street in such Cases,
instead of compassionate Expressions,and a general Cast
of Pity which ordinarily sits on the Countenances of the
People, when they see the miserable Objects of Justice
go to their Execution; here was nothing to be heard but
Cursings and Execrations; abhorring the Crimes and the
very Name of the Man, throwing Stones and Dirt at him
all the way, and even at the Place of Execution; the other
Malefactors beingallreadyto be turn'd off, but the Hang-
man giving him leave to take his own Time, and he con-
tinuing setting down in the Cart,the Mob impatient, and
fearing a Reprieve, tho' they had no occasion for it, call'd
furiously upon the Hangman to dispatch him, and at last
threatened to tear him to pieces, if he did not tye him up
immediately.
In short there was a kind of an universal Rage against
him, which nothing but his Death could satisfie or put an
end to, and if a Reprieve had come, it would have, twas
thought, been difficult for the Officers to have brought
him back again without his receiving some Mischief, if
not his Deaths Wound from the Rabble.
So detestable had he made himself by his notorious
Crimes, and to such a height were his wicked Practices
come.
Thus ended the Tragedy,and thus was a Life of horrid
and inimitable Wickedness finish'd at the Gallows, the
very same Place where, according to some, above i20
miserable Creatures had been hang'd, whose Blood in
great measure may be said to lye at his Door, either in
their being first brought into the thieving Trade, or led
on in it by his Encouragement and Assistance; and many'
of them at lasT: betray'd and brought to Justice by his ^2-
Means; upon which worstsortof Murtherhevaluedhim-
self, and would have had it pass'd for ^Merit, even with
the Government itself. ^
