twenty five lines across it, and several smaller
intermediate onesy to represettt Crusoe's calm*
. dar of time.
MUSIC AS CURTAIN RISES.
Crusoe discovered seated R. JET. of fire reading.
Morning dawns—how invigorating are its
Breezes after refreshing sleep—the mind thusi
strengthened by peace, and serenity is fitted
for the labors of the coming day.--And now
my favorite inmates—thou solace, and guardian
Qf ray cell, let me caress you. (Takes eat on*
hitetandnotice*dog.) How tWikfutshotil4&
B
i fee! for all these comforts, music. (Com^
forward out of cave into the enclosure and views
the post or calendar.) And yet as I view this
memorial of time, music; (Scores a line on
post with knife.) As I record another day,
busy reflection whispers what a lengthened
period has elapsed since shipwreck cast me on
this uninhabited spot—twenty five years! more^
than twenty five, yet its retrospect appears but
&s yesterday; ere that time again revolves, I
shall be uumbered with the silent dead, and
not a friend to sympathise with my sufferings,
not a human voice to greet my ear withjtsglad
&Ound.
Parrot during this descends from opening JL. JET.
to railing H. H. unperceived by Crusoe; and
calls.
Parrot. *' Robinson—Robinson Crusoe."
MUSIC*
Crusoe. (Betrays alarm.) Ah! how cap-
ricious are mortals, what we repine at as
wantitig, when it arrives oft appals our senses
*~-whence could this voice arise? must I ever
bewail my hapless lot—alas! poor
Parrot. Poor Robinson Crusoe.
MUSIC,
Crusoe. Oh! 'tis an echo, yet F never before
perceived it, but that is easily accounted for;
now I have Afore time for observation, than
tvhen my cotaforts were so few, as to occasion
incessant toil for daily bread; yet why should
I repine? many in populous cities, are the
houseless wretches who would envy my lot.—*
I&onarcfr as I am; of an Island, where n&
dissensions reign, no factions exist—ray luxuries
are abundant, my wants few, and glorious i$
the thought, I perhaps am the only truly
independent man existing, as every thing I have
occasion for, I am indebted solely to my own
industry—thus favored by Heaven, thus rich!
how can I be disconsolate? or how darpto call
myself, poor Robinson —-*
Parrot. Poor Robin.
MUSIC.
Crusoe. (Examines carefully, at last sees
Parrot on ratling at R. H. Ah! my favored
bird, was it your sprightly chatter, which
occasioned all my fears? thou art my only
speaking' friend, for t must not forget my other
subjects-—you my Prime Minister, for with you
are held my only conversations, and strange to
say, unlike most great men who have a favorite,
from you I hear the voice of truth.
$fusic. Places the ladder against railing9,
ascends, takes Parrot on his hand, turns and
sits on round of ladder, birdjlutters fy chatters.
Come my sweet bird! let me receive your
morning salutations at my levee—r-njore honest
probably than other courtiers; and in return
for kissing thus my hand, I will present you
with substantial cheer.'

which holds him on his finger, till Bird flies
off, Crusoe then comes down ladder, enters,

accoutres himself, pitts on cap, extinguishes
lamp.

Now then lor my daily survey, to view uiy
dominions, my flocks, my herds, my vineyards*
corn grounds, and that monument of my folly,
that useless canoe—fit emblem of ambition,
^hich leads us to attempt things far ^eyond
our power, and after much toil abandons us to
despair, because we cannot possess, what if
attained, would only plunge us into deeper
misery. Shall 1 ever see thee again much
favored Britain? alas! 1 fear not! my soul
sinks within me at the thought.~r-Tho' during
euch absepce all ti^s are doubtless gone—yet
those of allegiance still remain, which I trust
'will never forsake ^n Englishman's breast! my
long residence here may be attended with gooc|

heart expands! years seem but minutes, for I,

Enter Ben L. H.
Hillo! ye ho! Hijlol ye ho! zounds Fye

out signals of distress, when he finds his owii
rum cask broached^-you croak so like Jack
Frog under hatches.
Ben. Well I might croak, for the prospect
of being left on this desolate spot was'nt very
enlivening,
Atkins. Enlivening! no Ben, but yon
peed'nt look as chop fallen as the figure head
of the JLamentations—rtho'f to be sure outf
Chaplain says never keep a look out for sorrow
With the punch ladle ready, but wait till the
can is handed ye, that's time enough to swig.
JEfc&.'''That may be all very true, but—
Atkins. Why I'm not o%er fond of preaching,
tho' somehow dy'e see, I thinks old Barnacle's
yight, however iny boy I'm glad we've met
again^What dy'e think of this here place? 1
have often had a wish to cruise on it before *
but now I'd as leive be off again, for the devil
a soul's to be seen, nor any thing else but a
Ijfew sour oranges, and such like as I nevep
tasted since I went on shore for the scurvy
there at Portobello.
. Bm. Ay, I remember, that was a devilish
4orry bout; but have you seen the Captain, Will.
Afkins. Not I! he's none o' my kidney!
he's to© sanctified, and parleyvooing by half,
too much of the loblolly boy for me—I dard
toy, he's cruising alone, without convoy, in
some of thefee melancholic woods.
Ben. He seems a good man, Atkins, tho*
*ery shy. *
Atkins. Lord help you, seems! why so he
$>e,—Mayhap he's likely to suit such a land
lubber as you; but an old sailor don't like such
queer chaps, as never has # damme to throw
?tt one good, .or bad, but goes moping and
moping about, looking as glum as a Lascar irk
quarantine—no, no Ben J we likes our com-
manders all rough and blunt, all fire and tow,
and my eyes our navy boasts many pf them
liettlesorne sparks.
Ben. Ay, but then how quiet we are in our
fchip, Will; no flogging,
Atkins. Shiver my timbers, I'd rather have
flogging than preaching at any time. Why a
round dozen of an evening keeps a m$n warm
in his hammock, and a salt eel for breakfast,
gives him an appetite, when his allowance of
rumbo's served out. I'd sooner <at any time
hear our Boatswain pipe all hands to the grat-
ing, than be tumbled up to old SplicemV
sarmon.
Ben. That's not my mind however.
Atkins. Well never let difference of opinion
jio more nor of religion, breed ill blood among
messmates; but our Captain heaves in sight—•
1 say, Ben, what think ye of leaving hi$
thoughtful honor behind here, it might mend
his studies, and be as well for the crew.
Ben. Not for the world—
At/tins. Avast ye s\ya^! would you betray
us?
Ben. You know but little of an English
sailor's heart then, after all your years at se$;;
if you th|nk he'll ever listen coolly to a mutiny
against his Commander.
Atkins Yoft a sailor! you be why
you are not fit to be Cook's,mate to the Marines
-—you are no sailor, if you peach against a
messmate, tho' you may not like the plot, my
eyes you would not be a traitor to the crew,
would you? But if you were, t'would only
inake good the old saying; "the greatest rogue
generally turns out King's evidence."
Ben, No! much as I detest a mutineer, I
despise too highly the character of an informer,
ever io disgrace the blue jacket I wear, by
becoming one:
Atkins. Why that's all right and hearty,
and as it should be—but mum I say, here he
is.
(Retire up stage.)
Enter Captain Bowling L. U.
Captain. My thoughts have led me further
than I intended, however I am not likely to
have my privacy disturbed by the insipid salu-
tations of what the world terms friends, (sees
sailors) Hah! two of my crew! and one of
them Atkins—that man I have much suspicion
of.—Hollo there! Go, get the boat ready, I will
follow quickly; the tide by this time must:
serv£.
Exeunt Ben and Atkins L. H.
The natural beauties of this Island would
almost reconcile me to an absence from
Albion's happy shores, did I not flatter myself,
that on my return thither I should be blest
with my Mary's hand; yet it will be long I fear,
ft're I re-visit that wished for Country.
When torn by duty from the view,
©f Albion's shores—my soul confest, v
Ho other ties but love and thee—Mary f
Thro- distant climbs my vessel true,
Bears this sad heart-^yet still no rest
ts mine, till I again behold—Mary.
Whilst folding: thee within these arms8,
I whispered, "I'll tfo transports seek,"
<" No other ties but love and thee—M ary V*
The blush which heightened all thy charmV
The tear which beaded thy soft cheek,
All, all, proclaimed thee mine—Mary!
fly swift ye hours witb circling Wing,
Speed toe Oht gafe of prosperous sortr
To ties alone of love and thee—Mary,
May wealth attained with honor bring

Ne'er more to part from thee—Mary*

Oh! solitude! however pleasing at times to
the contemplative mind, like every earthly
gratification thou become'st palling from satiety;
yet I wish not for a numerous society, had I
but a single cofttpamo^ to cheer the gloom
which now surrounds me, to communicate
my ideas to, and lighten the burthen as life
decline^ I should be too blessed; but ah! it
cannot be expected; here alas! I am immured*

Is it a vision, a reprimand for my murmuring

music. Examines foot mark,
Oh, lio! too sure it is not the creation of busy
fancy; or an ideal form presented to my heated
imagination; but the real, the terrifying truth,
which flashes conviction to my staggerred
senses, and brings destruction on my wretched
head—ee'n now I see myself within their grasp;
ee'n now I feel myself a prey to the bloody
fangs of savage nature; ee'n now I hear their
discordant yells upon my startled ears.

Crusoe puts his foot on hatchet, and presents

Crusoe renders, and waves his hand to Indian
to lay down his arms, then goes to Friday to
assure him of his protection. The Indian
watches this opportunity of placing an arrow
in his bow, and is on the point of discharging
it at Crusoe, who apprised oj Ms danger by
the cry of Friday, turns quickly round, and
shoots Indian Friday seeing this expresses
great astonishment at report of gun, and its
effects, when his fear subsides, requests leave
to view the body of Indian, which is granted.
Friday titms the body about, after inspecting

at Crusoe's feet; and in token of submissive
gratitude, throws himself prostrate* and

Friday. Me tank you ever and ever, more
long my life.
Crusoe. No thanks! 1 only did my duty,
in relieving you, a fellow creature in distress,
and punishing such treacherous ingratitude!
(Points to the body which Friday is looking at)
Friday, for such I shall call you, in remem-
brance, of this day; and you must call me
master,.
Friday. Res! ees! me call you massaj

laeed tooth food and repose, after the fatigue,
and dangers, you have undergone.
Friday. Repose massa! watdat?
Crusoe. Sleep, that soothing balm which
heaven sends in kindnesjs to our woes; where
they are all hushed to rest—where tyrannic
rule no longer reaches, where servitude itself
is happy, 4 l
Friday. Oh! me like sleep much, but me
like much better talk wid you, ray great good

see you top much.
Crusoe. 0h! gratitude how pleasing are
thy accents to the ear, fo* benefits conferred,
hear this poor black, pour forth such sentiments
as would well become the fairest bosom, and then
blush that ye should think, because his skin is
tinctured by the sun beams of a more: tropical
climate, that Heaven ever designed him as the
slave to his brother man. i\qw will 1 shew

our Great Benamuekee; as me did in the
canoe just pow, so he hear poor black man's
prayers, senf) you to help me, and make my
heart dance wid joy when me see you my

Crusoe. Well his't thou said Friday, that
great being by whatever name adored, is
ever mindful of his creatures. (Apart) May
I be thankful for my safety, and the boon sent
me by Providence in this faithiul friend; and
Jet my mind reflect with pleasure that 1 have
done an act which reconciles me to the means,
as thereby 1 have saved a brother in distress.

Enter Lieutenant, two Midshipmen and Sailors>
H. jHT.
Lieut. Now my lads, we must return $o
Our watering place, and make signal for a boat,
as e're this the captain must be on board, and
our lagging behind will look like abandoning
our charge—which no English sailor ever
should be thought capable of, no, sooner than
desert his flag, he should fight under its shadow
till he sinks with it nailed to the mast.
Finale to the first Act.

Lieutenant and two Midshipmen.
When Ihe Flag we fight for is unfurled,
It say's unto a wondering world
Each Sailor these id^as does cherish.
He wars not for wealth, or lucre of gold,
But for every blessing his country does hold.
He tights but to conquer or peri&b,
fie rights, &c.
Chorus of Sailors.

Huzza! huzza!! huzza!!!
We fight.but to conquer or perish.

Crusoe, So, you only eat your prisoners,
and tvhy do you so?
Friday. We promise Great Benamuckee
before we go to war, we eat all we take.
Crusoe. Religion! whose precepts should
be mild, and breathe only good will to each
other, how art thou preverted! Thou art made
the pretext for sanguinary war, and more atro-
cious sacrifice—What myriads of victims are
immolated at thy imaginary shrines, whose
worships are offensive to the great author of
all good, (apart) But a truce to these
thoughts, and let me ask you Friday——
Friday. Stop ittle bit massa, me put away

Friday. (Dancesjoyously.) Oh! ees massa,

so glad to see!
Crusoe. Oh! nature, yes my poor fellow, I
envy thfce such feelings. More precious is the
tear which decks thy sable cheek than all the
jewelled treasures of the east.
Friday. There massa you see black and
White mans live togeder broders.
Crusoe. Happy sight! then will be realised
my fondest hope, the hearfelt wish of every
Englishman, universal happiness, and slavery
abolished.
Friday. Friday tellem live good—pray

Friday. Den massa me go, if you go, me
tell dem you kill my enemies, save my life, me

warrior—dey make great dance—great feast—

Crusoe. Heaven forbid! that ambition should
fire me to accept the anxious cares of royalty!
'tis at all time an unthankful office; where
birth has unfortunately imposed the task: but
woeful ever is the usurper's fate, and unpitied
should be his fall. No, as you seem to desire
it, I will furnish you a canoe, go, repair t&
your countrymen, and leave me as I was before
we met.
Music. Friday fetches hatchet tihich is against
paling, and pi esents it to Crusoe.
Friday. Oh! massa! massa pray kill Friday,

Crusoe Why kill you?

Crusoe betrays much alarm.
Crusoe. What dreadful soundt was that?
Ie it the blast of death! surely my servant will

See victory's fire, in flames arise,
To consumimate our sacrifice.
Conk shell march renewed, a superb war canoe

lesser consequence, the first having a frame
with upright ends, on which are carved rude
idolic figures—the principal canoe contains
chief of the tribe, the other, minor chiefs;
savages who were on before, sit round fire,
having previously formed two lines to receive
the chief whilst he lands, his attendant
warriors form semi circle.
22
Chief. Warriors of the nation, an*1 favored
by the great Ouramakakee; after our toils
undergone in war, 'tis (it we seek repose in the
lap of peace, and celebrate our victories with
sacrifice, as a just atonement for our lost
brethren who fell in battle, whose spirits are
departed beyond the hills.
Meschec. Marcy upon me! Marcy upon
me, vy vas ever I tempted upon this voyage of
discovery? to leave my shnug littel shop in
Rosemary Lane?
Chief. Silence— (to savages) Encrease the
fire for our solemn rites, and fix the consecrated
instrument to which we suspend our offerings.
music Savages encrease fire% and place across
it the wooden frame from out the first canoe9
which should be of terrific appearance, with
hooks, tyc. capable of embracing and suspend*

Kolah: No I can die as toell here; and yet
Cowards if at liberty, you shall then see, with
what resolution an Ipdian leader can meet her

Chief unbinds her.
Chief. Tis not for that thy fetters ire
removed, but 'tis to hear the honors that await
thee when my bride —
Kolah. That ^vill never be; what think you
I can so far forget my Nation's Law, my King,
my Country, &nd my God? As to league with
thee our most inveterate enemy: No, sooner
would I suffer death, protracted to the latest
stretch, and heightened by the infliction of the
sharpest torments, 'ere I would pass a life,
preserved by an uijion with the re4 man's foe.
i>4
Chief, These are high sounding terms; #nd
suited to the warriors, not the female breast:
but no\v to put your boasted courage to the*
proof; know I have watched thee, since within
my power, and am convinced, love for another
produces this disdain, not the pure motive thou
woiild'st ascribe it too.—Behold thy fellow
prisoner, that pallid wretch! (points td
Spaniard) whose color I despise, Whose tribe
I would exterminate.
Kolah. What mean you?
Chief. To probe your hearts extremes!
dense by niaking thee spectator of thy minions
death.
Kolah* Minion—I scorn thy words base
leader, but much more bitterly my soul scorns
thee.—Now by the spirit of the waters, do I
swear, that grateful loyalty first prompted my
attentions to that chief—He saved my life, for
which I thank him.—He saved our King for
which I reverence him, and more than once he
proved our country's champion, routing thy
dastard tribes, for which I glory in him. Ha!
well may'st thou rejoice he is in thy power, for
he has long been thy nation's scourge.
Chief, i^ut shall no longer, ere an hour he
dies.
Kolah. Fine proof of courage truly—the
truly brave ever revere the brave; and though
in. the person of an enemy afford valour their
protection, when wars uncertain chance has
placed it in their power.
Chief. What! by such protection to enable
your foe to bear wars horrors again into your
hmd.—I know no sjach folly.
-25
Kolak tf virtue, if humanity, be folly! thou
certaiuly art very wise: for jyell I stee, that thou
jpossessest neither of them.
Chief. Spare these unavailing taunts and
answer plainly; shall this christian be indebted
for his life to thy clemency? or fall deeply
cursing thy obd urate heart, which refuses a boon
so easily attained; »q nobly offered too, and
graced as it will be with my love,
Juan. Sooner lady, would I suffer the
pangs of death a thousand times, e'en from the
J*ands of heretics, than see sentiments like thine
allied to brutality, such as is our foes.
Meschec. Oh! if he voud only shave my
life now, Fd send him a dozen vives,—from
Jtosemary Lane, (apart.)
Chief. <Add not to the disdainful insults of
this proud woman; though in spite of her
scorrt, still do I vow, if she accept my proffered
hand, (which queens have vainly sought) then
will I free thee, and return thee safe unto thy
foster nation, \f not, thou diesA, apd she becomes
conipapion in thy death, for love rejected
generates deepest hate.

thy cruelties,on the defenceless and the weak.
Kolah. Well do such acts become his
tyrant heai;t—yet monster let me owe a boon
to thee—e'en let ipe suffer first.
Chief. No, thou shalt behold thy lover

ing limbs—part of our festive banquet—*-then

Kolah. How pleasing is this view of filial
love, produced by nature It is a plant of

Crusoe I consider it invaluable, from those
it has just preserved, to one of whom apology
is due.—Lady 1 plead in excuse the danger of
our situation, that now happily removed; the
rights of hospitality must atone for recent
neglect.
Kolah. The common intercourse of life,

outer garb to robe the basest purposes; but
ehieftian no excuse should be looked for, the

SCENE IV. A WOOD.
Enter Atkins, Ben, Sally, (disguised as a
sailor boy) vtfith other sailors R. H.
Ben. I say Will it was all aloiig of your
persevering in this wicked scheme, that we are
cut off from ever seeing our friends in old
England again.
Sally. Yes, for if ^ve had'nt come ashore
this time, we never could have lost our boat,
Ben. And if Atkins had'nt started all the
water casks, we shoud'nt have been obliged to
come ashore again.
Sally. Ay, and then the Captain inviting all
the passengers to come and visit this beautiful
Island as he calls it; occasioned this mischief.
Atkins. You are right boy; the devil
certainly stood my friend there; but however
stow all your lubberly patter, 1 own I'm wrong,
but who'd have thought of meeting any of
these black sharks here? why all the years, f
have been in these here latitudes, the Island
&2
jras always been thought uninhabited: or Tm
sure I'd never have named leaving his melan*
cholic worship on it to refit.
Sally. For shame Will, how could you be
so barbarous, to intend going away Without
our Commander?
Ben. Ay, ay, you see treachery ds always
puni»hed-r-l told you bow t'would be,
Sally. (Crying) Yes we «h-all never get
away any more.
Atkins. Have done with your snivelling
boy! what's the use of it? and all this palaver
—here we are land locked sure enough; at
least 'till we can rig out something like a boat,
to carry us over to the main, but that will he a
plaguy long time first, seeing as how we have
no tools o^ any kind.
Ben. And yet you did not mind exposing
the Captain to all these hardships!
Atkins. Why look ye Ben, I'm no spokes-
man, but if so be as you must know my reason
for this, I'll tell you—.1 hates this Captain as
much as 1 do a Mounseer, or an Algerine, not
for his manners belike, so much as for scudding
away with my sweetheart just before I went
abroad.
Ben. Well, its a way with us sailors, to
bear off any girl that seems willing.
Atkins. Yes, but not a messmates—that's
not quite ship shape I thinks,
Ben. But how do you know he was guilty
of this?
Atkins. Why you &ee, just after he left our
'Port to take this command, Sail hove out of
sight, and has never been heard of more.
So its thought she foundered; and as they
sailed in company like, it could be no one but
him—-so shiver me if ever I forgive him, as long
as I can strike twelve bells.
lien. But now since fate has thrdwn us all
into the same den, I trust you'll think no more
about this supposed fault, but try to make
amends for the dreadful situation you have
brought him into.
Atkins. Why Ben, you never loved, or you
could not speak so softly about your rival;
after he had robbed you of the only girl you
had a mind to be spliced too: a rascally pirate
to pretend so much, and then hang out false
signals to decoy her away.
Ben. But as you never saw them together,
you have no right to think it was him that
did so,
Atkins. Why douce my glims, its plaguy
odd T never thought of that afore, I wonder
where my head rail was all this time! Splinter
my hull if I ev?r thought I was a scollard—
but its not much to be wondered at; consider-
ing there were no Sunday Schools, nor Bible
Societies when I was a boy. Howsomeever
my main top gets more cranky than ever, so
lets drop that, and see whats to be done in this
here mess, now these black devils have
destroyed our boat.
Sally during preceeding dialogue expresses
great pleasure at Atkins constancy.
Sally* Perhaps, they'll send another from
the ship, to search for us?
Atkins. They send! Tf we rieVer haul off
this -quicksand,'til! they fling out a rope, we
ghall be aground all our lives—no they'll be
too glad to ^et rid of us, for there'll he famous
pickings, now alf the passengers are ashore too.
Besides they'll think our briafs swamped; at
least, they'll clap it down so in the log book,
and sail without us.
Ben. Well then we must put odr shoulder
to the wheel, and look out for a cabin, as
night's coming on.
Atkins, Tbats true; so hoist sail fads, and
lets see what's to be done in this precious
affair—f almost repents of having begun it, but
avast at preaching; that will neither find usiii
grog, biscuit, or hammock.
lien. What no faith in providence I don't
you remember what our Chaplain said last
Sunday?
Atkins. \7o, not I.
Ben. Why this he said Will—" In the hour
of danger; a man who relies apon his mercy,
will ever find it his sheet anchor."
Atkins* Tip us your fin Ben. Lets stand
by each other now, so heave a head my boys;
you Ben take the helm, lets keep a good look
out; and mind, if we fall in with any of these
black muzzles, we must fight or die.
ftueunt all but Sally L H.
Sally. What mischief we women make in
this world. So jealousy about me, has brought
my dear William into this sad dilemma—why
did I ever leave my father's house, to follow
Iiim in disguise? Why jealousy made me do it;
but this shocking affair, has convinced me of
85
his truth, and now I'd rather never see my
home again than be separated from him—but
perhaps 1 may lose him now, and William
never know that his own dear Sail, has beea
so long his shipmate.
&ottg>
To try my William's faith, I went on board his ship,
Disguised like to a sailor lad, dy'e see;
I laughed, joked, sung, danced, and drank my flip,
And learn't each boyish action to a T.
So well I've borne my honors, he does not me suspect,
Lord bless you! why how should he dy'e see;
To preserve him from all danger,.I gladly would be wrecked,
As he's constant, why its every thing to me,
"So I can sing" Yeo ho, fol, de riddle ho!
Like a merry little sailor lad, dy'e see.
One day as in the tops, my William's foot did slip,
Then I felt not like a sailor lad, dy'e see;
I could neither sing, joke, dance, or drink my flip,
But lost each boyish action, -\h! poor me;
My woman's fears were raised by this unlucky fall,
As 1 saw him headlong pitch o'erboard like a log;
Sly senses fled away, and I fainted with a squall,
From which he quickly raised me, by a drop of grog.
u When I saw him safe I began to sing"
Yeo ho, fol, de riddle ho!
"And danctd1 like a merry little sailor lad, dy'e see.
Now his love is so assured—I am grieved he went so far,
As to bring us to this barren spot dy'e *ee;
Yet if the Captains safe, I then may wed my tar,
My William who is every thing to me;
But should they punish him for what is done amiss,
Perhaps doom him to a loss of life dye see;
I should curse my jealous fears, that brought him into this,
£y following, as a sailor lad to sea.

Oh dear! oh dear! oh dear! I wish I was back
again at Dunghill Farm, why did levergetten
into my precious stupid yead, to run away
from it, to list into the Royal Marines, and go
a woyaging to see the world? 1 shall never see
any more on't, that's for sartin, no, no, here I
be's snug enough, shut up like Jack in a Box,
pratty piece o' business Iv'e made on't by list-
ing for the Ingies—sarjant tuold 1, I ware to
mak tny fortin, and come home a general but a'ter
all he told 1 about generals, gold, and fine
sights, Is'e find I have been gammoned, into
being only a private in the Royal Marines, and
stuck on board a ship, to see nothing but sky
and water, talk to me of sights and shews, a
pratty Lord Mayors show Iv'e made on't oh
dear! oh dear! oh dear!
Pacing stage,
Enter Captain Bowling R. Hm
Captain. For shame man! cease this cry-
ing, what c^nnpt be avoided must be borne.
Simon, lie's, ee's, Coptain, that's all nation
fine to be sure—but I can't bear it, oh dear!
oh dear! oh dear!
Captain. You a man sir! a soldier too!
Simon. Ee's sur that J bees a Royal Marine I
but sarjant says I beant much of a sogur.
Captain. How mean you?
Simon. Why I'll tell you sir from first
to last, to say nothing about general, as sarjant
promised to make I, when I listed into Royal
Marines, 1 finds 1 shall never be a Corporal,
37
for tho' sarjant gives I a mort of stripes on my
back, I can't get even one upon my arm.
Captain. Indeed! I am afraid you have
been inattentive to his instructions.
Simon. A nan, sir.
Captain. I mean you have not been regular
at drill.
Simon. Lord blesse'e sur, one or to'ther of
urn, have been drilling 1 most all day long,
ever since I listed, iiut they says I never gets
on, for somehow its so carnation puzzling to
learn this exercise of the Royal Marines.
Captain. Indeed! well I was not aware of
the difficulty of military tactics.
Simon Oh! ee*s sur! their antics be very
difficult—do you know they wants 1 to do
more than one thing at a time, and I can't for
my life, then theres our lieftenant, our sarjant,
our corporal, aye, and our little drummer too,
all making a noise together, and as they teached
1 at rational school, "no man can serve two
masters."
Captain. National school, you mean Simon.
Simon. What it beant rational then?
Captain. I did not say that; far be it from
me, to decry the utility of those noble institu-
tions. But lets hear something further of your
marine education.
. Simon. Royal marine, if you please sur.
Captain. Certainly! I never wish to dero-
gate from a title so well deserved, by the
eminent services of that highly useful corps,
and truly happy am I to think their resplendent
merit, has attracted notice, and gained them
such a dignified mark of favour, 1 beg pardon
Simon, neither myself or country should ever
forget the Royal marines.
Simon. Thankee sur, ,oor I, I'm sure they
always runs in my y^ad, but as I mentioned
yead sur, when sarjant teaches I to hold it up,
if he'd only nay that, ih^rd bless'ee I o^ould do it
•—but then dang it he cries \4 tention, eyes right
and eyes left/' so that Im bothered, and yvhen
Is'e marching, what wi his "left, right, left, right"
I doesn't Jkuow one leg from the t'other, then
he "halts and dresses," I both at onetime, tilII
am as unhappy as I was when your honour came.
Captain. Well, well, no more just now
Simon
Simon. Thank'ee, zooks I wish drill was
always so short.
Captain. We must now forget the past, and
think what's to be done in our present situation.
Simon What more to be larn't yet in the
royal marines? 1 thought you told J, sur just
now, drill was over.
Captain, (apart) My fate is much embit-
tered by the situation of our female passengers
—where have you left the ladies? 1 ordered
yon to remain with them.
Simon. So I did sur, till the old lady, and
her young woman went into the wood in search
of ventures, as she called it, to see the world, \
suppose sur she meant—and thep tother
sur, that nice lady, 1 mean thiUfpreign one sur.
Captain. A h \ the Spanish Donna, I brought
from Calcutta, where she had been in search
of her husband, who was shipwrecked.
Simon. Ee's, sur, that halt widow Jike, she
was so tired, sur, she sat down and iallsd last
39
to sleep—so then 1 corned away, for yon know
it wan't proper for I to stay alone, wi another
man's wife when she ware sleeping.
Captain, Well if that's the case, we must
re-trace our steps, lest some untoward accident
should occur to heighten misfortunes already
too heavy. IT my crew, had only deserted me,
I should have been less afflicted, but to see
those confided to ones care, and especially
women, whom we are all hound to protect,
suffer on my account is intolerable. Come
Simon follow.
Exit Captain R> H.
Simon. Follow! now if our sarjant had
been commanding officer, he'd have said

At Dunghill Farm I first saw light,
Simort Voddy were I christened;
And thof not counted vary bright,
My parents eyes they glistened;
To make a farmer long they tried,
My heart it were much daunted;
But legs, "other fish were to be fried,"
The world to see I wanted:
Wi its ups and downs, its smiles and frowns, aria* aH
Its queer vagaries ;—4ts stars and ribbons iron
Crowns, got, and lost by "March to Paris."
A sarjant com'd to our town fair,
And told many a pratty tale;
At his drum and fife I did so stare,
He laughed, swore, and drank my alej
Says he "but come and list wi me,
"There's a guinea gold in hand;
"A general you quick will be,

Till I'm quite a tired of drill:

Jenny attending.
Jenny. Dear mi'aa, don't take on so, tho9
We have not s&en any one yet—1 dare's to say
we shall.
Miss P. Oh! no Jenny, this is a much
worse place than even the East Indies.
Jenny. Dear ma'am, I thought you said
that was unpossible? I wonder you can men-
tion that horrid place again ifta'am, after all
your love affairs failed there.
Miss P. True Jenny—but if I had staid a
little longer; a person of my appearance could
not have been overlooked—I do still think
there might have been a chance of my marrying
some rich nabob, but here
Jenny. The chance ma'am, is just as good
I think.
Miss P. You think! how can you be so
silly as to think any such thing? where there
&on't seem to be One inhabitant, no I was
^rong to leave the Indies, tho' I grant the
chance was rather lessened to what I remember
it fifty years ago, then every lady of my ac-
quaintance who went out to India married
splendidly.
Jenny. Perhaps ma^am if you had gone fifty
years ago, you'd have met with better luck.
Miss P. Fifty years ago! indeed! did I say
Jifty years? Oh! it is a mistake of mine Jenny
—1 can't recollect half that time.
Jenny. Oh no to be sure ma'am, that was
before yod was born.
Miss P. You are perfectly right Tenny.
Jenny. But I suppose you can remember
ma'am, what all your relations told you before
we left England?
Miss P. Yes, I recollect they wished me to
mope out my days at home—but says J, do you
think Miss Arabella Puff, with all her accom-
plishments, has not a soul above your grovelling
ideas? so J'll go in search of adventures, for
I'm determined to be a bride to none but some
great man, and tho' unsuccessful in Calcutta,
from their want of discernment, who knows
Jenny, even now, but we are left ob this Island
for that purpose—so mind when I marry, I'll
promote you to be my maid of honor.
Jenny, (aside) Maid of honor indeed! I'd
rather be any body's wife, than maid of honor
to a queen.
Miss P, Whats that you are muttering
about.
Jenny* I was only wishing you to be ^
queen.
G
Miss P. Thank ye Jenny, when that event
takes place, I shall certainly prefer you depend
tip6n it.
Jenny. Perhaps my master may too—such
things they say happen at court.
Friday behind L. H. calls " massa Meschec."
Miss P. (rises) Bless me Jenny, was not
that a mans voice? Oh! dear I am quite?
alarmed, quite terrified, quite shocked too—to
be seen in such an undress—oh dear it is very
provoking.
Jenny, (alarmed) Oh! I declare ma'am,
if it isn't a wild negur man j and is coming this
way—Oh La mercy! where shall I go? oh! I
Wish we had atiy body to protect us-^-if it was
only that stupid marine Simqn.
Miss P. I wonder what business he had to
leave us, when the Captain appointed him my
body guard—there's another proof of bad taste,
for I suppose he is gone off with that foreign
woman, Jenny.
Jenny. Yes ma'am, these foreigners be the
very devil, they weigles away all the men.
Friday nearer t€ Why you no come'

nearer.
Miss. P. Mercy on us—who knows what
his intentions may be? how is he drest Jenny f
Jenny. Why ma'am I can't see he is drest
at all.
Miss P. Oh! fie for shame Jenny, what
not drest at all! oh! I shall faint indeed if
thats the case!
Jenny. He seems to have a hatchet in his
hand.
Miss P. A tomahawk! ah! its one of the
savage Indians—I shall be scalped alive.
Jenny. Scalped—you forget ma'am you
wear a wig.
Miss P. How dare you put me in mind of
my misfortunes? yes, since that dreadful fever,
till my head resumes its late luxuriant ringlets
—I own I am obliged to be temporarily in-
debted to art.
Friday sings behind L. H.
"Massa make fine coats, till cold weader comes,
Me go milk de goats, make cheese and gader plums."

head, hatchet in hand, observes women.
Friday. What me see! two chum chums!

(Miss Puffin great agitation.)
Jenny. Oh! dear ma'am be pacified, he
seems very tame, and speaks English too.
Miss P. Does he? I shoud'nt be surprised
if he was some great person in this country.
Jenny. Perhaps a black prince, you know
we had one in England a long time ago.
Miss^ P. Two Jenny—our own black prince
iand prince Lee Boo, this may be a distant
relation to one of them, I think I may venture
to accost him.
Jenny. Yes pray do ma'am.
Miss P. Dread sir, permit a maiden lady
of high birth, who has been induced to visit
this island, to ask wham she has the honour of
addressing?
Friday. My name Friday, what yours?1
Miss P. Miss Arabella Puff, ^youngest
daughter of Mr. Deputy Puff, of Candlewick-
ward, London,
, Friday. Who dat? your picaninni? (point-
ing to Jenny)
Miss P. Oh! dear I shall faint! Jenny
what can the brute mean to insinuate, when I
told him I was a maiden lady.
Jenny. He must have forgot that ma'am.
Miss P. Well then I think I shall forgive
him.
Friday. How long you come? when you
go away?
Jenny. He seems very particular in h\&
enquiries ma'am,
Miss P. Don't he Jenny! why sir, as you
seem so desirous of knowing; 1 only arrived
to day, but our stay is very uncertain, heigho!
Friday. Heigho! you no well-r-wie do any
ting for you? drink some dis. (°ffeV^J^g-)
Jenny. Oh! he's smitten, I'm sure ma'am*
Miss P. Indeed I think so, oh! dear sir?
you are too good.
Friday, JNo, me no good, my massa be very
good.
Miss P. His master! there Jenny, observe
what your advice has led me into, you seelv'e
been demeaning myself by talking to a black
footman,
Friday. My massa great man, he Icing dis
place.
Jenny. There ma'am didn't I say, we should
meet with something worth having.
Miss P. Ah! but this is no black prince,
after all.
Friday. Me, massa's head man.
Miss P. He must be prime minister Jenny
—pray sir, will you conduct me, to your
master's lady— his wife 1 mean, (apart to Jenny)
now 1 shall hear if his majesty is married.
Friday. He no chum, chum—he white
man's like you, live here all lpne.
Jenny. Here's an adventure ma'am, a white
king! thats better than a black prince at any
time.
Miss P. Jenny, come hither—I mean to
fulfil my promise, and I here appoint you my
maid of honor.
Friday. No white chum chums here.
Jenny Better and better, for as there jare
no white women here:—you have an excellent
chance at last ma'am.
Miss P. Yes Jenny, I think its settled
now: but if I had followed my relations silly
advice, instead of being a queen, I should never
even have been introduced at court.
Enter Meschec L, H. eating a bunch of
dried grapes.

SCENE I.
Crusoe discovered tit table* with Miss Pwff\
Kola It, Jenny, Sf Captain Bowling.— Outside
cave in front JL. H.C. seated on ground, are
Meschec and Simon, regaling.
Round this rural festive board,
In peace we sit—with plenty stored;
Gratitude—our hearts inspire,
Gratitude—should never tire;
But still in cheerful accents raise,
Loud peans to our patron's praise;
Worthy host in whom combine,
Valour and bounty—gifts divine.
Crusoe. Welcome ladies, and you my
worthy friends; after this frugal cheer, 1 trust
we shall feel recruited for approaching labours
—the first of which must be regaining your
vessel from the pirate crew*
Captain. Thanks generous sir, hut that I
apprehend will be a service of ranch hazard,
if atchieved.
Crusoe. Never despair! our enemies are
riot so numerous, for when I seized the boats
(which now lay in readiness to take us on
board) we surprised therein some sleeping
sailors., whom we have secure. Meanwhile I
dispatched my faithful Friday and his father,
to try by the stratagem of halloing; whether
we could not draw the stragglers far into the
woods, where bewildered or fatigued to sleep,
they might fall an easy prey—which plan has
Succeeded to my utmost wish.
Captain Many of the men, I know have
been seduced into this mutiny, and will-readily
come back to their duty, on promise of a pardon.
Crusoe. So I foresaw, and accordingly
empowered my people to assure such of forgive-
ness; and doubt not we shall muster strength
sufficient to perform the task; and reinstate
you speedily in your command.
Captain. I may reckon on your help
Simon?
Stmdn. (rises, a$ does Meschec.y Ee's sir,
that you may, for thof Vse no great sogur]
sarjant says; blessee I does'nt mind fighting a
bit for my officer, aye or any other officer, tho'
he may'nt be in the royal marines.
Meschee. Veil, tho' I'm not very fond of
fighting—1 mean mid guns and swords I
should'nt very much mind trying a round or
two, for a chance of once more seeing Rosemary
JLane.

Kolah. My services, brave Chief you may
command to get you back your own; and for*
our absent champion I dare engage
Crtisoe. True lady! AVe should not forget
that noble Spaniard—but yet I fear we shall
lose his aid; as he is in search of the lady you
mentioned; and if he returns not quickly—
valuable as his assistance would be—we must
dispense with it.
Miss P. I am extremely sorry Oapfain, in
this gefi'eraff offer of service, that I am precluded
being useful, for thotogh my late father, Mr.
Deputy Puff, 6f Candlewick Ward, London,
was a very distinguished Lieutenant Colonel of
Voiunteers(so much so indeed as to halve a silver
soup tureen and la:dle presented him bytike corps
he comrrianded) yet his parental affection, did
not extend to giving me any insight into either
military or n&val manoeuvres. Unlike this noble
lady, I must confess my total ignorance in the
art of war.
Friday, (from top of ladder outside) Oh!
massa, tnassa, here me bring more white mans.

Sailors, and Atkins.
Crusoe. Are you ready to stand or fall
by your Captain; answer yes or no—for little'
time is to be lost.
Sailors. Ay, ay sir, every man of us.
Captain. I must make this exception'
Governor—all shall have pardon but Will
Atkins.
Sally, {aside) Oh! mercy.
si
Atkins. Why Captain what have I done
more than the rest? We were alljin around
robbjn 1 think.
Captain. Thats not true—it was you first
proposed leaving us on shore.—However as
the Governor is an .Englishman—he releases
the rest upon their good behaviour—but yoit
Atkins must prepare for death to-morrow.
Atkins, P.ardon! pardon, Captain.
Crusoe. How earnestly is forgiveness sought
when detection comes, but no thought of
mercy prevents the commission of crime. The
horrid death you exposed these your superiors
to, by deserting them, unprovided with every
necessary, on what you imagined a desolate
Island, raised no compunction in your breast:
You thought nojt of the sufferings you thereby
doomed them tor How dare you then to
hope for grace, or to solicit pardon. I shall
secure this ringleader—Friday bring out those
chains that hang within the inner cave.
Friday exits into cave—Atkins implores mercy,,
Crusoe. No! your crime was unprovoked!
and though mercy ever should attend on justice-
example must extinguish lawless violence.

Crusoe bind Atkins to the rock it. H.
Ben. Well Captain, we will stand by you
to our last; and if any act treacherously now]
let 'em be hanged in chains on the beach.
Forgive me sir, (weeps) though the punishment
is just; I can't see unmoved, a messmate, and
a brave one like Will Atkins in this situation.
52
Captain. Your feelings do you Credit,
but in this instance they must be disre-
garded. So by your future actions let me see
that you obliterate your past misdeeds.
Ben. Captain rely on it, y^e 11 do our duty
—and now messmates what say you to three
cheers on the occasion, "Success to this
expedition, and the British Wavy.
Sailors. Huzza! huzza! huzza!
Crusoe and Captain retire up with ladies.

Atkins. See the Captain heaves in sight.
Board put out by sailors, Captain lands,
comes doivn in centre.
Captan. Where is our worthy host? I sup-
pose his numerous preparations keep him from
us so long—Atkins I am glad to think, that
your late act of bravery has cancelled your
faults, I have learnt the motives \Vhicli instigated
yoii to regard me as your enemy; and it should
impress strongly on our minds the horrors
which may arise from unfounded suspicion—
Let this be a warning to you, how you indulge
in future, that baneful passion jealousy—For
though you have now escaped its dread effects,
yet both being tinctured with it, f cannot too
strenuously urge your repressing its growth.
Enter Friday, R. II with Crusoe's skin cap,
umbrella, large bag of money, and parrot in

MUSIC.
Crusoe. My esteemed friends, s*t length the
painful task <?f separation is to be performed
J*
—let me ott'c'e more survey this scene of many
pleasures, many woes: these my dependants,
objects of my care, (approaching goats, who
from a browsing position ri$e and come to paling
Jor him to ccvress them.) to see them now affects
me: Yes every object that surrounds a long
frequented home; however minute, at such a
moment, demands a tearful sigh—each tree,
each flower, nay every blade of grass that
adorns, every leaf that embowers the humble
cot, becomes an object of admiration and
solicitude, when we reflect we never may
behold them more. If thus moved by
minor objects, how much more must I endure,
to separate from thee, friends and companions
in my toils! Brave Spaniard, to thy care, I
submit the superintendance of the island—act-<
ing in all things, as I am convinced you will
for the general welfare, I cannot resign it into
abler hands, for Atkins and his wife 1 have full
pardon, on condition that they remain freely
here; and in these instructions, (giving Span-
iard a large sealed packet,) as you will see sir,
have fully provided for their comfoft, as well
as for that of any others who may be inclined
to settle here. To all of whom similar ad van*
tages are secured. This being premised, let
me hear if there be any claimants.
Simon. Why sur, as Captain have promised
I my discharge, and my cousin Sally be settled
here like, I should wish if your honor pleases,
to become a freeholder of my own farm, and
if so be as Jenny here keeps her word to I,
about marrying, why I thinks I shant be sorry
tho' I ha' quitted the Itoyal Marines,
75
Miss P. Well Jenny as you please?
Jenny takes Simoris hand.
Oh! take your simple Simon Noddy by all
means. But why do I say any thing—the Nod-
dies are a very numerous family all over the
world.
Simon. Why beloikes they mought be my
lady, but I does not think there be a larger
family of them, then there be of the Puff's.
Meschec. Veil I hopes you remember our
partnership, Mr. Simon.
Simon. Ee's we go halves in every thing—~
except oiy wife.
Atkifis. What are you going to stay behind
my old boy?
Meschec. Certainly, for a few years ma tear,
I shall trade about vid Mr. Simon's goods, and
pesides, I should like to be a freeholder, for
vonce, its more den dey vou'd let ma be in
Rosemary Lane.
Friday conies from boat, Ben comes
down to Atkins.
Friday. Canoe right rnassa, me have take
leave my fader, me ready go to England.
Crusoe. Before 1 depart let me be assured
that all are satisfied.
Miss P. I am sure I'm not satisfied (aside)
I Sir shall accompany you, without my attend-
ant, as my wardrobe is still on board, I need
not delay your sailing; and when I get back
to Candlewick-ward, I shall dissuade all my
female acquaintance from the mad scheme of
$oing to India m these days, ori a matrimonial
70
expedition—though this caution will be need-
less, for "example is stronger than precept,"
and as Miss Arabella Puff, returns unsuccess-
ful, no hope remains, I think for any one else.

A gun fires from ship, (in offing) visibly.
Flag hoisted and sails set.
Captain. Worthy sir, all is prepared, for
your reception on board, by that signal.
Crusoe. I attend it, (to Juan) in compli-
ment to you sir, let this spoj; on which 1 have
passed so great a portion of my life, bear your
name, and be known to future navigators, as
the island of Juan Fernandez, as founder
of this colony, let me hope that peace, unani-
mity and good will towards J each other,
may reign in the breasts of its inhabitants.
Be assured I shall neglect ijo opportunity of
contributing to your comforts, 3md to hear
that your government flourishes will ever glad
the heart of ROBINSON CRUSOE, who
now with thanks for your good wishes and
indulgence of his many errors, reluctantly bid^
these his dear best friends a sad, though he
hopes not a last farewell.
