PREFACE,
S the Design of every Thing
is said to be first in the In-
tention, and last in the
Execution; so I come now
to acknowledge to rsty Reader, That
the present work is not merely the
product of the two first Volumes,
but the two first Volumes may rather
be called the product* of this: The
Fable is always made for the Moral,
not the moral for the Fable.
I have heard, that the envious and
ill-disposed Part of the World have
rais d fome Objections against the
two first Volumes, on Pretence, for
want of a better Reason; That (as
they fay) the story is feign'd,' that
the Names are borrowed, and that
A z it
 
Robinson Crusoe's* it is alia Romance; that there never
were any such Man or place, or Cir-
cumstances in any Night life*; that
it is all form'd and embelliflid by
Invention to impofeupon the world. I Robinson Crusoe being at this
Time in perfect and found Mind and
Memory, Thanks be to God there-
fore; do hereby declare, their Obje*
ction is an Invention scandalous in
Design, and false in fact ; and do
affirm, that the story, though Alle-
gorical, is also Historical; and that
it is the beautiful Representation of a
Life of unexampled Misfortunes,and
of a Variety not to be met with in
the world, sincerely adapted to, and
intended for the common Good of
Mankind, and designed at first, as it
is now farther apply to the most
serious Uses possible.
Farther, that there is a Man alive,
and well known too, the actions of
whose Lifeare the just Subject of these
Vo-
P R E F A C E
volumes, and to whom all or most
Part of theStory most directly alludes,
this may be depended upon for Truth,
and to this I set my name. The famous History of DonQuixot,
a work which thousands read with
pleasure, to one that knows the
meaning of it, was an emblematic
History of, and a just Satyr upon the
Duke -de Medina Sidonia; a person very remarkable at that TimcinSpam;
To those who knew the original, the
figures were lively and easily disco-
vered themselves, as they are also
here, and the Images were just; and
therefore, .when a malicious, but
foolisti Writer, in the abundance of
his Gall, spoke of the Quixotism of
R. Crusoe, as he called it, he shewed
evidently, that he, knew nothing of
what he said; and perhaps will be
a little startled, when I shall tell
him, that what he,meant for a Satyr,
was the greatest of Panegyricks.
A 3" Witt
Without letting the Reader into a
nearer explication of the Matter, I
Eroceed to let him know, that the
appy deductions I have employed myself to make from all the Cir-
cumstances of my Story, will abun-
dantly make him amends for his
not having the Emblem explained
by the Original; and that when in
my Observations and Reflexions of
any Kind in this Volume, I mention
my Solitudes and Retirements, and
allude to the Circumstances of the
former Story, all those parts of the
Story are real Facts in my History, whatever borrow'dLights they maybe
represented by: Thus the Fright and
Fancies which succeeded the Story of
the Print of a Man s Foot,and Surprise
of the old Goat, and the thing roll-
ling on my Bed, and my jumping
out in a fright, are all Histories ana-
real Stories; as are likewise the Dream
of being taken by Messengers, being.
arrested by Officers, the Manner of
being driven on Shore by the Surge of
the Sea, the Ship on Fire, the Descrip-
tion of starving; theiftory of my Man
Friday, and many more most material
Pastages obferv a here, and on which
any religious reflections are madey
are all historical and true in fact: It is most real, that I had a Parrots
and taught it to call me by myName,
such a Servant a savage, and after-
wards a Christian, and that his name was called Friday, and that he was
ravifh'd from me by Force, and died
in the Hands that took him, which I
fepfefent by being killed; this is all
literally true, and should Tenter in-
to Discoveries, many alive can testify
them: His other conduct and As-
sistance to me also1 have just Referen-
ces in all their parts to the Helps I had
from that faithful savage, in my real
Solitudes and Disasters.
A 4 the
The Story of the Bear in the Tree,
and the Fight with the wolves in the
snow, is likewise Matter of real Hi-
story j and in a word, the Adven-
tures of Robinson Crusoe,are, one
whole Scheme of a real Life of eight
and twenty years, spent in the
most: wandring desolate and afflict-
ing Circumstances that ever Man
went through, and in which I have
liv'd so long in a Life of Wonders in
concinu'd Storms, fought with the
worse kind of Savages and Man-
eaters, by unaccountable supposing
incidents j fed by Miracles greater
than that of Ravens, suffered all
manner of violence and Oppres-
sions, injurious Reproaches, con-
tempt of Men, Attacks of Devils,
Corrections from Heaven,andOppo-
sions on Earth; have had innumera-
ble Ups and Downs in matters of
Fortune, been in Slavery worse than
Turkish escaped by an exquisite
Manage-
Management, as that in the Story of
jury,and the Boat at Sallee, teen
taken up at Sea in Distress, raised a gain and depressed again, and that
oftner perhaps in one Man's life than ever was known before; Ship-
wrecked often, tho' more by land than by Sea: In a word, there's not
a Circumstance in the imaginary Sto-
ry, but has its inst Allusion to a
real Story, and chimes Part for part, and Step for Step with the inimitable
Life of Robinson Crusoe.
In like Manner, when in these Re-
flections, I speak of the Times and
Circumstances of particular actions done, or Incidents which happened
in my Solitude and Island-Life,
an impartial Reader will be so just
to take it as it is; Ga.that it is spo-
ken or intended of that Part of the
real story, which the Island-Life is a
just Allusion to; and in this the
Story is not only illustrated, but the
real
teal Part I think most justly approved:
For example,in the latter Part of
this work called the Vision, I begin
thus, whenI digin my IflartdKing-
dom, I had abundance of strangenotionsof, my feeing Apparitions^
ccc all these reflections are just Hi-
story of a State of sored Confine-
ment, which in my real history is
represented by a confin'd Retreat
in an Island; and 'tis as reasonable to
represent \am kind of Imprisonment
by another, as it is to represent any
thing that really exists,- by that
which, exists not. The storyof my
fright with something on my bed, was word for word a history of
what happened, and indeed $11 those
things received very little Altera-
tion, except what necessarily attends
removing the scene from one place to another.
My Observations uponsolitude are the same? and I think I need fey
no1
no more, than that the same Remark
is to be made upon all the References
made here, to the Transactions of the
former Volumes, and the Reader is
desired to allow for it as he goes on.
Besides all this, here is the just and
only good End of all Parable or Al-*
kgorick History brought to pafs,w^.
for moral and religious Improve-
ment Here is invincible Patience
recommended under the worst of
Misery; indefatigable Application
and undaunted Resolution under
the greatest and most discouraging
Circumstances I fay, these, are re-
commended, as the. only way net work through those Miseries, and
their Success appears sufficient to
support the most dead-hearted Crea*
tore in the World.
Had the; common way of writing a Mans private History been ta-
ken^ and I had given you the con- duel: or Life of a, man you knew?
and
Robinson Crusoe' s and whose Misfortunes and Infirmi-
ties; perhaps you had sometimes un-
justly triumph'd overall I could have
said would have yielded no Diver-
sion, and perhaps scarce have obtain-
ed a reading, or at best no Attention;
the teacher, like a greater, having
no Honour in his own Country-
Facts that are form'd to touch the
Mind, must be done a great way off,
and by somebody never heard of:
Even the miracles of the Blessed Sa-
viour of the World suffered ^corn
and Contempt, when it was reflected,
that they were done by the Carpen-
ters Son? one whose Family and O-
riginal they had a mean Opinion of,
and whose Brothers and Sisters were
ordinary People like themselves.
There even yet remains a Que-
stion, whether the instruction of
these Things will take place, when
you are supposing the Scene, which
is placed so far of5 had its original so near Home. " But
Preface.But I am far from being anxious
about that, seeing I am well aflur'd,
.that if the Obstinacy of our age should shut'their Ears against the just
Reflections made in this Volume,
upon the Transactions taken notice of in the former, there will come an
age, when the Minds of Men shall
be more flexible, when the Prejudi-
ces of their Fathers shall have no
place, and when the Rules of Ver-
tue and Religion justly recommend-
ed, shall be more gratefully accep-'
ted than they may be now, that
our Children may rife up in Judg-
ment against their fathers, and one
generation be edified by the fame
teaching, which another Generation
had despised.

The Riddle is now expounded, and the inte
ligent Reader may fee clearly the endand De
sign of the whole Work; that it is calculated fory
and dedicated to the improvementand Instru-
ction of Mankind in the waysof Venue and

to which mankindis exposed ] and encouraging
such as fall into ordinary or extraordinary Ca-
sualties of Use, how to work thro9 Difficulties
with unwearied diligenceand Application,

The Observations and Reflections, that take
up this volume,crown the Work; if the Do-
ctrine has been accepted, the Application must of
fjecejfity please; and the authorshowsnow,
that he has le ar fid sufficient Experience^ how
to make other Men wifeand himself happy.The Moral of the Fable, as the Author calls
it, is ?no(l instructing; and those who challenged
him most maliciousty, with not making his penuseful, will have Leisure to reflect, that they
past'd their Censure too soon; and likeSolis{nonV Fool, judged of the Matter before they
heard it.
Those whose Avarice prevailing over their
Honesty, had invaded the Property of this
Book by a corrupt Abridgment, have both fail}d
in their hope,and been ashamed of the fact}shifting off the guiltas well as they'could, tho', weakly, from oneto another: The principal Py-
rate is gone to his Place, and we fay no more
of him, pe mortuis nil nisi bonum; His Satis-
faction

Have frequently look'd back, you mzf

Thoughts, upon the ^Motions of a
long tedious Life of Solitude, which
J have represented to the World*
and of which you must have formed some Ideas
from the Life ot a Man in an Island, Sometimes

iffev seeing%%the whole-View ofijfe Sta|e
"of'"l4fe which we act upon in1 this world, it
seems to me,that Life i;x general is, or ought to be, but one universal Act of Solitude: Butlfi^ditis
natural to judge 9s Happiness, by its fruiting or
..nkstutirig our ojtfnjfeicli^
revolves in our Minds by innumerable circular
.•Motions^; all ceniragvin our selves. We-judge
of Prosperity, and of affliction, Joy and Sorrow,
Poverty, Riches, -and; all the various. Scenes of
Life: I fay,, we judge of them by oftrfelvds: Thi-
ther we" bring them Home, as'Meats, touch tjhe
Patet, by which we . try; them; the gay .part :'of
the World, or the heaVy.Part; it ,iV all one, they
only call'it pleasant or unpleasant, . astthey suit
our Taste.
The World, I say,.is nothing tQ^sAi|ut as it
is more or less to our Relisli: All Reflection is
carry'd Home, and our Dear-selUs> in one respect, the End of Living. Hence Man may be proper-
ly said to be alone in the midst of the Crowds .
and'Hunry of men and Business: All ^Refle-
ctions which he makes, are to himself,- all that
is pleasant, he embraces* for himself ^ all that is
irksome and grievous; l is-tasted but by his own
Palat.
Sh are the Sbfrd*rsi*of other men* to us} And
what their Joy? 'Something we may^ be tbuch'd
indeed with, by the power of sympathy, 'and a
secret'Turn of the affections 5 but all the solid
reflection is directed to our selves. • our Medi-
tations are all Solitude in perfection j our Passions
are
t?3
are all exercised in Retirement; we love, we hate?
We covet, we enjoy, all in Privacy and Solitude:
All that we communicate of those Things to any
other, is but for their assistance in the Pursuit of
bur Desires; the end is at Home; the Enjoys mint, the Contemplation, is all Solitude and Re-
tirement; 'tis for our selves we enjoy, and for our selves we suffer.
What then is the Silence ofLife? And, How
is it afflicting, while a Man has the Voice of his
Soul to (peak to God, and to himself? That Man
<ean never want Conversation, who is Company
for himself; and he that cannot converse profita-
bly with himself, is not fit for any Conversation
at all; and yet there are many good Reasons why
a Life of Solitude, as Solitude is now understood
by the Age, is.not at all suited to the Life of a
Christian, or of a wise Man. Without enquiring
therefore into the Advantages of Solitude, and
how it is to be managed, I desire to be heard
concerning what Solitude really is; for I must con-
fess, I have different Notions about it* far from
those which are generally understood in the World,
and far from all those Notions upon which those
People in the primitive Times, and since that also,
acted, who separated themselves into Desarts
and unfrequented Places* or confined themselves to
Cells, Monasteries, and the like, retired, as they
call it, from the World; All which, I think,
have nothing of the thing I call Solitude in them,
nor do they answer any of the true Ends of Solitude,
much less those Ends which are pretended to be
sought after, by those who have talk'd most of
those Retreats from the World.
As for Confinement in an Island, if the Scene
was plac'd there for this very End, it were not at
all amiss, t must acknowledge* there was Con-
B a finement,
finement from the enjoyments? 0f the Worlds and
Restraint from hum#n( Society : But ~M thatwasno Solitude] indeed.no ,part of it was ib, except
that (which, as in hi story, I afxply'd to% the
Contemplation of sublime Things) and that was
but a very little, as my readers well know, com- par'd to what a length of Years my lorced Retreat
lasted."' .'"
It isVetident then,-that as I Izttxpxhmg but
what is far from being retired, in the, iot^cedRer
treat of an island, the thoughts being in mo Com-
posure suitable to a retired Condition,can not fora
greatWhile; so I can affirm, that! enjoy much more
Solitmde in the Middle of the greatest collection of Mankind in the World, I mean, at London^
while I am writing this, than ever J could fay I
enjoy ?d in eight and twenty Years Confinnemenfe
to a desolate Island*
I have heard of a Man, that upon some extrao^
dinary Disgust which he took at the unsuitable
Conversation of same of his nearest Relations*
whose Society he could notavoid, suddenly resolved
never to speak any more: He kept his Resolution
most rigorously many years,- not all the Tears or
Entreaties of his Friends, no not of his Wife and
Children, could prevail with him ,to break his Si-
lence. It seems it was their ill Behaviour to him
at first, that was the occasion of it; for they
treated him with provoking language, which
frequently put him into undecent Passions, and ur-
ged him to rash Repliesi and he took this severe
Way to punish himself forbeing prdvok'd^nd to pu-
nish them for provoking him: but the severity was
unjustifiable $ it ruined his Famijy^and broke t hisMouse i His Wife could not bear ir, and after
endeavouring, by a1! the Ways possible, to alter his
rigid' Silence, went first away from him, and af-
terwards
[5]
/
ter wards away, from herself turning melancholly
and distracted z. His Children separated some one
Way, and some another. Way, and'only one
Daughter who lov'd her Father above all the rest,
kept with him* tended himr talked to him by
Signs, and liv'd almost Dumb like her Father,
-pear 2? Years with him > till being very sick,
and in a high Fever, delirious as we call it, or
light-headed, be broke his Silence, not knowing
when he did it, and spoke, tho* wildly at first.
He recovered of the Illness afterwards, and fre-
quently talk'd with his Daughter, but not much,
and very seldom to any Body else.
Yet this Man did not live a silent Life ^ith
respect to himself; he read continually; and wrote
down many excellent Things, which deserved to
haveappear'd in the World, and was often heard
so pray to God in his Solitudes very audibly, and
with great Fervency; but the Unjustice which his
rasli Vow, if it was a Vow, of Silence, was to his
iPamify, and the length he carry M it, was so un-
justifiable another way, that I cannot fay his In-
structions could have much Force in them*
- Had he be^n a single Man,had he wandred into a
strange "Country' or Place, where the Circum-
ftanc$ qf it had been no Scandal, his Vow of
Silence might* ha' been as commendable, and as
I think, ixjuch æiore than any of the primitive
Christians Yaws' of Solitude were; whose Re-
treat into the Wilderness, and giving themselves up
to Prayer and Contemplation, slimming human So-
ciety, and the like, was so much esteemed by the
primitive Fathers, and from whei ce our religious
Houses, and Orders of religious people were firf|
deriv'd. 1 1,4'
The Jews said, John the Baptist had a Devil,
because ne affected Solitude and Retirement} and
B 3 thejr
... , r<5]
tliey took it from an old Proverb they had in th$
World at that time: "that every solitary Person musk
be an Angel or a Devil. . , ,
A Man under a Vow of perpetual Silence, if
but rigoroufly observed, would be even on the Ex-
change of London^ as perfectly retired from the
. World, as a Hermit in his Cell ; or a Solitair in
the Desarts of Arabia; and if he i? able to ob-
serve it rigorously, may reap all the Advantages
of those Solitudes, without the unjustifiable Part
of such a Life, and without the Austerities of a
Life among Brutes. For the Soul qf a Man unr
der a due and regular Conduct, is as capable of
reserving it self, or separating it self from the rest
of human Society, in the midst of a Throng, as
it is when banisii'd into a desolate Island.
The Truth is, that all those religious Hermit-
like Solitudes, which Men value themselves so
much upon, are but an Acknowledgment of the
•Defect or Imperfection- of our Resolutions, our
. Incapacity to bind our selves to needful Restraints,
or rigoroufly to observe the Limitations we hav?
vow d our selves to observe: Or take it thus, That
the Man first resolving that it would be his Feli-
city, to be entirely given up to conversing only
with Heaven, and heavenly Things, to be sepa-
rated to Prayer and good Works; but being sen-
sible how ill such a Life will agree-with Flesh and
Blood, causes his Soul to commit a Rape upon .his
Body, and to carry it by Force, as it were into
a Desart, or into a religious Retirement, from
whence it cannot return, and where it is impossible
for it..to have any Converse with Mankind* other
than with such as are under the fame Vows, and
the fame Banishment* The Folly of this is evident
many Ways.
I shall
f 73'
1M1 bring it home to the,Gase in Hand thwsi:
Christians may without doubt, come to enjoy all
the desirable Advantages of Solitude, by a strict
retirement, and exact Government of their
thoughts, without any of these Formalities,.Ri-
gours, and apparent Mortifications, which I think
I justly call a Rape upon human Nature, and conse-
quently without the Preach of Christian Duties,
which they necessarily carry with them, such as
rejecting Christian Communion, Sacraments, Or-
dinances, and the like.
There is no need of a Wilderness to wander
among wild, Beasts, no necessity of a Cell on the
top of a Mountain, or a desolate island in the
sea > if the$ Mind be confin'd, if the Soul be truly
Master of m self, all is safe; for it is certainly and
effectually Master of the Body, and what signify
Retreats, especially a forc'd Retreat as mine was?
The anxiety of my Circumstances there, I can assure
you, was such for a Time, as were very suitable
to heavenly Meditations, and even when that was
got over, the frequent Alarms from the Savages,
put the soul sometimes to such Extremities of
Fear and Hojrour, that all manner of temper was
lost, and I was no more fit for religious Exercises,
than a sick, Man is fit for Labour.
Divine Contempla^ns require a Composure
of Soul, uninterrupted by any extraordinary Mo-
tions or. Disorders of the Passions; and this, I
^ay, is much easier to be obtained and enjoy'd in
the ordinary Course of Life, than in Monkish Cells
#nd forcible Retreats.
The Business is to get a retired Spul, a Frame.of
Mind truly elevated above ,the Worlds and • then
we may be 'alone whenever we please, in the
greatest apparent Hurry of Business or Com-
pany: Ik, the .Thoughts'are free, and rightly un-
B 4 engag'd
C 8 ]
jjngag'd, What imports the Employment the Bo dy is engaged in? Does not the Soul act by a dis*
fering Agency, and is not the Body the Servant,
pay, the Slave of the Soul? Has the Body Hands
so act, or Feet to walk, or Tongue, to speak,
but by the Agency of the Understanding, and
Will, which are the two deputies of the soul's Power? Are not all the affections, and all the
Passions which so universally agitate, direct, and
possess the Body, are they not all seated in th$
Soul? What have we to do then more or less, but
to get the Soul into a superior Direction and Ele-
vation,, there's- no Need to prescribe the Bo-
dy to this or that Situation the Hands, or Feet,
or tongue, can no more disturb the Retirement of
the Soul, than & Man having Money in his Pocket
can take it out, or pay it, or dispose of it by his
hand, without his own Knowledge,
It is the Soul's being entangled by outward ObJ
jects, that interrupts its Contemplation of divine
objects, which is the Excuse for these Solitudes,
#nd makes the removing the body from those out-
ward objects seemingly necessary but what is
thereof Religion in all this? For Example, a vi-
cious inclination s from the object, is fti|l
# vicious Inclination, andcontracts the fame Guilt,
as if the object were at Hand; for if, as our
Saviour fays, He that lopketh on $ Womaff to lustafterher,that is, to desire her unlawfully, has
committed the Adultery already $ so it w:ftl,b$ po
Inverting our Saviour's meaning to fay, that he that thinketh of a Woman to desire hp unlawfully,
has committed Adultery with her already, though
he has not looked on her, or has not seen her at
that Time $ #nd how shall this thinking of her b$
fpmov'd by transporting the Body? It must be
^JRPY*4 oithf £han^ th$ £ bringing
theMind to behove the Power or Reach of the
allurement, and to an absolute Mastership over
.the wicked Desire; otherwise the vicious Desire
remains as the force remains in the Gunpowder,
and will exert jit self whenever toucht with the
Fire. All Motionsto Good or Evil are in the Soul:
Outward objects are but second Causes; and tho' it is true, separating the Man from the object, is
the way remake apy A# impossible to be come mitted; yet where the Guilt does not lye in the Act only, but in tlje Intention or Desire to com-
mit it, that Separation is nothing at all, and ef-
fects nothing at all. There may be as much Adul*
tery committed in a Monastery, where a Woman
never comes, as in any other Place, and perhaps
is so: The abstaining from Evil therefore depends
not only and wholly upon limiting, or confining
the Man's actions, but upon the Man's limiting
and confining his Desires ; seeing to desire to sin,
is to $in \ and the fact which we would commit
if we had Opportunity, is really committed, and
must be answer 'd for as such. What then is,
there of Religion, I fay, in fore'd Retirements
from the world, and Vows of Silence or Soli-
tude? They are all nothing \ 'tis a retired Soul
that alone is fit for Contemplation; and it is the
Conquest of our Desires to sin, that is the only
human )?reservative against Sin.
It was a great while after I came into human
society, that I felt some regret at the Loss of the
solitary Hours and Retirements I had in the I slahd; but when I came to reflect upon some ill
spent time, even in my Solitudes, I found Rea-
son to see what I have said above; that a Man
may sin alon$ several Ways, and find subject of
Repen-
. C to ]
Repentance for his solitary Crimes as well as he
may in the midst of a populous City.
The Excellency of any State of Life consists
in its Freedom from Crime; and it is evident to
our Experience, that some Society may be better
adapted to a rectitude of Life, than a compleat
Solitude and Retirement: Some have said, <that
next to no Company, good Company is test; but it is my
Opinion, that next to good Company, no companyis
best > for as it is certain, that no Company" is better
than BadCompany, so 'tis as certain, that good Com-
pany is much better than no company.In Solitude a Man converses with himself, and
as a wife Man said, he is not always sure that he
does not converse with his Enemy > but he that
is in good Company, is sure to be always among
his Friends.
The Company of religious good Men, is a
constant Restraint from Evil,and an Encouragement
to a religious life. You have there the Beauty of
Religion exemplified; you never want as well In-
struction in, as Example for, all that is goods you
have a Contempt of evil Things constantly re-
commended, and the affections moved to delight
in what is goodby hourly Imitation: If we are
alone, we want all these, and are led right* or led
wrong) as the Temper of the Mind, which is
sometimes too much the Guide of our actions, as
well as Thoughts, happens to be constituted at that
time* Here we have no restraint upon our
Thoughts, but from our selves, no restraint upon
our actions, but from our own consciences, and
nothing to assist us in our Mortifications of our
Desires, or in directing our Desires, but our own reflections, which after all may often err, often
be prepossess'd.
If
[ II ]
If you would retreat from the World then, be {ure to retreat to good company,* retreat to Good Books, and retreat to good Thoughtso' these will
always assist one another, and always join to assist
him that flies to them in his Meditations, di-
rect him to just Reflections, pd mutually encou-
rage him against whatever may attack him, from
within him, or without him: whereas to retreat
from the World, as it is call'd, is to retreat from
good Men, who are our best Friends: Besides,
to retreat, as we call it to an entire Perfect Soli-
tude, is to retreat from the publick Worship of
.God, to forsake the Assemblies; and, in a Word,
is unlawful, because it obliges us to abandon
those Things, which we are commanded to do.
Solitude therefore, as I understand by it, a
Retreat from human society, on a religious or
philosophical Account, is a meer Cheat; it nei-
ther can answer the End it proposes, or qualify
us for the Duties of Religion, which we are com*
xnandfe4 t0 perform; and is therefore both irreli-
gious in it self, and inconsistent with a Christian
Life many Ways, Let the Man that would reap
the Advantage of Solitude, and that understands
the meaning of the Word, learn to retire into
himself: Serious Meditation is the Essence of So-
litude; all the Retreats into Woods and Desarts
are short of this,- and though-a Man that is per-
fectly Master of this Retirement, may be a little
in Danger of Quietism, that is to fay, of an Af-
fectation of Reservedness yet it may be a Slander
upon him in the main,^ and he may make himself
amends upon the World, by the blessed Calm of
his Soul, which they perhaps who appear more
^hearful may have little of,
# Retiring into Desarts, in the first Days of Reli-
gion, andinto Abbeys and Monasteries sip.ee,
what
what have they been? Or what have they been$ able to do, to wards purchasing the Retirement I
speak of? They have indeed been Things to b^
reckoned among Austerities, and Acts of Mortifir
cation, and so far might be commendable: But I must insist upon it3 that a retired Soul is not affe-
cted with them, any more than with the Hurries
of Company and Society. When the Soul of a
Man is powerfully engag'd in any particular Project, 'tis like that of St. Paul, wrapt P,whether
it be into the third Heaven, or to any Degree
of lower Exaltation : Such a Man may well fay
with the Apostle above, Whether I was in the Body,
orout of the Body, I cannot tell,it was.in such a
wrapt up State, that I conceived in what I call my
Vision of the Angelical World \ of which I have
here subjoined a very little part. Is it rational to believe, that a Mind exalted so
far above the State of Things with which we ordi-
narily converse, should not be capable of a sepa-
ration from them, which, in a Word, is the ut-*
ynost Extent of Solitude? Let such never afflict
themselves, that they cannot retreat from the
World: Let them learn to retreat in the World,
and they shall enjoy a perfect Solitude; as com-
pleat to all Intents and Purposes, as if they were
to live in the Cupola of St. Paul's, or, as if they
were to live upon the Top of Cheviot HL1 in
Northumberland.
They that cannot be retir'd in this Manner,
must not only retire from the World, but out of
the World, before they can arrive to any true$ Solitude. Man is a Creature so form'd for Socie-
ty, that it may not only be said, that it is not *
good for him to b$ alone, but -tis really impos-
sible he should be alone: \fea^so continually in
need of one another; na'jvin such absolute Ne-
cessity
^effity of^Affistance from one another, that those
who have pretended to give us the Lives and
.manner of the Solitaires, as they call them, who
separated themselves from Mankind, and wander'd
in the Desarts of Arabia and Lybia, are frequently
% put to the Trouble of bringing the Angels down from Heaven to do one Drudgery or another for
xthem; forming imaginary Miracles, to make the
life of a true Solitair possible sometimes they
have no Bread, sometimes no Water, for a long
Time together; and then a Miracle is brought
,upon the Stage, to make them live so long with-
out Food ,* at other Times they have Angels come to bi: pbkk Cooks, and bring them Roast-meat; to
Jbp fheir Physicians, to bring them Physick, and
the likeIf Saint Hillary comes in his Wan-
d-rings to the River Nile, an humble Crocrodile
js brought to carry him over upon his Back; tho'
.they do not tell us, whether the Crocodile askM
him to ride, ot he ask'd the crocodile, or by what
Means they came to be so familiar with one ano-
ther; And what is all this to the Retirement of
the Soul, with which it converses in Heaven in
the midst of infinite Crowds of Men, and to whom,
the nearest of other objects is nothing at-all, any
more than the objects of Mountains and Deserts, Lions and Leopards, and the like, were to those
that banish'd themselves to Arabia?
, Besides, in a State of Life, where Circumstan-
ces are easy, and Provision for the Necessaries of
Life, which the best Saint cannot support the
Want of, is quietly and plentifully made; has not
the Mind infinitely more Room to withdraw
from the World, than when at best it must wan -
dee for irs daily Food, tho* it were but the Pro-
4iu5t of the field. Let
t H 3
Let no Man plead he wants Retirement, thathe loves Solitude; But cannot enjoy it, because of
the Embarrassment of the World; 'tis all a Delusi-
on4, if he loves it,* if he desires it, he may have it
when* Where, &andas often at he pleases; let his
Hurries, his Labours, or his afflictions, be what
they will: It is not the Want of an Opportunity
for Solitude, but the Want of a capacity of being
jfolitairy that1 is the Cafe in all tfie Circumstances
of Life.
I knew a poor, but good Man vtrho tho' he was
a Labourer, was a Man of Sense and Religion j
who being hard at Work, with some other men, removing a great quantity of Earth to raise a
Bank against the Side of a Pond, was one Day so
out of himself, arid wrapt up in a perfect Appli-
cation of his Mind, to a very serious subject, that the poor Man drove himself and his Wheel-
barrow into the Pond, and could not recover him-
self, till Help came to him- This* Man was cer-
tainly capable of a perfect Solitude, and perhaps
really enjoyM it; for as I have often heard him
fay, he liv'd alone in the World: (i.)'Had no
family to embarrass his affections. (2.) His low Circumstances placed him below the Observation
of the upper Degrees of Mankind. (3.) And his
reserved'Meditations placed him above the wicked
Part, who were those in a Sphere equal to him-
self y among whom, as he said, and is most true,
it was very hard to find a sober Man, much less a
good Man; ' so that he liv'd really alone in the
World; apply'd himself to labour for hisSubsistance,
had no other Business with Mankind, but for Ne-
cessaries of Life, and conversed in Heaven, as ef-
fectually, and, I believe, every Way, as divinely
as St. Hilarydid in the Desartsof Lybia, among the Lions and Crocodiles.
If this retirement, which they call Solitude, con-
sisted only of separating the Person from the world,
that is to say, from human Society, it were itself
,3 very mean Thing, and would every Way as well
be supplied, by removing from a Place where a
Man is known, to a Place where he is not known,
arid there accustom himself to a retiYd Life, ma-
king no new Acquaintance, and only making the
Use of Mankind which I have already spoken of
namely for Convenience, and Supply of necessary
Food; and I think of the Two, that such a Man,
or a Man so retired, may have more Opportunity
to be an entire Recluse, and may enjoy more real
Solitude, than a MaP:in a Desart,' For Example,
• - In the solitude I speak of, a-Maji has no more
. to-doforthe:>Nece{Faries of Life^than to receive
them from the hands, of those that are to furnish
them, and pay them < for so doing; whereas, in
the Solitude of Deserts, and wandring Lives, from
whence, all our Monkisli Devption. springs, they -
,had every I?ay their. Food, such as it was, to
seek, or. the Load of it to carry; and except where
as it is said, they put Providence, to, the Opera-
tion of a Miracle, to furnish it, they jiad frequently
Difficulties enough to sustain life,- and if .we
may believe History, many of them were starved to Death for meer Hunger, or Thirst and as
often the latter as the former. Those that had Recourse to these solitudes, merely as a Mortification of their Bodies, as I
observed before, and delivering themselves from the
temptations] which Society exposed them to,
had more Room for the Pretence indeed, than
those who alledge they did it to give ud them-
selves to Prayer and Meditation, The first might
have some- Reason in Natute for the fact, as
x Men

Mens Tempers and Constitutions might lead. I

to another $ thd the Christian Religion 'dbe^s
not guide us to those Methods of putting
a Force upon our Bodies to subdue ::;the
Violence of inordinate Appetite* The blessed
Apostle St Paul, seems to have been in this
Circumstance* when being assaulted with what is
called in the Texty a Thorn in the Flesh; be it what
it will that* is meant there, it is not to my Pur-
pose; but he prayed t© the Lord thrice; that w&s
the firstMethod the Apostle took5 and thereby set
a pious -Example to all those who are aslkulted by
any Temptation. He did not immediately fly
to Austerities and bodily Mortifications, sepata-
ting himself from Mankind, or flying into the
Desart to give himself up;' to Fasting1, and a Re-
treat from the World, which is ^ Object of kll
private Snares But he applied himself by serious
Praydr to him* who had tadght us to pray* Lead
tk not intoTemptation; and the Answer likewise is
instructing in the Cafe; he was not d riven ofrt as
Nebuchadnezzar into the Defart; he* was not œmr
xrfanded to retire into the Wilderness, that hel
might be free froth the Temptation ,* nothing less:
But the Answer w&s, my Grace is sufficient for the^
sufficient without the tielp of artificail Mortified
tion. . , / t'
So that even in the Case of these forcible Morti-
fications they are not i*equir*d^ much less directed
for Helps to Meditation v for if Meditation could
not be practised beneficially^ and to all the Intents
and Purposes for which it was ordained a Duty*
without flying from the Face of humah Society
the Life of Man would be very unhappy;
But
[17]
Butjdbubtlefe the Contrary is evident, and all
the par ts of a com pleat Solitude are to be as ef-
fectually enjoy M, if we please, and sufficient Grace
assisting, even in the most populous Cities, £rttong
the hurries of Conversation, and Gallantry of a
Court,or the Noise and Business of a Camp, as in
the Defarts of Arabia and Lybia, or in the desolate
life of an uninhabited island.

HEN I first came home to my own Country, and began to sit down and
look back upon the past Cirfcumstan*

but do very often; theVvery Prosperft^I enjoys

man Felicity^ thefarmwC^pjtfvity Ihad suffered,
made my Liberty swectex^to me; and to find my
self jump'd into easy Circumstances at once, from
a Condition below the common Rate of Life,
made it still sweeter.
One Time, as I was upon my Enquiries into
the happy Concurrence of the Causes which
had brought the Event of my Prosperity to
pass, as an effect, it occurr'd to my Thoughts,
how much * of it all depended, under the
Disposition of Providence, upon the Principle
of Honesty, which I met with, in almost all the
People whom it was my Lot to be concerned with
in my private and particular Affairs • and I that
had met with such extraordinary instances of the
Knavery and Villainy of Mens Natures in other
Circumstances, could not but be something taken
up
 
"E i9 3
-up 'with the Miracles of honesty that I had met
with among the several people I had had to do
, withi I mean those whom I had more particularly
to do with 'in. thief Articles of my Liberty, Estate,
after effects, which fell into their Hands.

d^ow, the Captain's Wife, with whom I first went
to the Coast of Africa, and to whom I entrusted
Wo /. being the Gain I had made in my first Ad-
ventures to Guinea-, as in the first Volume, Page
3 30, appears. >
She was left "a Widow, and in but indifferent
Circumstance's; but when I sent to her so far off as
the Brajils, where I was in suph a Condition as she
might have reasonably believed I should never
have been able to come my self; and if I had,
might be in no Condition to recover it of her;
and having my self nothing to shew under her
Hand for the Trust; yet she was so just, that she
sent the full value of what I wrote for, being
one hundred Pound; and to shew, as far as in her
lay, her sincere honest Concern for my Good, put
in among many necessary Things which I did not
write for, I fay, put in two Bibles, besides other
good Books, for my reading and Instruction, as
the said afterwards, in Popish and Heathen Coun-
tries, where I might chance to fall. Honesty not
only leads to discharge every Debt and every Trust
to our Neighbour, so far as is justly to be deman-
ded, but an honest Man acknowledges himself
debtor to all mankind, for so much Good to be done for them,- whether for Soul or Body, as Pro-
vidence puts an Opportunity into his Hands to do:
In Order to discharge this Debt, he studies
continually for Opportunity to do all the Acts of
Kindness and Beneficence, that is possible for him
to do; and tho' very few consider it, a Man is
C a jaot
not a compleatly honest Man, that, ddes not do this *
Upon this Consideration, I question much,
whether a covetous, narrow, stingy Man, adwe
call him, one who gives himself up to himself,
as born for himself only, and who declines the
Advantages and Opportunities of doing Good,
I mean, extreamly^ so: I fay, I much question,
whether such a Man can be an honest Man; nay, I
am satisfy M he cannot be honest Man for tho' he may pay every Man his own, and be just, as he" thinks it, to a Farthing; yet this is Part of the
Justice, which in the common Phrase is the grea-
test injustice. This is one Meaning of that Say-
ing, Summum jus, tinjuria.
To pay every man their own, is the common
lawof Honesty; but to do Good to all Mankind,
as far as you are able, is the Chancery Law of Ho-
nesty; and tho' in common Law or justice, as I
call it, Mankind can have no Claim upon us, if
we do but just pay our debt; yet in Heaven's
Chancery they will have Relief against us; for
they have a demand in Equity of all the Good to
be done them, that it is in our Power to do, and
this Chancery Court, or Court of Equity, is held
in every Man's Breast; 'tis a true Court of Con-
science, and every /Man's Conscience is a Lord
Chanceilour to him; if he has not perform'd,
if he has not paid this Debt, conscience will de-
cree him to pay it, on the Penalty of declaring
him a d/Jhoneft Man, even in his own Opinion;
and if he still refuses to comply, will proceed
by all the legal Steps of a Court of Conscience
Process* till at last it will issue out a Writ of Re-
bellion against him, and proclaim him a Rebel to
Nature and his own Conscience.. 1" ,
But
• But this is by the Way, and is occasioned by
the Observations I have made of many People,
who think they are mighty honest if they pay
their Debts/ and owe no Man any Thing, m they
call it; at the fame Time, like true Misers, who
lay up all for themselves, they think nothing of the
Debt of Charity and Beneficence, which they
owe to all mankind. . •'
• Rich Men are their Maker's Free-holders;
they enjoy freely the Estate he has given them the
Pofleffion ofi with all the Rents, Profits, and
emoluments, but charged with # free Farm Rent
to the'younger Children of the family, namely
the Poor; or if you will, you may call them,
God's Copyholders, paying, a Quit-Rent to the
Lord of the Manor; which Quit-Rent he has
assigned for the Use of the rest of mankind, to
be paid in a constant Discharge of all good Offi-
xes; friendly, kind, and generous actions ; and
he that will not pay»his Rent, cannot be an ho-
nest Man, any more than he that would not pay
his other just Debts.

tion of mine; the Miser is called by the Prophet

nor the Churl said to be bountiful. Here the Op-

and the Opposite to a Bountiful Man is called a, Churl; and in the Verse following, the same

In a Word, I think my opinion justify9d by this
text, that a Qi^rl^amprbse, sowre Disposition,

not be an honest man,i he does not pay the common
Debt of Mankind tp one another,nor theFee-Farm,

charged the debt upon him, I know the Miser

I come back to, counter examples I was giving in
my private Cafe.; u<A§ the WidoV-was honest to
mty so was my good Portuguese Captain; and it
is this-Man's original Honesty, that makes ,me
speak of the honest -Man's Debt t^ mankind . It,
^ras Honesty, ^ generous Honefty^ that led the,
poor Man to t&kgnje. up at Sea; which, if he had
neglected, my Boy J^r^and J f had perished toge^
ther: It was. no debt, to me;in,>particular? but
a Debt to Mankind, that he paid in that action ;
and yet he could not have been an honest manwith?
out it. You will, Jay, if he had gpne,away and
left me, he had been barbarous and, inhuman, and
dpferv'd to be. left, to perish, "himself in the like
Distress: But, Isay, thisis not,all. the Cafe: Cu-
stom and the nature of the ThingJead&usto fay, it would have been har.d-hearted and, inhuman;
But Conscience will tell any ,man, that it was, a
1 Debt,
>[2|3
BeBvkrd he could not bus-be condemned by the
Court of Conscience in his own Breast, if he had
omitted it; nay, in the sight of Heayen he had
tacitly killed -us, and had been as guilty of our
Death a^a Murtherer; ;for "he hat refuses, to. save
^Life-thrown into hisHkids, takes it away $ andif there^ is a just Retribution in a future State, if
blood is at all required there, the blood of every
man,' Woman, or Child,,wf^m we could have sa-
ved, and did not, shall be reckoned to us at that
Day,' as spilt by-our own; Hands; for leaving Life
in a Posture ?in which it .must inevitably .perish,
js ex changing it to perish, and will,
be catl'd so then, by whatever: .gilded dress'd-up
Words we may express and conceal it now-
But I go farther, for my good Portuguese: went
farther with me; he not only paid the debt he
owed to Heaven, in saving ;our lives, but he
went farther: I He took, nothing of what, I had,
tho'in the common Right of the Sea, it was all
his Hut for salvage,as the $sailors . call it: But
he gave me the Value of every Thing, bpugh£
my Boat3 which he might: have tur^d-adrift, my
Boy Xuryl who was not my Slave by anyrRight,
or if he had,, became freefrOm that Time ,- and
the Life of Xuryy which .he^had fav'd, as a Ser-
vant, was his own; yet;he bought every Thing
ofmej for the full Value* and took nothing of
me, no not for my Passage-
Here was the Liberal Man deyifeng liberal Things3
and the Sequel made good the promissory Text;
fort by' these liberal Things, the dis honest liberal
Man might be truly said to stand; When I came to
reward Mm *at my coming toX/ita, to sell my
Plantationat Brasil: Then he being poor, and
red.uc'dy ^nd notable to pay even what he ow'd
me, I gave him a Reward sufficient to make hisCircumstances easy all his Life after.
The Bounty of this Man tome, when first h&
took me up out of the Sea, was the highest and most compleat Act of Honesty; A generous Ho-
nesty, laying hold of an opportunity to do Good
to an object offered by the providence of Hea-
ven, and thereby acknowledging the Debt he had
to pay to his Maker, ^in the Persons of his most
distressed Creatures.
And here also let me remind my Readers of
what perhaps they seldom much regardit is not
only a Gift from Heaven to uh to be put in a
Condition of doing good';but 'lis a Gift, and a Fa-
vour frqp* Heaven, to have an Opportunity of
doing the goodwe are in a Condition to do; and we
ought to close with the Opportunity, as a parti-
cular Gift from above, and be as thankful for it;
I fay, as thankful for the Occasion of doing Good, as for the Ability.
I might mention here the Honesty of my fellow- Planter in the Brajtls, and of the two Merchants
and their Sons, by whose Integrity I had my
Share in the Plantation preserved, and taken care, of j as also the Honesty of the publick Treasure)?
for the Church there, and the like: But I am car-
ryMofFinmy Thoughts, to enlarge upon this no-
ble Principle, from the two Examples I have al-
ready mentioned, » the Guiney Captain's Wi*
dow, and the Portuguese; and this in particular,
because, since I came to England to reside, I have
met with abundance of Disputes about Honesty^
especially in Cases where honest Men come, to be
unhappy men, when they fall into such Circumstan-
ces as they cannot be honest, or rather, Cannot;
'{hew the Principle of Honesty, which is really
at the Bottom of all their actions, and which,
but
for thpsp^ Circumstances which entirely disa-
ble them, would certainly /hew it self in every
Branch of their Lives: Such Men I have too often seen branded for Knaves by those who,
if they come into the same Condition, would perhaps do the fame Things, or worse than they
may have done. Both my Widow and my Portuguese Captain, fell into low Circumstances, so that they could
not make good to me my money that was
in their Hands; and yet both of them fhew'd
to me, that they had not only a Principle
of Justice, but of generous Honesty too, when
the opportunity was put into their Hands to
do so.
This put me'upon enquiring and debating with
my self, what this subtle and imperceptible Thing,
called Honesty, is, and how it might be descri-.
bed \ setting down my thoughts, at several Times,
as objects presented that Posterity, if they think
them worth while, may find them both useful
and diverting. And First, I thought it not
improper to lay down the Conditions upon
which I am to enter upon that Description,*
that I may not be mistaken, but be allowed to ex-
plain what I mean by Honesty, before I undertake
to enter upon any Discourses or Observations about
it.
And to come directly to it, for 1 would make as
few Preambles as possible, I shall crave the Liberty
in all the following Discourse, to take the Term
Honesty, as.I think all English Expressions ought to
bp taken, namely Hcnesterly, in the common Accep-
tation of the Word, the general vulgar Sense of
it, without any Circumlocutions or Double. En ten*
dres whatsoever; for I desire to speak plainly
and sincerely. Indeed, as I have no Talent at hard
Words,
[ id }
Words, so I have no great Veneration for Etymo*
logies, especially in EngUJh *. But since I am trea-1
ting of Honesty, I desire to do ir, as I fay.above,'
iwyestly, according tp the genuine Signification of
the Thing. * - -
Neither shall I examine* whether Honesty-be:
a natural or an acquired Virtue, t whether a Ha- *
bit, or a Quality, whether inherent or accidentals
all the philosophical Part of it I shuse to omit,
Neither shall I examine it, as it extends to
Spirituals, and looks towards Religion; if .we en-
quire about Honesty towards God, I readily al-
low all Men are born Knaves, Villains, Thieves,'
and Murtherers, and nothing but the restraining
Power of Providence witholds us all from shew-*
ing our selves fuch^on all Occasions.
No Man can be just to his Maker; if he could,:
#11 our Creeds and Confessions, litanies and $up-<
plications, were ridiculous Contradictions- and
Impertinences; inconsistent with themselves, and
with the whole Tenor of human Life.
In all the ensuing Discourse therefore., I am to
be understood of Honefy, as it regards. Mankind
among themselves, as it looks from on6 Man' to
another, in those necessary Parts of Man's Life*
his Conversation and Negotiation, Trusts, Friend-
ships, and all the Incidents of human Affairs*
The Plainness I profess, both in Style and
Method, seems to me to have some suitable Aria-
logy to the Subject, Honesty; and therefore, is ab-
solutely necessary to be strictly followed. And I
must own, I am the better reconciled, on this very
Account, to a natural Infirmity of homely plain
Wilting; in that I think the Plainness of -Ex-'
pression, which I am condemned to, will give no
Disadvantage to my Subject, since Honesty sliews
the most beautiful, and the more like Hov$(ly%
mi
when Artifice is dismissed, and she is honestly seen
by her own Light only; likewise the same Since-
rity is required in the Reader; and he that reads
this Essay without Honest/, will never understand
it right: She must, I fay, be view d by her own Light.
If Prejudice, Partiality, or private Opinions stand
in the Way, the Mans a reading knave,heis not
honest to the subject ; and upon such an one all
the Labour is lost, this work is of no Use to
him, and by my Consent, the Bookseller for give him his Money again.
If any Man, from his private ill Nature, takes
exceptions at me, poor, wild, wicked, Robinson
Crusoe, for prating of such subjects as this is,
and shall call either my Sins, or Misfortunes to Re-
membrance, in Prejudice of what he reads ; suppo-
sing me thereby unqualify'd to defend so noble a
subject astthis of Honesty, or at least to handle it ho-
nestly: I take the Freedom to tell such, that those
very wild Wicked Doings and Mistakes of mine,
render me the properest Man alive to give War-
ning to others, as the Man that hasbeen sick is half
a Physician. Besides, the Confession which I all
along make of my early Errors, and which Provi-
dence, you fee, found me Leisure enough to re-
pent of, and I hope, gave me Assistance to do it
effectually ; assists to qualify me for the present Un-
dertaking, as well to recommend that Rectitude
of Soul, which I call Honesty to others, as to warn
those who are subject to mistake it, either in
themselves or others: Heaven it self receives those
who sincerely repent, into the same State of Ac-
p^ptance, as if they had not sinn'd at all, and so
should we alsq.
They who repent, and their ill Livesamend,
Stand, next to those who never did offend.
Nor
Nor do I think a Man ought to be afraid ot
asliamM to own and acknowledge his follies and
Mistakes,, but rather to think it a Debt which Hoxesty obliges him to pay: Besides, our infirmities and Errors, to which all Men are equally subject,
when recovered from, leave such Impressions be-
hind them, on those who sincerely repent of them,
that they are always the forwardest to accuse and
reproach themselves: No Man need advise them,
or lead them; and this gives the greatest Disco-
very of the Honesty of the Man's Heart, and Sin-
cerity of Principles. Some People tell us, they
think they need not make any open Acknowledg-
ment of their Follies; and ?tis a cruelty to exact
it of them; that they could rather dye than sub-
mit to it; that their Spirits are too great for it;
that they are more afraid to come to such publick
Confessions and Recognitions, than they would be
to meet a Cannon Bullet, or to face an Enemy:
. But this is a poor mistaken Piece of false Bravery;
all Shame is Cowardise, as an eminent Poet tells
That all courage; is Fear, the bravest Spirit
is the best qualify-d for a Penitent; 'tis a strange
Thing that we should not be ashamed to offend, but should be ashamed to repent; not afraid to
sin, but afraid to confess. This very Thought
extorted the following Lines from a Friend of
mine, with whom I discoursed upon this Head,
Among the worst of Cowards let him be namdy
Who having Jinnies afraid to be afloamd\
And to mistaken Courage he's betray d,
Who having finnd's astamd to be afraid.
But to leave the Point of Courage and Cowar-
dice in our repenting of our Offences, I bring it
back to the very Point I am wpon; namely that of
Hone,.[ *9 1
Honesty. A Man cannot 4 be truly an honest man," without acknowledging the mistakes he has made;
particularly, without acknowledging the Wrong
done to his Neighbour and why pray is Justicd
less required in his Acknowledgment to his Maker?
He then that will be honest, must dare to con-
fess he has been a Knave > for as above, speaking
of our Behaviour to God, we have been all
Knaves, and all dishonest; and if we come to
speak strictly, perhaps it would hold in our Be-
haviour to one another also; for, Where's the
Man that is not chargeable by some or other of his
Neighbours, or by himself, with doing wrong, with some Oppression of injury,' either of the
'Tongue, or of the hands. I might enlarge hereupon the Honesty of the
Tongue, a Thing some People, who call them-
selves very honest Men, keep a very slender Guard
upon, I mean, as to Evil-speaking; and of all
Evil-speaking, that worst Kind of it, the spea-
king hard and unjust Things of one another.
This is certainly intended by the Command
of God, which is so express and emphatick, Ihou
stalt nofbear false witnessagainst thy Neighbour; at
least that Part which is what we call Slander, rai-
sing an injurious and false Charge upon the Cha-
racter and Conduct of our Neighbour, and sprea-
ding it for Truth.
But this is not all; that Honesty I am, speaking
of respects all detraction, all outrageous Defaults of the Tongue ; Reproach is as really a Part
of Dishonesty, as Slander; and tho' not so aggra-
vated in Degree, yet 'tis the fame in kind There isa Kind of Murther that may be com-
mitted with the Tongue, that is in its Na-
ture as cruel as that of the Hand: This can
never
\
never be the practice, of an honest man ; Nay, he
that practises It cannot be an honest Man.
But perhaps I may come, to this again,but I must
. go back to explain<my self upon the subject a lit-
tle farther in the ^General, and then.you shall hear
more of me, as to the particulars. , 't
 
Of Honesty in GeneralHave always observed , that however
few the real honest Men are, yet e-
very Man thinks himself, and pro-
claims himself an honest Man. Ho-
ncity, hke Heaven, has' all Mens good Word, and
allMenkpretend to a Share of it: So general is the
Claim, that like a jest which is spoiled by the Re-
petition, 'tis grown of no value for a Man U
swear by his Faith,which is, in its original MeanJ
ing, by his honesty,and ought to be understood
so. .
Like Heaven too, xis little understood by those
who pretend mpst to it, 'tis too often squared ac-
cording to Mens private interest, tho' at the fame
Time the Latitude which some Men give them-
selves, is inconsistent with its Nature: -
Honesty is a general Probity of mind, an Apti-
tude to Act justly and honourably in all Cafes, re-
ligious and civil, and to all Persons superiour or
inferiour; neither is Ability or Disability to act
so, any Part of the Thing it self in this- Sense.
It may be distinguish <J into Justice and Equity' s you will, into Debt and Honour $ for both
, make up but one Honesty.

rftatdy. Whea a Gentleman loses his. Honesty, he
ceases to be a Gentleman, commences Rake from
that Minute, _and*onght to be vxs'd like qne.
Honesty has such a . general Character in the
Minds of Men, tfyat the. worst of Men,, who nei-
ther practise .or .pretend to any Part of . it, will
yet value it in others'.;.no Man ever cou'd be sq
.out of Love with it,, .as to desire/his Posterity
dhouLd he without it; n&y, such is the Veneration
all Men have for it, that th£ general Blessing of a
Father ta his Son,, is .Pray, God make thee an honest
Mam' , .
Indeed
tndieed so general is the Value of it, and so well known, that it seems needless to fay any Thing inbehalf of it. So far as it is found upon earth, so
much of the first Rectitude of Nature, and of the
Image of God, seems to be restor'd to Man-
kind.
The greatest Mischief which to me seems to
attend this Virtues like the Thorn about the
Rose, which pricks the Finger of those who med-
dle with it, is Pride: 'Tis a hard Thing for a
Man to be very honest, and not be proud of it;
and tho' he who is really honest,, has, as we fay,
something to be proud of, yet I take his Honesty to
be in a great deal of Danger, who values himself
too much upon it,
True honest Honesty, if I may be allowed such
an Expression* has the least Relation to Pride of
any View in the World j 'tis all simple, plains ge-
nuinfc, and sincere; and if I hear a Man boast of his
Honesty, I cannbt help having some Fears for him,
at least, that 'tis sickly and languishing.
Honesty is a little tender Plant, not known to
all who have Skill in Simples, Thick sow'd, as they
fay, and Thin come up; 'tis nice of Growth, it
seldom thrives in a very fat Soil and yet a very poor
Ground too is apt to starve it, unless it has taken
very good Root; when it once takes to a Piece of
Ground, it will never be quite destroy'd; it may
be choak'd with the Weeds of Prosperity, and
sometimes *tis so scorcht up with the Droughts of Poverty and Necessity, that it seems as if it were
quite dead and gone; but it always revives upon
the least mild Weather'; and if some Showets of
Plenty fall, it makes full reparation for the Loss the
Gardener had in his Crop.
There is ah ugly Weed, caird Cunn ing> which
is very pernicious to it> and which particularly
injures
injures itj by hiding it from our Discovery^ and
making it hard to find : This is so like Honesty,
that many a Man has been deceived with it, and
have taken one for t other in the Market: Nay,
I have heard of some, who have planted this wild
Honesty, as we may call itr intheir own Ground,
have made Use of it in their Friendships and Dea-
lings, and thought it had been the true Plants but they always lost Credit by it: And that was
not the worst neither for they had the Loss who
dealt with them, and who chaffer'd for a Counter-
feit Commodity and we find many deceived so
stilH which is the occasion there is such an outcry about false Friends, and about Sharping and
Tricking in Mens ordinary Dealings in the World-
This true Honesty too has some little Difference
in it, according to the Soil or Climate in which
it grows> arid your Simplers have had some DiP
putes about the Sorts of it i Nay, there have been great Heats about the several Kinds of this plant which grows in different Countries, and some call
that Honesty, which others fay, is not; as parti^
cularly they fay, -There is a Sort of Honesty id
toy Country, Torkjhire Honesty, which differs very*
much from that which is found in these southern
Parts about London: Then there is a Sort of ScottHonesty, which they fay is a meaner sort, than that of Torkjhire: And in New England, I have
heard they have a kind of honesty, which is
worse than the Scvtijh, and little better than the
wild Honesty, call d Cunning, which I mentioned
before. On the other hand, they tell us, that in
some Parts of Asia, at Smyrna, and at Constantinopie, the Turks have a better Sort of Honesty than any of us. I am sorry* our Itirkey Company have
not imported some of it, that we might try whe-
ther it would thrive here ot no: 'Tis a little odd
D to
C 34 3
to me, it should grow to such a perfection in 7^
keyy because it has always been observed to thrive best, where it is s&w'd with a Sort of Grain
callM Religion: Indeed they never thrive in these
Parts of the World, so well apart, as they do
together. And for this Reason, I must own, I have
found that Scots Honesty, as above, to be of a very
good Kind. How *tis in Turkey, I know not;
for in all my Travels, I never set my Foot in
the Grand Seignior's Dominions.
But to wave Allegories, Disputes about what
is i, or is not Honesty, are dangerous to Honesty
itself; for no Case can betdoubtful*, which does
not border upon the Frontiers of Dishonesty; and
he that resolves not to be drowned, had best ne-
ver come near the Brink of the water, That Man who will do nothing but what is barely
honest, is in great danger, 'Tis certainly just for me
-to do^very Thing the law justifies; but if I should
only square rtiy Actions by what is literally law-
ful, I must throw every debtor, tho' he be poor,
in Prison, and never release him till he has paid the
uttermost Farthing: I must hang every Malefa-
ctor without mercy, I must exact the Penalty of
every Bond, and the forfeiture of every Indeia*
t;ure: In short, I must be yneasy to all mankind, and make them so to me' ; and in a word, be a
ve,ry Knave too, as well as a Tyrant; for Cruelty
is.'not Honesty.
Therefore, the sovereign Judge of every Man's
.Honesty has laid us down a general Rule, to
which all the Particulars are resolved, Quod tibi
fieri nonvis, alteri ne feceris. This is a Part of
that Honesty I am treating of,, and which indeed
is the more essential of the two; this is the Test
of Behaviour, and the grand Article to have Re-
course to, when Laws are silent,'
I have
1 hive heard some Men argue, that they are hot bound to any such Considerations of the In*-
digence of Person's, as lead to Concessions of Titpe,
or Compositions with them for Debts; that 'tis
all ex gratia, or the effects of policy, because Che 'cumstances lead them to judge it better to take
what they can get, than lose the Whole. •
Speaking of the Letter of the Law, I allow that
they may be inthe right.
On the other hand, a Man who gives a Bond
for a debt, pleads, he is answerable for no more
than the Law will force him to that is, he may
defend a Suit, stand out to the last Extremity,
and at least keep out of the Way, so as not to have
Judgment or Execution fervid on him * he may
secure his Estate from the Execution, as well as
his Person, and so never pay the Debt at all; and
yet in the Eye of the Law be an honest man ; and
this Part of legal literal Honesty is supported on-
ly by the dther, namely, the cruel Part ,* for real-
ly such a Man, speaking in the sense of common
justice, is a Knave ; he ought to act according to
the true Intent and Meaning.of his Obligation, and
in the Right of a Debtor to a Creditor, which is
so pay him his Money when it became due, not
stand out to the last* because he cannot be forced
to it former. . The L^vs of the Country indeedr&llcw such
Actions as the Laws of Conscience 'can by no
<Means allow, as in this Cafe of the Creditor
suing for his Debt, and the debtor not paying it
till he is forced by Law. The argument made
Use of td vindicate the Morality of such a Pra-
ctice, stands thus:
If a man trusts me with his money or goods, upon my common Credit, or upon my Word, he
then takes me t his Money^and depends both D % upon
upon my Ability and my Hone-stjr; but if he
comes and demands my Bond, he quits his De-
pendence upon my Honesty, and takes the Law
for his Security; so that the Language of such an
Action is, He will have a Bond, that it may be
in his Power, to make me pay him, whether I
will or no; and as for my Honesty* he'll, have no-
shing to do with it: What Relief then I can have
against this Bond, by the fame Law, to which
the .Person refers himself, is as legal an Action on
my Side, as the other Man's suing for his own,
is on his.
And thus the Letter of the Law wilsruinethe
Honesty of both Debitor and Creditor, and yet
both shall be justify'd too.
But if I may give my Opinion in this Cafe, nei-
ther of these are the honest Man I am speaking of?
for Honesty does not consist of Negatives; and
*tis not sufficient to do my Neighbour no perso-
nal Injury in the strict Sense and Letter pf the Law >
but I am bound, where Cases and Circumstances
make other Measures reasonable, to have such Re-
gard to these Cases and Circumstances, as Rea-
son requires. Thus to begin with the Creditor
to the Debtor, Reason requires, that where a,
Man is reduced to Extremities,, he should not be
destroyed for Debt; and what's unreasonable can-
not be honest.
Debt is no capital Crime, nor ever was; and
starving Men in Prison,, a Punishment worse "than,
the Gallows, seems to be a Thing so severe, as
it ought not to be in, the Power of a, Creditor
to inflict it: The Laws of God never tolerated
such a Method of treating Debtors,, as we have^
since thought proper* I wot/t fay honest, to putJ
in Practice: But since the Politicks of the Nation,
have left the Debtor, so much at Mercy by the
/ *'' . ? Letter
137 1
Letter of the Law, *tis honest with Respect to
the Law, to proceed so; yet Compassion is in
this Cafe thought reasonable, Why Jhoudft thou
take his bedfrom under him? says the Text; which
implies, \i$ unnatural and unreasonable.
- I have heard some Men insist upon it, that if
a Man be sued wrongfully at Law, he ought ra-
ther to submit to the Injury, than to oppose the
wrong, by the same Law \ and yet I never found
those • Gentlemen so passive in Matters of Law,
but they would sue a Debtor at Law, if they could
not otherwise obtain their Right,
I confess, I cannot blame them for the last,
but I blame them for pretending to the first:
I am not arguing against recovering a just Debt
by a c law, where the Person is able, but un-
, willing, to be honest: but I think, pursuing the
debtor to all Extremities, to the turning his Wife
and Children into the Street, expressed in the
Scripture by, takinghis bedfrom underhim; and
by keeping the Debtor in Prison, when really he
is not able to pay it; there is something of Cruel-
ty in it, and the honest Man, I am speaking of,
can never do it.
But some may object, if I must serve all Man-
kind, as I would be ferv'd in like Cafe, then I
must relieve every Beggar, and release every poor
Debtor > for if I was a Beggar, I would be re-
liev'd a' and if I was in prison, I would be released;
and (o I must give away all I have. This is inver-
ting the Argument i for the Meaning is in the
Negative still, Do not to another any Thing, or put no Hardship upon another, which you would
not allow to be just, if you wer<^ in , their
cafe. Honesty is Equity, every Man is Lord Chan-
cellor to himself} and if he would consult that
D 3 Princi-
principle within him, would find Reason as faie
an Advocate for his Neighbour, as for m self: But I proceed.
Of the Tryal ^Honesty.
g^^^IEceffity makes an honest Man a Knave ^
^^^jl according to the common received No-
tion^ there would not be a,n honest poor man left alive.
A rich man, is an honest Man, no thanksto
him;for he would be a double Knave to cheat
Mankind, when he had no need of it: He has$ no Occasion to press upon his Integrity, nor so
much as to touch upon the Borders of Dishone-
sty. Tell me of a Man, that is a very honest
Man> for he pays every Body punctually, runs
into no body's Debt, does no Man Any Wrong;
very well, What Circumstances is he in? Why,
he has a good Estate* a fine Yearly Income, and
no business to do. The Devil must have full Pro session of this man, if he should be a, Knave \ for
po Man commits Evil for the Sake of it; even the
Devil himself has some farther Design in sinning, than barely the wicked Part of it. No Man is
so hardened in Crimes, as to commit them for the
meer Pleasure of the fact ; there is always some
Vice gratifyM;. Ambition, Pride, or avarice^ make rich men knaves, and Necessity, the Poor: But to go on with this rich honest Man ,* his|
Neighbour a thriving Merchant, and whose Ho-
acsty had as untainted a character, as he can
pretend(  
 
second, and make a Composition: -Our rich benest Man flies out upon him presently, he is a
Knave, a Rogue, and don?t pay People what he
owes them; and we should have a Law, that he that runs into Debt farther than he is able to
pay? should be hang'd; and the like. If the poor
man is laid Hold pn by some Creditor, and put
in Prison; ay, there let him lye, he deserves it;
'twill be an Example to keep others from the
like; and now when all is done, this broken Mer-
chant may be as honest a Man as the other.
You fay, you are an honest Man, How do you
know it? Did you ever want Bread, and had
you Neighbour's Loaf in your Keeping, and
would starve rather than eat it: ? Was you ever ar-
rested, and being not able by your self or Friends,
to make Peace with your Plaintiff, and at the
fame Time having another Man's Money in your
Calh Chest, committed to your Keeping, suffer'd
your felt to be earry'd to Jayl, rather than break
Bulk, and break in upon your Trust* God him-
self has declared, That the Power of Extremity
is irresistible, and that so, as to our Integrity,
that he' has bjxlus not despise the Thief that steals
in such a Cafe; not that the Man is less a Thief,
or the fact less dishonest: but the Text is most
remarkably e for Instruction, in this Point i
Don't you despise the Man; But remember, it
you were driven to the same Exigence, you would
be the same man, and do the same Thing, tho*
now you fancy your Principle so good,* therefore,
whatever his Crime may be as to God, don't re-
proach him with it here; but you that think you
^and, take heed, least you fall.
D 4
I ata
I am of the Qpipiotj, that I could st^te a Cir-
cumstance, in which there is not one Man in the
World would be honest: Necessity is above the
power of human Nature; and for Providence
to suffer a Man to .fall into that. Necessity, is to
suffer him to fin; because Nature is not furnifhM
with Power to defend it self, nor is Grace itself
able to fortify the Mind against it.
- What'shall we say to fiv^ Men in'a Boat at Sea,
without Provision, calling a council together,
and resolving to kill one of themselves for the
others to feed on, and eat him? With what Fac6
could the four look up,, and crave a Blessing oil
that Meat? With what Heart give Thanks after
it? And yet this has been done by honest Men;
and I .believe, the b honestest Man in the WorkJ
might be forc'd to it j yet here is no manner orPretence, but Necessity, to' palliate the Crime,
If it be argued 'twas the Loss of one Man tp
save the Four, 'tis answered, But what authority to make him die to save their Lives? How came
the Man to owe them such a Debt? was Rob, bery and Murder 9zw$s robbing him of his Life,
which was his, Property to preserve mine; *tis
Murder, by taking away the Life of an innocent
man; and at best'twas doing £vil that Good may come, which is expressly forbidden.;:
,, But there is a Kind of Equity pleaded in this
cafe ; generally when Men are brought to such a,
tass, they cast Lots, who shall be, the Man, and
the voluntary Consent of the Party makes it law-
ful (God himself being supposed to determine who
ihall be the Man) which I deny for it is in no
ManV Power legally to consent to such a Lot;
§o Man has a Right to, give away hisown Life;
he may forfeit it to the Law, and loose it; but
that's a Crime ^against himself, as well as against
iui, , I ii* _ > : , . . the
r
the Law; and the four Men might by our Law have
been try'd and Hang'd forJVTurder. All that can be
laid is, That Necessity makes the highest Crimes
lawful, and Things Evil in their own Nature are
made practicable by it. From these Extremes
of Necessity, we come to lighter Degrees of it;
and so let us bring our honest Man to Rome Exieng-
cies. He would not wrong any man of a Farthing;
he could not sleep if he should be in any body's
Debt ; and he cannot be an honest Man that can*
That we may fee now, whether this Man's
Honesty lyes any deeper than his Neighbour's,
turn the Scale of his Fortune a little: His
Father left him a good Estate, but here comes
some Relations, and they trump up a Title to his
Lands, and serve Ejectments upon his Tenants;
and so the Man gets into Trouble, Hurry of
Business, and the Law: The extravagant Charges
of the Law sink him of all his ready Money, and
his Rents being stopp'd, the first Breach he makes
upon his Honesty (that isy by his former Rules) he
goes to a Friend to borrow Money, tells him this
Matter will be over he hopes quickly, and he
shall have his Rents to receive, and then he will
pay him again; and really he intends to do so:
But here comes a Disappointment, the Tryal
comes on, and he is cast, and his Title to the
Estate proves defective; his Father was cheated,
and he not only loses the Estate, but is call'd up-
on for the Arrears of the Rent he has received;
and in short, the Man is undone, and has not a
Penny to buy Bread, or help himself; and besides,
this cannot pay the Money he borrowed.
Now, turn to his Neighbour, the Merchant,
whom he had so loudly called Knave, for Breaking
in his trade,' he by this Time has made up with
his Creditors, and got Abroad again; and he meets
'' a*' ;* * him
['4*1
him in the Street in his dejected Circumstances
We(l> fays the Merchant, and whydon't youpay>
my Cousin, your old Neighbour, the moneyyou borrow
ed of him? Truly, fays he, because I have lost all my
Estate* and can'tpay, nay I have nothing to live 6ti.
Welly but, returns the Metcbznt,Wan tyou a knaveto borrow money,and now can'tpay it? Why truly,
fays the Gentleman, When I borrowed it, I really
de/ign'd to be honest, and did not question but I shouldhave my Estate again, and then I had been able also,
and would have paid him to a penny,but it has trywedotherwise; and tho I would pay him, ifI had
it, yet I am not able. Well but, fays the merchant again, Did you not call me knave, tho9 Host my Estate
Abroad, by unavoidable Disasters, as you have lost
yours at Home? Did you not upbraid me, because I
could not pay? I would have paid every Body, if Icould, as we'll as you. Why truly, fays the Gentle-
man, I was a Fool, I did not consider what it. was
to be brought to Necessity, I ask yourPardon.
Now, let's carry on this Story: The Mer-
chant compounds with his Creditors, and paying
every one a just Proportion, as far as 'twill go,
gets himself discharged; and being bred to Busi-
ness, and industrious, falls into Trade again, and
raises himself to good Circumstances; and at last,
a lucky Voyage, or some Hit of Trade, sets him
above the world. again :. The Man remembring
his former debts, and retaining his Principle
of Honesty, calls his old Creditors together; and
tho' he was formerly discharg'd from them all, vo-
luntarily pays them the remainder of their Debts,
The Gentleman being bred to no business, and
his Fortune desperate, goes abroad, and gets in-
to the Army, and behaving himself well, is made
an Officer,* and-still rising by his Merit, becomes
a great Man, but in his new Condition troubles
, not
t his head with his former Debts in his native
(country, but settles in the Court and Favour ofthe Prince, under whom he has made his Fortunes,
and there sets up for the fame honest Man he did
before.
I think I need not ask which pf these two arethe honest Man, any more than which was the
honest Penitent, the Pharisee or the Publican.
Honesty, like friendship, is try'd in affliction; and he that cries out loudest against those who it*
the Time of this Try al are forced to give Ground,
would perhaps yield as far in the like Shock of Misfortune.
To be honest when Peace and Plenty flows
upon our Hands, is owing *ro the Blessing of our
Parents; but to be honest, when Circumstances
- grow narrow, Relations turbulent and quarrel-
some, when Poverty stares at us, and the World
threatens; this Blessing is from Heaven, and can
only be supported from thence. God Al-
mighty is very little beholding to them, who will
serve him just as long as he feeds them. 'Twas
/ a strong Argument the Devil used in that Dia-
logue between Sathan and his Maker about JoL
yeshe is 4 mighty good Man, and a mighty just
man,and wellhe may, while you give him every Thing
he wants: Iwouldserve you my self, and be as true
pyou m Job, if you wouldbeas kind and as boun-
tiful to me, as you are to him: But nowy do but lay
your Finger on him; dp but stop your Hand a little, and
cut him short; strip hima little, and make him like
oneof those poor fellowsthat now bow <to him, and you
will quickly feelyour good Man be like other men; nay\
the passionhe will be in at his Losses^ will make him
curse you to your Face. 'Tis true, the Devil was
mistaken in the Man, but the argument' had a
great deal of probability in it^and the Moral may
be drawn, both from th<? Argument and from the
Consequences.,
sj I That 5tis an easy thing to maintain the Cha-
racter of Honesty, and Uprightness, when a'Man
has no business to be in employed in, and no Want
to press him.
II. That when Exigences and Distresses pinch
a Man, then is the Time to prove the Hoiifsty of
his principle. The prosperous honest Man can only by bla-
sting tell the World he is honest,. but the distressed
and ruin'd honest M#n hears other People tell
him he is honest. .
In this Cafe therefore,, since Allowance must
be made for human Infirmities, we are to di-
stinguish between an Accident and a practice. I
am not pleadrng to encourage any Man to make
•no Scruple of trespassing upon his Honesty in Time
of Necessity: But I cannot condemn every man for a Knave, who by unusual Pressures, Straits,
Difficulties, or other Temptation," has been left
to slip, and do an ill action, as we call it,
which perhaps this Person would never have
stooped to, if the Exigence had not been too
great for his Resolution. The Scripture says of
David, He was a Man after God's OwnHeart; and
yet we have several Things recorded of him,
which, according the modern Way of censuring
People in this Age, would have given him the
Character of a very ill Man: But I conceive, the
Testimony of David's Uprightness, given us so
'authenticity from the Scripture, is given from
this very Rule, That theJsiclination of his HEART^ and the general Bent of his practice, was t^^^;
and obey his Great Sovereign Benefactor, BdW-
ever,
ever, human frailty, back'd with Extremities of
Circumstances or powerful Temptations, might
betray him, to, commit Actions which he would'
not otherwise have done. The Falling in to a Crime,
will not denominate a -man dishonest -> for hutna*
hum 'eft err are. The Character of a Man ought
to betaken from the general Tenour of his Be-
haviour, and from his allowed Practice, David
took the Shew-Bread from the Priests, which it
was not lawful for him to eat. David knew, that
God, 'who commanded the Shew-Bread should not
be eaten, had ho wever commanded him by the Law
of Nature, not to be starved and therefore, press'd
by his Hunger,he ventures upon the Commandment.
And the Scripture is very remarkable in expressing it,
David when he was an hungry: And the Occasion for which our Blessed Lord himself quoted this Text,
is very remarkable, viz,, to prove, that Things
otherwise unlawful, may be made lawful by Ne-:
ceffity, Matth. xii. 4.
Another Time, David in his Passion resolves
the Destruction of Nab al and all his Family,
which, without Doubt, was a great Sin; and
the Principle which he went upon, to wit, Re-
venge for his churlish and saucy Answer to him,
was still a greater Sin ; but the temptation backed
by the Strength ofhis Passion, had the better of him
at that Time: And this upright honest Man had
murder'd' Nabal and all his House, if God had
not prevented him.
Many instances of like Nature the Scripture
has left upon Record, giving Testimony to the
character of good Men, from the general practice and bent of their Hearts, without leaving* any
reproach upon them for particular Failings, tho9
those Sins have been extraordinary provoking, and
in their Circumstances scandalous enough.
If any Man would be so weak as from hen&S
to draw Encouragement to allow himself in easy
Trespasses upon his Honesty, on the Pretence, of
Necessities, let him go on With me to the fuir-
tfcer End of this Observation, and fihd foord fdr
it if he can.
If ever the honest Man I speak of, by what-
Ibever Exigence or Weakness, thus slips from the
Principle of his Integrity, he never fails to ex-
press his own Dislike of it; he acknowledges up-
all Occasions, both to Gbd aftd to Man; his
having been overcome^ and been prevails upon
to do, what he does not approve of; he is too*
much afhafn'd of his own Infirmity, to pretend
to vindicate the Action,^ and he certainly is re-
stored to the first Regulation of his Principles, a$
soon as the Temptation is over. No Man is
fonder to accuse him than he is to accuse himself
and he has always upon him the sincere Marks
of a Penitent.
*Tis plain from hence, that the Principle of
the Man's Integrity, is not destrby'd; hbwevef;
he may have fallen,- tho* seven tirfies a Day \
and I must while I live reckon him for an honest
Man.
Nor ain I going about to suppose, that the Ex-
tremities and Exigencies which have pressed Men!
of the best Principles, to do what at another time
they would not do, make those Actions become
less Sinful, either in their own Nature or Circum-
stances. The Guilt of a Crime tfith respect to
its being a Crime, viz*, an Offence against God, is
not removed by the Circumstances 6f Necessity.
It is without Doubt a Sin for me to steal ano-
ther Man's Food, tho* it was to supply Starving
Nature ; for how do I know whether he whofe
Food I steal may hot be in as much Danger of
Starving
starving for want of it* as I; and if not; icis taking
to my own Use what I have no Right to, and
taking it by Force or Fraud ,• and the question is not at to the Right or Wrong, whether I have
a Necessity to eat this Man's Bread or no; but
whether it be his or my own? If it be his, and
not my own, I cannot do it without a manifest
Contempt of God's Law, and breaking the
Eighth Article of it, Thou shalt not Steal. Thus as to God, the Grime is evident, let the Necessity
be what it will. .
But when we are considering human nature subjected by the Consequences of Adam'sTrans-
gression, to Frailty and infirmity ; and regarding
things from Man to Man, the Exigencies and Ex-
tremities of itreightned Circumstances seem to
me to be most prevailing Arguments^ why the
Denomination of a Man's general character ought
not, by his fellowmortals(subj eft to the fame
infirmities). to be gathered from his mistakes, his
Errors or Failings, ao not from his being guilty
of any extraordinary Sin, but from the Manner
and Method of his Behaviour. Does he go on
to commit Frauds, and make a practice of his
Sin? Is it a Distress? Is it a Storm of afflictions and Poverty has driven him upon the Lee Shore
of Temptation? Or is the Sin the Port he steer'd
for ? A Ship may by Stress of Weather be driven
upon Sands and dangerous Places, and the Skill
of the Pilot not ,be blameable,- but he that runs
against the Wind, and without any Necessity*
Mpon a Shelve which he fees before him, must do
do it on purpose to destroy the Vessel, and mine
the Voyage.
In short, if tio man can be call'd honest, but
he who is never overcome, to fall into any Breach
of this rectitude of Life; none but he who
is
is sufficiently fortified against all possibility of
being tempted by prospects, or driven by Distress,
to make any Trespass upon his Integrity; Woe be
unto me that Write, and to most that Read, where
shall we find the honest Man?
The Scripture is particularly expressive of this
in the .. . "The Righteous Manfalhth seilm times
&a Day, and rifeth again. Why, this is very strange,
*i.f a Man come, to commit seven Crimes in a Day,
\hat is, many, for the Meaning is Indefinite, can
this bean honest Man?: What fays the World of
him? Hang him, he is a knave, a Rascal, a Dis-
honest Fellow; this is the Judgment of men : But
in the judgment of Scripture this may be a
Righteous Man.
The main Design, of this Head and the proper
Application of it is, to tell us we ought not be
too hasty to Brand our Brother for his sins, his infirmities or Misfortunes, snce he that is Dis-
honest in your Eyes, by a casual or other, Crime
which he Commits, may rife from that Disaster
by a sincere Repentance, and be to morrow an
t honester Man than thy self in the Eyes of his
Maker.
. Bur here I am assaulted with another censo-
rious honest Man; here you talk of falling to
day, and rising again to Morrow-, Sinning and repenting; why there is a Fellow has cheated me
of 500 /. and he comes canting to me of his ' Re-
pentance, tells me he hopes God has forgiven
him; and it would be hard for me to call to Re-
membrance what God has wip'd out ,• he is
heartily sorry for the Fault, and the like, and
begs my Pardon, that is, begs my Estate indeed i
For what's all, this to my Money, l^t him pay me
and I'll forgive him too ,* God may forgive him
the sin, but that's nothing to my debt. WhyWhy truly, in Answer to this in Pats* ybtt are
in the Right if the Man be able to make you any
Satisfaction,, and does not do it; for I question
not, but every Trespass of this Nature requires
Restitution, as well as Repentance; Restitution as
far as the possible Power of the Party extends rand if the last be not found, the first is not likely to
be sincere. But if the man, either is not able to make you
any Restitution at all, or does make you Restituti-
on to the utmost of his Capacity, and then comes
and fays as before ,• then the Poor Man is in
the right, and you in the Wrong; for I make no
question likewise to affirm* and could prove it by
unanswerable arguments, He may be an Honest Man
who cannot pay his Debts > but he cannot be an Honest
Man who can, and does not.
Innumerable Accidents reduce Men from Plen-
tiful Fortunes to mean and low Circumstances;
some procured by their own Vices and Intempe-
rance, some by Infirmities, Ignorance, and meet
want of Judgment to manage their affairs :
Some by the Frauds and Cheats of other Men, some by meer, Casualty and unavoidable Acci-
dents, wherein the Sovereignty of Providence
lhews us, that the Race is not to the Swift, or
the battle to the strong, or Riches to Men of
Understanding.
First, Some by Vices and Intemperance are re-
duced to Poverty and Distress: Our HojieftMati
cannot fall in the Misfortunes of this Classy be cause there the very Poverty is a Sin, being product
from a sinful Cause. As its far from being al-'
low'd, as an Excuse to a Murtherer,, to fay he
was in Drink, because it is excusing a Crime
with a Crime: So for a Man to ruin his Fore tunes, as the Prodigal in the Gospel, with riot-
ous Living,,all the effects, are wicked,and dis honest, as they partake of the t)islionesty of the Cause from whence they proceed: For he cannot
be an honest Man, who wants wherewith to pay
his debts, after having spent what should have discharged them, in luxury and Debauches.
t Secondly, Some by ignorance and want of Judg-
ment to manage their Affairs, are brought to' Poverty and Distress, ,* these may be honest Men, notwithstanding their weakness, for I won't un-
dertake that none of our honest Men shall be
Fools: 'Tis true the good Man, is the wife Man*
&s to the main Part of Wisdom, which is in-
cluded, in his Piety, but many a Religious Man
who would not do any Wrong wilfully to his
ISfeighbour,, is obliged at last to injure both his
own family, and other People s, for want, of Dis
cretion to guide him in his Affairs, and to fudge for
himself: and therefore I dare not tax all our
ts with being Knaves, nor will I fay but such &
Man may be Honest. Some will say, but such
a Man should not venture into business, which he
js not able to manage, and therefore 'twas the
Vice of his Understanding, and like the Cafe in
the, first Article, is excusing a Fault with a
Fault.
I cannot allow this, for if I am askt why a
Fool ventures into Trade, I answer, because he
is a Fool, not because he is a knave. If Fools could their own* Ignorance- discern*
*They9d be no longer Fools > because they d learn.
If you would convince a Man that he wants
Discretion, you must give him discretion to be
CQtivinc'd: i ill then he cannot know he has it
&et> because he has it not. No Man is answerable,
either.
in ]
either to God or Man, for that which he never
was Master of; The most proper Expression
that ever I tnet with in this Nature, was of a
, teertain Ideot or natural, which a Gentleman
."of my Acquaintance kept in his Family, who
. being on his Death-Bed, was observed to be very
offensive, and much concerns about dying; the
Gentleman sent-a Minister to him, who as well
as he could to his Understanding, discoursed with
him about Death and Judgment to come; the
poor Creature who was hardly ever able to give
a rational answer to a question before, after
hearing him very attentively, broke out into
tears with thisExpreflion, lhat he hoped Godwouldnot require any thingof him, that he had not given
"him Judgment to understand. Whatever it may be
as to the Soul, lam positive in the Cafe of human
Affairs, no Man is answerable to Man for any
more than his Discretion; Events are not in our
Power, a Man may be nicely Honest in Life, tho' he may be weak enough in Judgment.
Thirdly,Some are ruin'd, and are yet merely
passive, being either defrauded and cheated by
Knaves, or plundered and rifled by Thieves, or
;by immediate casualties, as Fire, Enemies, Storms,
Floods and the like; these are Things which nei-
thet touch the Man s Honesty, nor his Discre-
tion, Thus Job was by God's Permission and
the Agency of the Devil, - reduced is a Moment
from a plentiful Estate to be as naked as he
came out of his Mother's Womb: I would fain
ask those who say, no Man can be an honest
Man if he does not pay his Debts, who paid
g>£s Debts if he own'd any, and where was his
iflionesty, if he did not pay them ?I still rea-
dily grant that he cannot be an honest Man who
does not pay his Debts if he can/ but if other- £ z 'wife
wise, then the Words ought to be altered, and they should say,: he cannot be an honest Man
who borrows any Money, or buys any Thing up-
on his Credit, and-this cannot be true;
But since I have led myself into the Argument,
I cannot but make a small Digression concerning
People who fail in Trade : I conceive: the greatest Error of such is their Terror about Breaking, by
which they are tempted while their Credit is
good, tho' their Bottom be naught, to push far-
ther in; expecting, or at least hoping, by the Pro-
fits of some happy Voyage, orsome lucky Hit,
as they call it, to, retrieve their Circumstances,
and stand their ground. , *' , „
I, must confess, I cannot vindicate the.H.onesty
of this Jfor he, who knowing his Circumstances
to be once naught,, and < his Bottom worn out >
ought not in justice to, enter into any Man's Debt;
for Then he Trades on their Risque, not on his
own, and yet Trades for his own Profits, not
theirs; this is not fair, because he deceives the
Creditor, who ventures his Estate on that Bot-
tom which he supposes to be good, and the o-
ther knows is not. Nay, tho' he really pays
this Creditor, he is not honest; for in Consci-
ence, his former Creditors, had a Right to all
his effects, in Proportion to their Debts,- and if
he really pays one all, and the rest but. a Share*
9tis a wrong to the whole.
I would therefore advise all Tradesmen, who
find, their Circumstances declining, asusoon, at
least, as they first discern themselves to be.unca-
pable of paying their Debts, if not, while , yet
they can pay every one, all, make a full Stop,
and call all People together; if there is enough
to pay them all, let them have, it, if not* let
them have their just Shares of it;. by this means , you
you "will certainly have God's Blessing, and the
Character of an honest Man, left to begin again
with ; and Creditors are often prevailed with, in
Consideration; of such a-generous Honesty, to
throw ba<& something to put such a Man in a
posture to live again; or by further voluntary Cre-
dit and Friendship, to uphold him. This is much
better also with respect to interest, as well as Amnesty than' to run on to . all Extremities, till the
Burthen-fags ' too heavy,* either for Debtor or
Creditor, to bear : Thfs would prevent many of
the 'Extremities, whichr I fay, puts the Honesty
of a man' s fo extraordinary a Tryal.
I :An honest Principle would certainly dictate to
the Man, if it > were consulted with, that, when
:Ke knows he is not able to> pay,. it is not lawful
for him- to borrow. Taking Credit is a'Promise
of Payments a Promised Payment, is tacitly
understood, and he cannot be honest who promises
what he knows he cannot perform, as I > shall
»ote en large on another Head. But if .the
Man be paid, yet it' was vnofc an honest Act;
;?twasdeceivifig^the Man, and"shaking.him!run a
greater Risque than he knew of, ;and suchaRisquQ
as he would not have run, had he known your
Circumstances and bottom, as*you do; so that
here is Deceit upon Deceit.
This I know is a disptited point, and a Thing
:which a great many practice s very ho-
nest Men in the World; but I like it not the better
for that; I am very positive, that he who takes
"my goods on the Foot of his Credit, when if
he should dye the next Day, he knows his Estate
will not pay me five Shillings in the Pound;
tho? ht should not dye, but^dc^s pay me at the
time appointed, is as much guilty of a Fraud,
as if f actually rofeb'd my House. Credit is a
E j ^ received
.CM]
received Opinion of jl Man's Honesty and Abili-
ty, his willingness to pay, and his having where-
with to pay; and he who wants either of these,
his Credit is lame. Men won't fell their goods to a litigious quarrelsome Man, tho* he be never
so rich, nor to a needy Man, tho' he be never
so honest. Now, if all 'the World believe I
am honest and able, and I know I am not the
last, I cannot be the first, if I take their goods upon Credit; 'tis vain to pretend, Men Trade;
iy>ost the general Risque of Mens appearance, and the Credit of common fame, and all men have an equal Hazard. I say no: Men may ven-
ture their Estates in the Hands of a flourisliirtg
Bankrupt, and he by Virtue of his yet' unfliakerf
"Credit is trusted; but he cannot be honest that
takes this Credit, because he knows his Circum^
stances are quite otherwise than they are sup-
posed to be, that the Man is deceived, and he is
privy to the deceit, This Digression is notsp remote Iropi .the pur^
jpose, as I expected, when I began it the honesty that I am speaking of, chiefly respects matters, of Commerce of whch Credit and Payment of Debt are the most considerable branches. There is another Article in Trade, which many very honest men have made familiar to
themselves, which yet I think, is in no Cafe to
be defended \ and that is relating to Counterfeit
Money.'' Custom, before the old money was
fuppress'-d in England, had prevails so far upon
honesty, that I have seen some men put all their: fBrass money among their runing Cash, to be told
over in" every Sum they paid, in order to have
somebody or other take *it; I have heard many
People own they" made no scruple of it, but I
could never find them give one good Reason to
justify the Honesty of its * L First-,
First,They say it comes for Money, and it
aught tp go so: To which I answer, that is
just as good a Reason as this: A has cheated me,
^nd therefore I may Cheat B. If I have receiv-
ed a Sum of Money for good, and knowing not
that any of it is otherwise, offer it in Payment to
tam)ti?5r: This is Just and Honest; but, if on this
other Man's telling it over, he returns me a Piece
:if Brass or Counterfeit Money which I change
again, and afterwards knowing this to be pr offer the same Piece to another: I know no worse
Fraud *n *tS Degree in the World, and I doubt pot to prove it so beyond Contradiction.
If the first person did not take this Piece of
Money? it was because being both watchful ancj
skilful, he could discover it; and if I offer it
£0 another 1: with an expectation, that he being
either less watchful pr less skillful, shall overlook
lt} and Co I shall make an advantage of my
Neighbour's Ignorance, or want of Care.
Pil put -some parallel Cafes to this, to illustrate
it: Suppose a blind man comes into a shop to buy goods of me, and giving me a Guinea tp
change, I shall give him the remainder in bad Mo-,
^ey; wpuld not every Ifcdy fay 'twas a barbarous
thing ? Why the other is all one, for if the Person
be ignorant of Money, he is blind as to the point in Hand; and nothing can be more unfair 'than.
Co take the advantage. ,
Suppose again a young Boy, or a Servant new-
ly entered in trade, is sent to buy Goods, and
by his Master's Order, he asks for such a Com-
modity; and you presuming upon the rawness of the Messenger, deliver a Sort of a meaner
quality, and cake the full Price of him; wo6l4
you grudge to be used se'urvily for such a trick ?
^hy, no less or better is Osterkg Brass for Silver,
'c 56 ]
presuming only the want of care or Skill in the
Receiver, shall pass it unobserv'd.
.Ay, but says a learned Tradesman who would be thought honester than ordinary; Ialways change
it again, if it be brought back : Yes~Sir, so does a
Pick-Pocket give you your Handkerchief , again
when you have fastens on him, and threatens himwith the Mob. The Matter in short is this; if
the Man whom you have cheated, can cheat no
Body else, then "no Thanks to, you; When he
comes to you, and charges the Fraud upon you,
you'll make Satisfaction, because if you won't,
the law will compel you to it.
But if the Fraud may be carried on, as you
are manifestly willing, consenting, and instrumen-
tal in it that it should; behold the Consequence,
you* first sin against Honesty is multiplied in all
the. Hands thro ugh this Piece of bad Money
knowingly so passes, till at last it happens to go
sihgle' to a poor , Man that can't put it off, and
the wrong and injury may issue where it was
wanted to buy bread for £ starving family. AU,jtheExcuses, I could ever meet with could
never satisfy me, that it can consist with Honesty,

Of Honesty in Promises.
Man is known by his Word, and an Ox h
his Hornsy fays an old EnglishProverb.
If I understand the true Meaning of it,
>tis>that theHonesty of 2 Man is known by his punctual observing his Word, as naturally
and plainly as any Creature is known by the
most obvious Distinction, "Tis the peculiar
Quality of an honest Man, the distinguishing
Mark to know him by. His Word or Promise is
as sacred to him in all his Affairs in the world' s the strongest obligation which can be laid on
him; nor is it a Thing formed by him from fet-
tled Resolutions, or Measures of Policy takqn
up of course to raise or fix his Reputation; but
*cis the native Produce of his honest Principle:
"Tis the Consequence, and his Honesty is the
Cause; he ceases to be? Honest, when he ceases
to preserve this solemn Regard to his Word.
If he gives his Word, any Man may depend
upon it, for the Safety ofhis Life or Estate y he
scorns to prevaricate or shift himself off from th&
punctual Observance of it, tho' it be to his Lois. * I can't abate an honest Man an Inch in the pun-
ctual Observance of a Promise made upon parole if it be . in the Man's possible Power to perform
It, because there seems to be something too basp
to consist; with Honesty in the very Nature of a
Man that can go back from his Word.

dal upon the Affront of giving the Lie; a Gentlf*
man* which is, in fliOTt/^e^aod^rn Term for ^

a greater reproach, than to be told, he's; that
is, that he forfeits his Word, breaks hjs Vetacir

himself, disgraces the blood "of his family, dp-
generates from his Aircestorsj and fommepce$
Ra,k£, Scoundrel, and any Thipg.
Some people, who have run their Pointsof Ho-
nour to the Extreams, are of the opinion, that this affront of the Lie ought not to be given to
any thing -they call a Gentleman, or that calls himself so,. till he has so far exposed himself to
all other Degrees of Infamy, as to be#r Kicking,
or caning, and, the like; that after this, when he
breaks his Word, he may fee told, he lies, or any
thing else ; but till then, the very Thing it self
is ib intolerable an, Abuse, that the Person who ventures to trespass .so foully on the Rules of good Manners, deserves not the Honour of fair Play

Such was the Value put upon the Promises of
Men in former time, that a Promise o,f payment of money was recoverable in our Courts by law, till the Jnconveniencies provM so niany, that an
Act was made on Purpose to restrain it to a Sum

promises Marriage to a Woman, especially if she
has granted him any Favours upon that Condition,
the Laws of the Land, which therein have Re-
gard to the Laws of Honour, will oblige him to
make it good, and allow it to be a sufficient Plea
to forbid his marrying with any body else.
There are innumerable instances of the Vene-

own Integrity is untainted, and would abide all
the Tryals and Racks, that a ruin'd Fortune,
strong Temptations, and deep Distresses, could
T bring it into: Let them not boast till these Dan-
gers are past, and they put their Armour off; and
if they can do it then, I will freely acknowledge,
they have less need of Repentance than I.
Not that I pretend, as I noted before, and
fcall often repeat, that these Circumstances ren-
der my Failing, or. any Man's else, the less a Sin,
but
but they make the keasoti,. Why we that have fallen, should rather be pity'd than repiroaeh'd by
those who think they stand; because, when the
same Assaults are made upon the chastity of
their Honotor^ it may be every jot as likely to be prostituted as their Neighbours.
and fuels is the Folly of scandal as well as
the Blindness of Malice, that it seldom fixes Re-
proach upon the Right Foot: I have seen over much
of it, with respect to other people, as well
as my self, that it gives me a very scoundrel Opi-
nion of all those people whom I find forward to
load their Neighbours with reproach; Nothing
is more frequent in this cafe, than ,to run away
with a Piece of a Mans, Character* in which
they err* and didhim wrong > and l^ave that Part
of him untouched which is really black, and
would bear it; this makes me sometifries*
. "when . with the humblest and most abasing
Thoughts of my self, I look up, and betwixt
God and my own soul cry out, What a wretcham, I! at the fame time smile at the hair-brain'd
Enemy, whose Tongue tipt with Malice, runsa-
head of his Understanding* and miffing the Crimes
for which I deserve more than he can inflict, re-
proaches me with those I never committed. Me-
thinks I am ready to call him back, like the
huntsman, when the dogs run upon the Foil, and
fay, hold, hold, your are wrong; take him here> v
and you have him.
I question not but *tis the fame with other Peo-
ple > for when Malice is in the Heart, Reproach
generally goes a Mile before Consideration, and
where is the honesty of the Man all this while?
This is trampling upon my Pride, fed majo~
rifaftu; but with greater Pride; 'tis exposing my
Dishonesty, but with the highest Knavery j *tis.
Method nb hbnest Man will take, arid $h&i
taken, no honest Man regards; wherefore, let
none of these Sons of Slander take Satisfaction in the
frequent Acknowledgments lam always ready to
make of my own failing, for that Humility with
which I always .find Cause to look into my own
Heart^where I see others worses and more guilty of
Crimes than they can lay to my Charge, yet makes
me look back upon their weakness with the last
Contempt, who fix their impotent Charges where
there is not Room to take hold, and run away
with the; Air, and Shadow of Crimes never com-
mitted.
I have instane'd this, not at all on my own
Account, for 'tis not worth while; for if I am
injured, what's that to troubling the World with,
when I am forgotten; but while I am examin-
ing the nicest Article in the World, Honesty», I can-
not but lay down these three Heads from the pre-
ceding Observations.
i. He who is forward to reproach the infirmitiesof other Mens Honesty„ is very near a Breach of
his own.
$i He that hastily reproaches another without suffi-
cient Ground, cannot be an honest Man.
3. Where there may be sufficient Ground of Reproach,
yet an honest Man is always tender of his Neigh-
hours characterfrom the senseof his own
frailty.But I return to Honesty, as it affects a Man's
pledging his Word, which is the Counter-part of
his Principle, and this because as I said, I should
chiefly regard this Honesty, as it concerns human
'A#airs Conversation,, and Negotiation;
And
And here I meet with a Tradesman come just in from dunning one of his Neighbours i
Well, I have been at a Place for, Money,says he, but
lean get hone; there's such a one, he passes for an
honest man, but I am sure he is a great Rogue to
me, for he has promised me my money a long
Time, but puts me off still from Time to Time
he makes no more of breaking his Word, than
of drinking a Glass of Beer. I am fuse he has
told me forty Lies already ,• this is one of your honest Men, if all such honest Men were hang a we
should have a better Trade ,* and thus$ he runs on.
'If ail such honest Men were hang'd, they that
were left might have a better Trade, but how
many of them would there be?
Now tho' I shall no Way vindicate Metis hasty
Promises absolutely to perform what is doubtful
in the Event, yet I cannot agree, that every man who having prpmis'd a Payment, does nbt pet" form it, to his Time, is a Knave Ora Lyar; if it
were so,, the Lord have Mercy upon three Parts
of the City.
Wherefore, to state this Matter clearly, it must
be taken a little to Pieces, and the Articles spo-
ken to apart.
First, Without Question, when a Man makes a
promise of Payment to another on a set Day, know-
ing in his own Thoughts that it is not probable he
should be capable to comply with it, of-really
designing not to comply with it, or not endea*
vouring to comply with it: 'Tis a Deceit put
upon the Party, 'tis a premeditated formal Lye^
the Man that made it is a Stranger to Honesty*
he is a Knave, and every Thing that is base and
bad. But
Secondly, Promises ought to be understood both
by the Person to whom, and the Person by whom,
they
they are made as liable to those Contingencies
that all human Affairs and persons are liable top as Death, Accidents, Disappointments, and Dis-
order: Thus, if a Man, who ought to pay me
to Day, tells me, Sir, I cannot comply with you
to Day, but if you call for it next Week, you shall
have it.
If I may put this Answer into plainerEnglish; and
I suppose the Man to be an honest Man; I cannot
understand his Meaning otherwise than thus:
"Sir, I acknowledge your Money is due;
<c I have not Cash enough by me to pay you to
u Day; but I have several running Bills, and se-
c< veral Persons who have promised me money* t( which I doubt not I shall receive against such a
€C Time; and if you call then, I make no Que-
cc stion, but I fliall be able to do it; and if it is
Ct possible for me to pay you, I will do it at that
"Time, without Fail.
I confess, it were as well to express themselves
thus at large, in all the Appointments People make
for payment; and would the Persons who make
them consider it, they would do so: But Custom
has prevails in our general Way of Speaking,
whereby all Things that are subject to the com-
tnon known contingents of Life, or visible in the
Circumstances of the Cafe, are understood without
being expressed. For Example:
I make an appointment of meeting a Man po-
sitively at such a Town, such a certain Day or
Hour; if I were talking to a Turk or a Pagan that
knows nothing, or believes nothing, of Supreme
Providence; I would fay, If the Lord of Heaven
and Earth that governs all my ABionsy please to pe+
serve and permit me: But when I am talking to as
Christian, it should seem to be so universally sup-
Posed, that every appointment is subjected, and

this breach of his word, must have^been/un^

If then the Cafe is so nice, tho' in the Strict-
ness of Speaking, such a Disappointment may
oblige an honest Man to break his Word; yet
every honest Man, who would preserve that Cha-
racter to himself, ought to be the more wary, and
industriously avoid making such absolute uncon-
ditional Promises, because we are to avoid the
Circumstances of Offence.
But as to the Nature of the Thing, 'tis plain to
me, that a Man may in such Cafes be obliged to
break his Word unwillingly and nothing can be
a Fraud or dishonest action in that Cafe, which is
not either voluntary in it self, or the Occasion
voluntarily procur'd.
Of Relative Honesty.
IS
S Honesty is simple and plain, with*
out Gloss and Pretence, so *ti$ univer-
k sal: He that may uphold an untainted
« , „, „ I Reputation in one Particular, ittay be
justly.branded with infamy in another. A Man
may^ be punctual in his Dealings, and a knave in his Relations> hone'st in his Ware-house, and
a Knave at his Fire-side: He may be a Saint in
his Company, a Devil in his Family; true to his
Word, and false, to his Friendship: But whosoe-
ver he be, he is no honest Man. An honest
Man is all of a Piece, the whole Contexture of
his Life, his general conduct is genuine, and
fquar'd according to the rules of honesty ; he
never runs into extremes and excesses on one
hand or other.
I con-!
 
f confess* I find 'this thing, which they call
Relative ffinesty, very little thought of in the
World; and that which is still worse, 9ti$ very lit-
tle understood: Til bring it down to but a feff
Examples; some of whi^h frequently happen a-
mong us, $nd will therefore be thp more familiar*
ly received-.
There are relative Obligations entaiTd/bi\ qs
in our Family Circumstances, which are just
J)pbts, and must be paid; and, which, in a Word,
a Man can no jhore be honest, if he does not make
Conscience .pf Discharging, than he can in the
Case'of fheimost 'unquestionable Debts jbgtweem
$#an andean* ( ^ ,
, The Debts from CKiJdren so Parents ahei from
Wjives ;to their Husbands, $re in a Manner /re-
latively changed, and the pbligation transferred
into-the Order of religious Duties. God the
(Guideand Comm^ndpt pf all Subordination, has
as it Were, takep tfyat Part into his own Hand;
'tis rather call^ f tfuty to him, than a relative
Duty only,:, Bi?t it JVfeiuakc this for a Discharge

Principles,

declassed ,tp be so far from a Christian; that he i$
ufors$ than an Infidel that neglects it: Butv there
#re pth^r Parts of our Obligations, which Ho-
.nesty calls upon us to perform.
A Wife ai?d Children are Creditors to the Fa-
ther of the Family; and he cannot be $n horibst

run out this Part into a long Discourse on the Ne-

ly (hew'd itus by their Size* were better suited
for the Blacksmith's Sledge, or the Carpenter s
Axe, 'the Waterman's Oar, or the Carman's
Whip?
Whence comes it to pass, that we have so many
young Men brought to, the Bar, and to 'the Pul-
pit, with stammering Tongues; Hesitations, and
Impediments in their speech, unmusical voices, and no common Utterance; while on the other
Hand, Nature's Cripples, Blue bottle- ham'd, and halt-made Creatures, are bred Tum-
blers and Dancing-Masters.
I name these, because they occur most in our
common Observation, and are all miserable Ex-
amples, where the Children curse the knavery of
their Fathers, in not paying the Debt they owed to them as Parents, in putting them to Employ-
ments that had been suitable to their Capacities,
and suitable to what Nature had cut them out for.
I came into a publick House once in London,
where there was a black Maletta-look'd Man sit-
ting, talking very warmly among sot^e Gentler-
men, who I observed were listening very attentive-
ly to what he said ,* and I sat myself down, and
did the like, 'twas with great Pleasure I heard him
discourse very handsomly on several weighty Sub-
jects* I found he was a very good Scholar,
had been very handsomely bred, and that Lear Ding and Study was his Delight;.and more than that, some of the belt of Science was at that Time
his Employment: At length I took the Freedom
to ask him, If he was born in England?
He reply'd with a great deal of good Humour
in the Manner, but with an Excess of Resentment
at his Father, and with Tears in his Eyes, Yes,
yes, Sir, I am a true-born English Mm, to my
Father's shame be it spoken,,- who being an English
Man himself, could find in his Heart to join him-
self to a Negro Woman, tho' he must needs know, the Children he should beget, would curse the Me-
mory of such an action, and abhor his very Name
for the fake of it. Yes, yes, fays he, repeating
it again, I aman EnglishMan, and born in law-
ful Wedlock 5 Happy had it been for me, tho' my
father had gone to the Devil for WhbredonS,
had he lain with a Cook-Maid, or produced
me from the meanest Beggar Woman in the Street.
My Father might do the Duty of Nature to his
black Wife ,* but, God knows, he did no justice to his Children. If it had not been for this
damned black Face of mine, fays he then smiling,
I had been bred to. the Law, or brought up in the
Study of Divinity: But my Father gave me Lear-
ning to no manner of Purpose for he knew I should
never be able to rise by it taany Thing, but a
learned Valetde Chambers.What he put me to
School for, I cannot imagine t He spoiled a good

Perhaps I may be more particularly sensible of the
Benefit and of the pleasure of it, having been so
effectually mortify?d with the Want of it: But as
I take it to be one of the Peculiars of the ratio-
nal Life, that Man is a convertible Creature; so

sed'with suitable Persons about him to converse

ticulars, nothing can recommend a Man more, no-
thing renders him more agreeable, nothing can be
a better character to give of one Man to another,
next to that of his being an honest and religious
Man, than to fay of him that he is very good Com-
pany. How
 
How delightful is it to see a Man s Face al-
ways covered with smiles, and his Soul shining
continually in the Goodness of his temper ; to se$
an Air of Humour and Pleasantness sit ever upon
his Brow, and to find him on all occasions the
fame, $ver agr^e^le to, others and to himself; a
steady Calm of Mind,1 a clear Head, and serene
Thoughts always, acting the Mastership upon him:
Such a Man has something angelick in his very
Cpuntenance; t he Life of such a Mat^ is one en tire Scene of'CofoposureV W an Anticipations

This is the truly agreeable Person, and the on-
ly one that can be call'd so in the World; his Coma pany is a Charm, and is rather wonder'd at than
imitated: 3Tis almost a Vertue to envy such a
Man and one is apt innocently to grieve at him,
when we fee what is so desirable in him, and can not either find it, or make it in our selves.
But take this with you in the character of this
happy Man, namely, that he is always a good
Man, a religious Man: *Tis a gross Error to ima-

can be that Man, can have this calm, serene Soul, those clear thoughts, those constant smiles upon
his Brow, and the steady Agreeableness and Insantry in his temper, that I am speaking of; there
must be Intervals of Darkness upon such a Mind;
Storms in the Conscience will always lodge Clouds
upon the Countenance; and where the Weather
is hazey within, it can never be Sun-shine without;
the Smiles of a disturb'd Mind are all but feign'd
and forg'd; there may be a good disposition, but
it will be too often and too evidently interrupted
by the Recoils of the Mind, to leave the Tem-
per untouch'd* and the Humour free and uncon-*
any where the Drum beats an Alarm within,
it is impossible but the Disturbance will be dis-
covered without.

fail to hear his reflecting Faculty whisper a
Sigh to him; he'll (shake it off, you will see him
check it and go on; perhaps he sings it off, but
at the End of every Song, nay perhaps of every
Stanza, it returns; a kind of involuntary Sadness
breaks upon all his Joy; he perceives it, rouze<r,
despises it, and goes on; but in the Middle of a
long Laugh, in drops a Sigh it will be, it can
be no otherwise; and I never convers'd closely
with a Man of Levity in my life, but I could
perceive it most plainly 'tis a Kind of Respira-
tion,- natural to a stifl'd Conviction; a Hesitation
that is the consequence of a captivated Vertue S
a little Insurrection in the Soul against the Tyran-
ny of profligate Principles.

, A statedrexposure of ,mind can really pro-
ceed from nothing but a Fund of Vertue; and
this is the Reason why 'tis my Opinion, that the
common saying* That Contentof Mind is Hap-
piness, is a vulgar mistake, unless it Be granted,
that this content is first founded on such a basis* as the Mind.ought to be contented with; for
otherwise a Lunatick in Bedlam is a compleatly
happy man, Brie sings in his Hutch, and dan-
ces in his Chain, and is as contented as any Man
living: The Possession or power, which that Va-
pour or Delirium has upon/his Brain, makes him fancy himself a Prince, a Monarch, a statesman, or just \*{hat he pleases to be; zsk certain Dut-
ches, is said* to have believed herself to, be anEm-

twith this Splendor, her ,;distemper'd Mind is
deluded, forming Ideas of tThings which ar£

which stie is made a Property ,to other Persons, her
Estate managed by Guardianship, 'and a poor
demented Creature to the last,Degree, an Ob-
ject of human compassion, and compleatly mi-
serable. '".
The'only Contentment which entitles mankind to any Felicity, is that which is fouhded upon
Vertue and just Principles; for Contentment is
nothing more or less than what we call Peace;
and what Peace, where Crime possesses the mind* which
[79:3
which is attended, as a natural consequence, tvith
Torment and Disquiet? What Peace where the
Harmony of the Soul is broken by constant Re-
gret, and Self^Reproaches ?What peace in a mind under constant * Apprehensions, and Terrors of
something yet attending to render them misera-
ble; and all this is inseparable from a Life of Crime.
For where there's Guilt, THEREalways willbe Fear,Peace of Mind makes a Halcyon upon the Coua^
-tenance, it guilds the Face with a cheerful aspect, such as nothing else can procure; and which indeed
as above, it is impossible effectually to counter-
feit*. > . .

But I return to the Subject of Conversation; frdrii
Which this Digression is m^cpn\y to shew that
the Fund of agreeable Cbnversatioh is, ahd caft
only be founded in Virtue; this alone is the Thing
that keeps a.Man always inMumour, and always
agreeable.
They mistake much, who think Religion, or a
strict Morality, discomposes th£ Temper, sowres
-the Hindi and unfits a Man for Conversation.
Tis irrational to think, a Man can't be bright,
unless he is wicked; It may as well be said, a
Man canfrot be merry till lie is mad* not agree-
able till he is offensive, not in Humour till he is out
of himself. 'Tis clear to m£, no Man can be truly
merry > but he that is truly virtuous: Wit is as
• consistent with Religion, as Religion is with good
Manners; nor is there any Thing in the Limita-
tions of Vittue and Religipn; I means the just
/ Restraints which Religion and Virtue lay upon us
in Conversation ; that should abate the Pleasure of
'it* on the contrary they encrease it: For Example:
Restraints from vicious and indecent Discourses,
There's as little Manners in those Things, as
there is Mirth in them; • nor indeed does Re-
ligion or Virtue rob Conversation of one Grain
of true Mirth: On the Contrary, the religioi\s
Man is the only Man fully qualify d for Mirth
and good Humour with this Advantage, that
when thevitioxis and th£ virtuous Man appear gay
and merry, but differ, as they inust do, in the Subject
of their Mirth, you may always observe the virtu- * r
ous Man's'Mirth is superior to the other-, more
suitable to him, as a Man, as a Gentleman/ as a
* wise Man, and as a good Man i and generally
speaking, fhfe other will acknowledge it; at least,
afterward, ivhen his Thoughts cool> and as his
Reflections com* iji.

NATION-
Efore Ijenter *upon the Thwgi which I
call the Immorality of ^Conversation
let me say a little about the many weak and foolish Ways, by whieh men folk, as it were, to unfit themselves for .Conversation.
Human Infirmities furniflrus, with several Things that help to make Gus unconvertible j we need nor study to encrease the Disadvantages we be under
on that Score; Vice md Intemperance, not as &

they come to Years,, and observe,, whije.you live^

'M?er knew, i: It
 
It see|ps strange, that A|en ihould affect unfit-
ting themselves for society, and study to make
themselves unconversible, whereas their being
truly sociable, as Men, is the Thing which
would most recommend them, and that to the
best of Men, and best answers to the highest Fe-
licity of Life. Let no Man value himself upon
being morose and cynical, sour and unconversible,
?tis the Reverse of a good Man a truly religi-
ous Man follows the Rule of the Apostle, be Af-
fable, be courteous,be Humble:,in meekness,esteeming
every Man better than our selves; whereas Conversa-
tion now is the Reverse of the Christian Rule;
*tis interrupted with Conceitednefs and Affectati-
on, a Pride, esteeming our fehes better than every
man; and that which is worse still, this happens
generally, when indeed,the Justice of the Cafe is
against us 5 for . where is the Man who thus over-
ruling himself, is not evidently inferiour in Merit
to all about him? Nay, and frequently those
who put most Value upon themselves, have the
least Merit to support it. Self-Conceit is the
Bart; of human society, and generally speaking
is the Peculiar of those who have the least to
recommend them; 'tis the Ruin of Conversation,
and the Destruction of all Improvement; for how.
Should any Man receive any Advantage from the
Conversation 'of others, who believes himself qua-
lified to teach them, and not to have Occasion to
learn any Thing from them?
Nay, as the foot is generally the Man that is
conceited moil of his own Wit, so that very
Conceit isthe Ruin of, him; it confirms him a
J?ool ail the Days of his life, for he that thinks
himself a wise .Man, is a Fool, and knows it
not i aay, 9xi* impossible he should continue to be
G a „ aFool>

a fool, if he was but once cotlvinfi'd of hi§
Folly- t ' ^
If foolscould their K6wn Ignorance discern,
they'dbe no'longer Foohy because they'd learn] ft will be objected h<ke indeed, that; Folly and
Conceit may be hurtful to Conversation, may
rob Men of the advantage of it, unfit One Side
for Conversing, and make' it unprofitable, as well
'as unpleasant to the other ,* but that this* is nor-
thing to the Immorality of Conversation; thatlg*-
France and conceit may be an infirmity, but is
not always a crime ;' that the-Mischief of
Mens being Fools us generally their own, but
the mischief of their "being Knaves is to other
People, and this is very true. But certainly, e-
gregious Folly merits one Paragraph of rebuke; Perhaps it may totfoti the Senses of some weak
Brethren one time or other and the Labour may
not be loft.
I never h\ir a- more simple,, or yet a more fin
rioUsr irtecondleable Quarrel, d once between
two of the' most empty conceited People that e-
vcr-I knew in the World; and it was upon one
calling the other FooIy which on both'Sides was
unhappily very true; they fought upon the Spot,
but were parted by the Company j they chair
leng'd, and could not meet,* their Friends getting
Notice of it; in short, it ruined them both; they
made newAppointments, and at last deceiv'd their
friends and fought'again5 they were both woun*
ded, and one died,'the other fled the country, and never returned. The-first own'd he was a
Fool, which was indeed'fome Diminution1 of his
"folly. I fay, he knew, himself to be a^pool, but
could not bear the otfeewlhould tell him so,, who^
was-
was more a fool than himselfThe other boldly as-
serted his own Capacities tg> be infinitely greater than they were, and despised the first to the last
Degree, who indeed, it hp h&4 not more wit, had more Modesty than the other; but both like
Fools fought about Nothing, for fuck indeed the
question about their Wit, might very well have
been callM
But, it is true, after all, the Want of a con-
versible Temper, if from a Want or defect of
Sense may be an Infirmity, not an immorality *
that is to fay, the Cause is not so in itself, but
it may be so in its Consequences, that way also*
For the Conversation of Fools is vanityin the Afir aB. I might here indeed find subject for a
large Tra<% upon the infinite Diversity of Fools,
and by consequence the wondrous Beauty of their
Conversations IJiav^pn this Qccasion reckoned
up a List of about Seven and Thirty several sorts of Fools, besides Solomon s Fool,whom I take to be, the wicked Fool only; these I have diversified by
their Tempers and Humours, and in the infinite
variety' s their Follies of several Sorts, in every
one of which they rob themselves, and all that
keep them Company of the Felicity of Converr
Ration, there j^ein^ nothing in them but Empti-
ness, or a¥ulnefeof,what is ridiculous, and on-"
ly qualified to be taughtat/'pro found Fault
with*
I We' likewise cfescrifc'd some of their Con-
versation, their Vain Repetitions, their Catch-
Words, their Laughings and Gestures, and adap-
ted them j to make the World merry. I have
Thoughts^of running it on into foreign Chara-
cters, aijd describe French, Spanish, Portuguese
Fools, and Fools of Rujfia, China, and the East
ptdtesx but as this is something remote from the

[8<n
Design in Hand, which is more serious, an4
done on a much better View, and likewise of
an immeasurable Length, like the weighty Sub-
ject it is upon (for Folly is a large Field) so I re-
fer it to another Opportunity.
The Truth is, that Part pf Conversation which
I am now to speak of, or which I mean by what
I have said upon this Subject, is the weighty and
serious Part, and is not the meet common Talk,
or a Conversation which Fools are capable of;
'cis exercised in a solid and well temper'd Frame,
and when regulated as it ought to be, by Virtue,
aud good Morals, is quallified to make Mankind
happy in the Enjoyment of the best Things,
and of the best Company, and therefore, the E-
vils that creep into, and corrupt this Part of our
Conversation, are of the more fatal Quality, arrd
worth our exposing, that People may see an4
fliun them, and that Conversation may be restored
among u$ to what it slipuld be.

Power of Words that Mankind'is'able to act, as

we hear, are most peircing and permanent; 'and
the Force of Example in this Cafe/is not more
powerful than the Force of Argument 'Some of the worst sins are not to be rommir-
*ted but by the Tongue, as the Sin of Blasphemy,
speaking Treason against the Majesty of God,
<Cursings and- Imprecations among Men, Islanders,and a vast Variety of petty Excursions,
which are grown modifli by Custom, and seem too
srf&ll to be reproved.
* We ,are hore in England, after many Years De .generapy, arrived to a Time, wherein Vice is m
general' difcoiwtenanc'd by Authority God i®
Mercy to the Age has inspired our Government
with a Rotation to discourage it: The King
now, his wars are over, and his foreign Enemies
#allow hifu fomp Rest, will, we hope, declare war against this Domestick* Enemy.
'The late Queen Mary,of heavenly Memory, fat?

Time gallantly in the Cause of Virtue: Magi-
strates were' ^eo#ra[fd to no vice, new
laws made to restrain it, and Justice seemed t<>

To make Laws against Words, would be as;
shitless as to make a shelter against the Lightning;
there- are.. so many Inlets to the Breach, thatrthq
Informers would be as numerous as the Crimi-
nals, and the Trespass as frequent as, th$ Minutes
we live in,
Conversation ha§ received a general taint, and
the Disease is become a Charm ; the Way to cure
it, is not by forcible Restraints on' Particulars,
but by some general influence qn the publick Pra-
ctice; whep a Diftemper becomes pleasant to a
Patient, he is the harder to be cut') ; he has a fort
of Aversion to th^ Remedy because he has none to
the Disease. Our modern People have such a Pas-
|ion -for the Mode, that if it be but the Fashion
to be Lewd3 they will scandalize their Honour* de-
bauch their Bodies, and damn their Souls to be
Gentile; if the Beaux talk piasphemy, the rest will
set up for AtRiests, and deny their Maker, to b^
counted witty in the Defence of it ,* when our
Tradesmen would.be thought wise, and makes themselves appear mice and learned in their Con-
versation, nothing will satisfy them but to criti-
cise upon Things sacredrun up to discuss the Iiv
jfcrutables of Religion; search the Arcana even of
Heaven itself; The Divinity of the Son of God,
the hypostatiqk Union, the rational Description of
the Sca.te Everlasting, nay^ the Demonstrations of
undemonstrable Things, are the £ommo,n Subject of theirv fancied affected Ca,pacities/
Hence come Heresies and Delusions, Men af-
fecting to search into what is impossible they should
clearly discover, learn to doubt, because they can-
not describe, and deny the Existence because they
cannot explain the Manner of what they enquiry
after; as if a thorow impossibility of their acting
|>y their Sense upon Objects bey ondt its, Re^ch, wa$
an Evidence against their Being. Thus because the
Trinity cannot appear to their Reasoning, they
oppose their Reasoning to its Reality they will
divest the Son of God of his Divinity, and of the
hypostatick fJnion of the Godhead in the Person
fit Christ, because they cannot distinguish between
the actions done by him in his, Mediatorial Capa-
city, in virtue of his Office, and those actions, which he did in Virtue of His omnipotence and
Godhead.
This is not an Immorality and Error in Conver-
sation only, or not so much, so as I think it is a Judg-
ment upon it, a Blast from Heaven upon the Arro-
gance of the Tongue; when proud Men give
themselves a Loose to talk Blasphemously to be
thought witty, their Maker, gives them up to. suggest danmblc Errors till they begin to believe
them, and to broach their own wicked Hints, till
they by Custom learn to espouse and defend them, as Children tell feigned Stories till they be-
lieve them to be true. If our Town Fopperies %
were visible only in the little Excursions of Dress
and Behaviour, it would be Satisfaction enough
for a wife Man, either to pity or laugh at them »
.but when Wit is set on work, and Invention racked
to find out Methods, how they may be more than
superlatively wicked, when all the Endowments of the Mind and Helps of Art, with the Accom-
plishments of Education are rang'd in Battel a-
gainst Heaven, and joyn'd in confederacy to make
Mankind more wicked, than ever,the Devil ha4
the impudence to desire of them This calls out
aloud for the Help of all the Powers of Govern-
ment, and all the strength of Wit and Virtue to
detect and expose it. t .

thxovtf their Mites into this Treasury, and some
zealous Reformers, may at last make the attempt: upon these Foundations.
i. A strict Execution of the Laws against Vice i
#e have already/and are every Day making very
good Laws to reform the People: But theBeftefit of
Laws consists in the executive power, which if not
vigorously put forth, Laws become useless, and it
were better they were not made at all, I was once going to have added here a Treatise, entituled, an
Essay upon the Insignificancy of Laws and Acts of
Parliament England; but upon second Thoughts*
resolving to mingle no Satyr with my serious Ob-
servations, I omitted this also. The Deficiency
of our Laws, is chiefly in the Want of Laws
to reform the Law-makers, that the Wheel of exe-
cutive Justice might be kept going j Of what
Use else can laws be?
(a) An exemplar Behaviour in our Gentry, after whose Copy the poor .people generally write;
not but that I acknowledge it will be harder,
to reform a Nation, than it would to debauch
it; though Virtue should obtain upon Cu-
stom y and become the fashion, because Incli-
nation does not stand neuter; but it would be
a great Step to this Reformation, if we could all joyn to discourage Immorality by Example $
That if a Man will be drunk or lewd, he slialt
as a "thiefrobs & Housey do it in the Dark, and
be ashamed of it. If these two Heads were
brought to pass, I question not but Reformation
would come to such an heighth, that if a poor
Mary happened to be drunk, he should come and desire the Constable to set him in the Stocks, for
fear of worse Punishment; and if a rich Man
swore an Oath in his Passion, he should send his
-Footman to the next Justice of the Peace with his

Fine, and get a Discharge for fear of being in formed against and exposed.
In order to the furthering this great Work> it
would be veryonecetfary^ if possible* ;o draw, the
picture of our modem Vices^ t<j> let Mankind fee
by a true Light what they are doing, and how ugly a Phyz the Mistress they cpurt really appear?
with, when Inclination which paints her indifip*
rent-Colours is taken off;
, 'Twill be impossible to bring Vice out of fa stxion, if we £a#not bring Men tp an Understands
ing of what it really is: But could we prevail up-
on a Man to examine his Vice,: <to.dissect: its Parts,
and vkvtf' the Anatomy[of it; to fee how disagrees
able it is to him as a Man, as a, Gentleman* or
a ChristianJ how despicable and contemptible in
its highest Fruition, how destructive to his Sense%
Estate,and reputation ; how di{honourable,and ho'vf
beastly^ in its publick appearances, such a Man
would certainly be out of Love with it, and be
but Mankind once out of love with Vice, the Re-
formation is half brought to pass. , ^2 I shall not pretend to invade the province t of
the Learned, nor offer one Argument from Scrip-
ture^ or Providence, for I am supposed to be talk fog to Men that doubt or deny them both. Divi-
nity is not my Talent, nor ever like to be my
Profession, the Charge of Priestcraft and School-
men would no<t lie against me j besides, *tis not

that something was superior, whose influence go-

full of enmity against the supreme Being, has of-

but never prompted the most barbarous nations to
deny the Being of a God and *tis thought that

'Tis worth Observation, after the most con-
vincing arguments that Nature and Reason can
produce for the Existence of a Deity, what weak, foolish, ridiculous Shifts the most refined of our
Atheistical Disputants fly to in Defence of their

not reflect upon them in the: Very Act, and give
the Lie to their arguments* My Lord Rochester%

Assurance he; has of the Negative, and what a
Kisqije he lunsr if he stidiiB be mistaken > this we
are sure of, if we want Dfenlonsttation to proVd
the'Beifrg of a God, they are much more at a
Loss for a^ Demonstration to prove, the Negative.
Now no man can answer it to his prudence, to
take the Risque theyfun, upon an uncertain suppo-
sititious Motion; for if there be such a Thing as a
first Cau% ..which we call God, they have very
little, reason to expect much from him, who have
,made it their Business to affront him by denying
his existence. , Ifor have they actedin their De-

in'all tti^'Sktyr upon Religion that ever I saw* as
if the Muse were not so much an Atheist as the
Poet, but batiks the Hint, and could not favour a
blasphemous Flight with so much Freedom and
Spirit that at other Times-is has shown which is
< a Notice that there is a tacit Sense of the Deity*
though they pretend to deny it lodged in the Un-
derstanding, that it is not stifled without some
Difficulty, and struggles hard with the Fancy,
When the Party strives to be more than ordinary
Insolent with his Maker. -
In the next Place as \k one o£'the worst Immoral ir
tjes of Conversation when it is prophane,soBlasphe-
my is the Extream of Prophaneness; you cannot
come into Company with &n Atheist, but you have
it in his common Discourse; he is always putting
some Banter dr foolish Pun* upon Religion, affront-
ing the invisible Power, or ridiculing his Maker-;
all his Wit runs out into it,as all Diseases ru&into
the Plague in a Time of Infection, and you must
h^ve Patience to hear it or quarrel with him*
Below these we have a Sort of People who will
acknowledge a God, but he must be such a one^
as they please* to make him; a fine well bred good
natur'd Gentleman like Deity* that cannot have
the Heart to damn any of his Creatures to an
Eternal Punishment, nor could not be so weak as
to let the Jews crucify his own Son > these Men ex-
pose Religion, and all the-Doctrines of Repentance,
and Faith in Christ, with all the Means of a
Christian Salvation, as matter of Banter and Ridi-
cule. Th& Bible they fay is a good History in
most Parts, but theStory'of our Saviour they look
upon as a tneer' Novel, and the Miracles of the
New Testament as a Legend of Priestcraft.

Methinks, I need not make nan Apology for
this, 'as if I meant,, that Quarreling and.Fighting
were a proper Practice in the Cafe ,-, the Law does
not admit' it in any Cafe nor is it seasonable it
fliould, and God Almighty-is far from desiring
us to' run any Risque., in his Service: But I. chuse
to bring thpf Cases into a Parallel, to signify, that
I think "ris a vulgar Error in our Behaviour, not
to show our Resentment, when we hear the Ho-
nour and Essence of God slighted and, denied, his
Majesty abused, and Religion bantered and ridi-
culed in common discourses. , I think it would
be very reasonable, to tell a Gentleman he wants
Mabners, when he talks reproachfully of his Ma-
ker, and to ufeJiimscurvily if he resented it. It
would very well become a Man of Quality to
earie a lew'd Fop, or kick him down Stairs, when
his Insolence took a Loose at Religion in his Com-?
p$.ny, else Men may be bullied out of their Chri-
stianity, and lampooned into Prophaneftess, for
Fear of being counted Fools.

* Upon which Account, even in good* Manners,

4- Of
4, Of Lewd and Jmmodeft Discourse,
 
Alking Bawdy, that Sodomy of th?
Tongue has the most of ill Manners, and
the least of a Gentleman in it, of apy
Part of common Discourse. Sir George
Mackenzie h$s yery handsomely expos'd it in its
proper Colours,: Put it pay not be an Intrench-
ment at ali upon his Province, to fay something
to it in tfyeso Observations.
'This Partis the puculiar Practice of such Persoq
as aV?hardened to a Degree beyond other Men
proficients in Debauchery, whose Lives are so con-
tinually devoted to Lewdness, that their Mouths
cannot contain it; who can govern their Tongues
no better than their Tails, and are willing to be
thpught what really they are. In these, it is
neither so strange, nor so much a Crime as in o-
itievs] these are Persons not to be r^claim'd. This
fart of my Observation is not sufesigned for their
Use; they are not to be talk'd out of their Vicei
^heymustgo on and run their Length: Nothing
btuta Goal or an Hospital ever brings them to a
^formation ? t|xey repent sometimes in that Em-
blem of Hejl, a fjuxing House, and under the Sur-
geons glands, wish ^ litftle they had been wiser;
but they follow one Sin with another, till their
Carcass stinks as bad as their Discourse, and the
Body becomes too nasty, for the Soul to stay any
longer in it: From these no Discourse is to be ex-
pected, but what is agreeable to the Tenor of
their Lives; for them to talk otherwise, would be
jftrain'd and excentrick, and become them as lit-
:' 'tie,
s
tfe, as it would be tedious to them; but for a

Bre said still to be the Consequences of criminal
Nature, and*tio Virtue in itself, because no P£rF
of the Body had been unfit -td bt exposed, if
Vice had not made the Diftin&iori necessary. •'
But ffcom this very Argiimefrt^ lewd Discouirse dpi
pears to be a Sin against Custom and Deeefrcy s sot
why must the Tongue industriously expose Things;
and Actions at which Nattire bliffhes, andwhief^
Cuftdm; kt-the Original be^h^t it wify has dedi-
cated;
p£t$d to Bfivaey and Retirement? What itit fe&true, that shame is th<? Consequence of Sin,
#nd,that Modestycan not ah original Virtue; it
, cannot but be allowed, that sinhas thereby
brought us to' a Necessity of Aaking Modesty be
a virtue, and Sin would ;have a double influence tfponus, if after it had made us asti^mM, it should
make us not afhajn'd again.x , ,'
v'Tis in my; Opinion a Mistake, when we fay,
Sin' was the immediate Cause of Shame r'cwas Sin
indeed gave a Nudity to our Natures and Acti-
ons s' the innocence which served as a glory and
Covering, being gone* then .Shame came in a$
th6 .Effect of the conscious Sinner; soth^Text
fays* They knew that they were .naked; Shame was
the, effect of Nakedness, as Nakedness was the
Effect of Sin.
, Firom hence then I argue, and this is the "Rea-
son of my naming it. That to, be afliam'd of our
JSfakednefe, is a token of our Wisdom, and a
^>$umeftt of our, just Sense of the first Sin that
made it so $nd as much a Duty now, as any
other Part of our repentance. , 'to give theTongtie then a Liberty in that which
there is so much Reason to blush at, argues no
Jknse of the Original Degeneracy. Where is
the Man that partakes not of Adam'sFall, has 90 vxdious contracted Habit and Nature convey'd
to, him from his Grand-Predecessor? Let him
come forth, let him go naked, and live by himself,
$nd |let his Posterity partake of his Innocence \
his Tongue cannot offend, nothing can be inde-
cent for Jiim to fay3 nothing uncomely for him
to fee.
But if these Gentlemen think it proper to covet
their Nakedness: with their. Clothes, methinks
they flioyld not be always uncovering it again
1 with
with their Tongues; if there are some needful
Things, which nature requires to be done in se-
cret, and which they by Inclination chuse to act
in Private: What Reason can they give for speak-
ing of them ip Publick.
There is a strange incongruity in the Behaviour
of these People, that they fill their Mouths with
the foul Repetition of actions, and Things which
their own Practicing in Private condems them for^
nay, which they would be ashamed to do in Pub*
lick; such Men ought to act the common Require-
ments of Nature, in the most publickest Places of
the Streets, bring their Wives or Whores to the
Exchange, and to'the Market Places, and Lye ll them in the Street, or else hold their Tongues,
and let their Mouths have no more the Stench of
their Vices in Publick, than their Actions.
* And why of all the rest of the Parts of Life,
must the Tongue take a peculiar Licence to re*
tel thus upon Nature?, as if she had a Mind to
reproach her with the infirmities she labours un^
der: The Customs we are obliged' to, this' they are
Cloggs upon Nature, and a Badge of original
detection ; yet' neither is there any thing so odi-
ous, or so burdensome, that these Gentlemen
should triumph over the Nur(e that brought them
up.' * * . [ '*''
Take the lewdest and most vicious Wretch that, ever gave his Tongue a Look in this hateful Pra-^
,ctice, and turn him about to his Mother, you shall
"hardly prevail upon him to talk his lewd language to her; there is something nauseous and surfeiting
in that thought; This talking Bawdy, is like
a Man going to" debauch his own Mother j fo<?
*tis raking into the Arcana,and exposing the Na-
kedness of Nature, the common Mother of us all.

If, as a famous Man of Wit pretended, lying
*with a Woman was the homeliestthing thatmast can* db;9ti$ rtiuch mbretrue, that talking of it is the
holiest thing that Man can far Not is there so me any Jest in these things, no
appearance of Mirth: There may be some Plea-6
sore in wicked actions, as the World rates Plea-
sure, but I must profess 'tis dull, and for Want of
other more regular Tastes, that there should be
Pleasure in the Discourse: JTis a prophaning of
nature, and bringing forth those Things flie has
hallowed to S^cresy and Retirement, to the scan-'
d&lous Indecency'of publick Banter and Jest.
But men, who have always something jo fay
for their folly, tell us, *tis Custom ojrfy which
has made any 6( these things [uncommon; and
there's no Sin in speaking that which there is no
sin in doing.
Let us grant them, that Custom only has done
this: But if Custom has made these things common, and concealed, or at least, banifh'd them
from the Voice of Conversation. 'Tis a Sin then
against Custom to expose them again. Lawful
Customs become allowed Virtues, and ought to*
be preserved. Custdm is a, good Reason in such
Concealments j if Custom has locked them up, let
them remain so; at* least, till you can give a bet-
ter Reason for calling thfetti abroad again, than
custom has given for restraining them. Custom
has made these things uncommon, because that
'Sin, which first made^ Nature riake<& left her so
captivated, by fomeii>f her Parts more than others,
that she could not but blush at th^(e^where Sin
haditaken up its peculiar Residence/ * Now, as t

, Tis scarce fit to say, how far some- People j*$
in this Folly, to call it no worse, even till soirie-
times they bring the general Credit of their
Conversation into decay^, and Peopl^-ihat aroused
to them, learn td lay no Stress upon any thing they fay. . , . ,\; Vig — V "'"H
for once we will suppose a story to be in it$
stance true, yet'to what monstrous a Butt doth it grow,1 by that frequent' Addition put to!
it in the relation,* till not only,it comes to be im-
probable, but even impossible to be true; and the
ignorant Relator is so tickled with having made
a good Story of it, whatever it was when he
found it, that he is blind to the Absurdities and Inconsistencies of /fact in Relation, and tells it
with a full face, even* to» those that are able to confute it, by proving it to- be impossible.
* I once heard a Man who would have taken it*
very ill to be thought a- Lyar, tell " hi story, the
Facts of which were impoflible to be true i and yen
Assert it with so much assurance, and declare so
positively, that he had been an'eye- witness of; it
himself* that there was iiothirig to'dp but in respect,
to th£"Man, Vet hm'alone an% [ay nothing.,
Gfcntseman who sat by, and whose good.Breeding*
restrained his Passion, ,turn d to .him,- and said, did

ReVatoT: Well &Y, Replies the Geritlem^ since you

Mathis broke the silence, set all the Cqmpany a
laughing; and exposed thevFal£bood, more than
down right telling him itVas a Lye, which naigbt:
foesides'fiave made a Broil ab$ut*it<
'Tis
i
'Tis a str^nglnrhiiTg^'that: we cannot be, con-
tent to tell a Story as it is, but we must take from
it on one Side, or add to it another ; till the fact is lost among thtAddmda, and till inTime even
the Man himself remembring it only as he told it
last, really forgets how it was Originally; this
being so generally practised now, nothing is more
common, than to have two Men tell the fame
Story quite differing one from another, yet both
of them Eye-Witnesses to the fact related. These
are that fort of People, who having once told a
Story falfly, tell it so often in the fame or like
manner, till they really believe it to be true. This supplying a Story by Invention, is certainly
a most scandalous Crime and yet very little regarded
in that Part, it is a sort of Ly ing that makes a great
Hole in the Heart, at which by Degrees a Habit of Lying enters in: Such a man comes quick-
ly up, to a total disregarding the Truth of what he
says, looking upon it as-a Trifle, a Thing of no
import, whether any Story he tells be true or no,
so it but commands the Company as they call it 5
that is to say,procures a Laugh,or a kind of Amaze-
ment Things equally agreeable to these Story-
Tellers; for the Business is to affect the Com-
pany, either startle them with something wonder-
ful, never heard of before; or make them laugh
immoderately, as at something prodigiously ta-
king,- witty, and diverting.
It is hard to place this practice in a Station e-
qual to its Folly ,'tis a Meanness below the Digni-
ty of common sense : They that lye to gain, to
deceive, to delude, to betray as above, have some
End in their Wickedness i and though they can-
not give the Design for an excuse of their Crime,
yet it may be giv$n:as t reason and Founda-
tion of it r But to lye for Sport' for Fun, as the
Boys express it, is to play at Shutro-ftock with your Soul, and load your Conscience for the meer fake
of being a Fool, and the making A meerBuffbonry
of a story, the Pleafare of what is below even
Madness itself. ^'
And yet, how gotfmfon is this folly ? How
is it the character of some Men's Conversation,
that they are made up of Story? And how mean
a Figure is it they bear in Company > Such Men
always betray their Emptiness by this, and ha-
ving only" a certain Number of Tales in their
Budget, like a Pedlar with his Pack, they can
only it every, House shew the fame Ware over
again, tell the same Story over and over, 'till the
fit is quite worn out and to convince us, that
much of it, if not all, is born of Invention, they
seldom tell it the same Way twice3 but vary it
even in the most material Facts: So that though
it may be remembred, that it was the fame Story,
it ought never to be remembered, that it was told
by, the fame Man.
With ^what Temper should I speak of these
People? What Words can express the Meanness
andfksenefs of theMind, that can do thus? that sin
without Design, and not only have no End in
the View, but even no reflection in the Act : the
Folly is grown up to a Habit, and they not only
mean no ill, but indeed mean nothing at all in it*
It is a strange Length that some people run in this Madness «qf Life, and it is so odd, so
unaccpuntable, that indeed 'tis difficult to describe
the Man, tho' ^not, difficult to describe the fact, what Idea can be formed in the Mind, of a Man,
who does ill without meaning ill? that wrongs himself, affronts Truth, and imposes upon his
Friends, and yet means noHarm; or to use his own
Words, means nothing? That if he thinks any
Thing
Thing, 'us* to make the Company pleasant, and
what is this but making 'the Circle & Stage, and
himself the Merry Andrew.
 The best Step such Men can take is to LYE
ON; and this /hewsthe Singularity of the Crime; it
is aitrange Expression, but I shall make it out; their
Way is, I soy, to Lyeron; 'till their Character is
compleatly known, and then they can-lyetfo long-
er ; for he whom no Body believes, can deceive no
Body, and then the Essence of Lying is removed s for
the Description ."of-a Lye is, that ?tis spoken to
deceive, or'tiS' a* Design to deeeivei Now, he
that no Body believes, can never lye any mord,
.because no Body can be deciev'd by him. Such
a Man's Character's a Bill upon his Forehead, by
Which every Body knows, Here dwells a Lying
Qsmgue:( When * everybody knows what is to be
had of him, they "know what to expect; and so
no Body is deceived; if they believe him after-
wards, 'tis< their Fault as much as his.
1 There are a great many Sorts of those People,
who make it their Business to go about telling
Stories; it would be endless to enumerate them,
some tell formal Stones forg'd in their own Brain
without any Retrospect either on Persons or Things;
I mean, as to any particular Person, - or Passage
known, or in Being,' and only with the ordinary
Introduction of, Tshe?* was a Man, or, there was
a Woman, and the like.
Others^ again, out of the fame Forge of Inven-
tion, hammer out the very Person, Man or Wo-
man, and begin, / knew the Man, or I knew the Wo~
many and these ordinarily vouch their Story with
more Assurance than others; and vouch also, that
they knew the Persons who wete concerns in it.J
The selling or writing a Parable, or an allu-
sive allogorick History is quite a different Ca%
- '«' 1 z and
[ "<*.]
and is always Distinguislit from this other Jest-
ing with Truth; that it is designed and effectually
turn'd for instructive and upright Ends, and has
its Moral justly apply'd: Such are the historical
Parables in the holy Scripture, such the Pilgrims
Progress, and such in a Word the Adventures of
your fugitive Friend, Robinson Crusoe.
1 , Others make no Scruple to relate real Stories
with innumerable Omissions and Additions: I
mean, Stories which have a real Existence in Fact,
but which by the barbarous Way of relating) be-
come as romantick and false, as if they had no real
Original. These Tales, like the old Galley of
Venice, which had been so often new vamped,
doubl'd and redouble, that there, was not one
Piece of the first Timber in her/<have been told
wrong so often, and so many Ways, 'till there
, would not be one Circumstnnce of the real Story
left in the relating.
There are many more Kinds of these, such
namely, as are personal and malicious, full of
Slander and Abuse; but these are not of the
Kinds I am speaking of; the present Business is
among a Kind of white Devils, who do no
Harm or Injury to any but, to themselves; they
areJike the .Grafliopper^ that spends his Time
to divert the Traveller, and does nothing but
starve himself. .The Conversation of these Men
is full of Emptiness^ their Words <are Levity itself,
and according to the Text, they not only tell Un-
. truths, but the Truth is not in them. There is not
a settled Awe or Reverence of Truth upon their
Minds; 9tis a Thing of up Value to them, 'tis
not regarded in their Discourse, and they give
themselves a Liberty to be perfectly unconcern'd
about the Thing they fay, or the Story they tell?
whether it be true, or no.
* This
\
This is, a mail abomjnable'Practice on another
account namely3 that thefej&zn make a jest of
their Crime; they are a §drt of people that Sin
laughing; that play upon their Souls as a Man
plays upon a Fiddle, to make other People dance
.and wear itself out; they may be said to make
,some sport indeed, but .it is allat themselves,
they are the Hearers Comedy and their own Tra-
gedy; and like a penitent JacVpuddhig, ihey will
£t last fay, I have made others merry^ 'but I have been the fool -
I would be glad to shame Men of coining £enfe, oufcof this horrid Piece of buffoonery ; and
one^ Thing I would warn them of, namely, that: their learning tp Lye so.cpr$ently' in Story, wilt
ipsensibly bring them to a bold entrenching upon
<Truth? 'in the rest of their Conversation; the Scripture Command is, L.t everyMan speak'Truth
unto his Neighbour; it we jnust tell stories, tell
them as Stories? add nothing .willfully to illustrate
or set it forth *k ;the Relation p if y:ou doufctf the
Truth of it, fay so, and'then every one will be at
jLiberty to bel eve their Share of it.
Besides, there is a spreading Evil in telling a
jfalfe story as true, namely, that you put it into
the Mouths pf /others/ and it continues a brooding
forgery to the End of Time/tis a Chininey-corner
romancer, and/has in it this 4fst*ngui&ing Article,
that whereas Parables, and the inve^tio^ns of Men

mains allusive^oQly, as it was intended, as in feve •

and without; here the Case alters, Fraud goes unto
the World's End, for story, never dies every Rec-
tor Vouches, it for truth, tho' he knows nothing of the Matter. t
These men know not what Foundations they
are laying for handing on pas sport of Lying, for
such they make of" it to posterity, hot only leaving
the Example, but dictating the very materials for the Practice ; like Family-Lies handed on from
Father to Son, till what begun in Forgery £nd$

and as 1 thought, wkh some Pleasing,, to what I
was faying: And ^ft$r J had done, Pray- Sir, fays

Madam, said Iso we .began ^ the following short

Old Gem. Pray Sir,in,all your Trayels> c^n yo\i
Ipell what is the World a-doing? Wjbat,have you
pDscrv'd to be $h? principal'Bufinds bj Mankind?
"Rob.Cru. Truly Madam, 'us very hard to an-
. fiver such a Question, the People being* so differ
rently employ'd, some one Way, and some another;
/ and particularly, according to the several Parts of
die World, thro' which our Observations are to
run, and according to the differing Manners, Cu-
stoms, and Circumstances of the People in every
Race. , ^ . , ^ -
„ Old Gent. Alas ! «£rr,that,is no Answer at all to
me,' because I am «ot- a Judge of the differing
Customs and Manners of the People you may
speak of: B(ut, Is, there, not om common End and.
Design in the Nature of Men, which seems to
run thro" all their Actions, and to be formed by
Nature* as the main End of Life, an4 by Conse-
quence is made the chief Business of Living? Pray,
how do they spend their Time?
R.C. Nays how Madam you have added a
Question to tjie test, of a d.$erent Nature from
what, if I take ypuright, you meant ac first;
Qld Gent.~ What Question, Sir?
R.C. Why! how Mankind spend their Time;
for I cannot say, that one half of Mankind spend
their Time in what they themselves may acknow-
ledge to be the main End of Life.
Old Gent. Pray, don't distinguish me out of my
Quests on, we may talk of what is the true End of
Life, as we understood it here in a Christian Coun-
try another Time: But take my Question as I
offer it, What is Mankind generally a doing as their
piain Business?
R* C Truly, the main Business that Mankind
seems to be doing, is to eat and drink, that's their
Enjoyment, and to get Food to cat is the r Em*
'ployment, including a little, their eating and
devouring one another*
Old Q en
t114 3
Old Gent.'4 That's a description of them as
Prutes. c
ii. G: It is so in head first Part, namely, their
Living to e^t ana drink : But in the last Part they' re worse than the brutes,* for the Brutes1 destroy
pot their own Kind, but all prey upon a different
species ; and besides, they prey upon one another^
for Necessity, to satisfy their flunger, and for
food : But Man for baser Ends, such as Ava-
rice, Envy, Revenge,, and the like j devours his'
own Species, nay, his own Flesh and'Blopd? a^
jjny Lord Rochester1 very weli expresses it. '<

QldGenu Ail this I believe "is true; but this
$does not reach my question yet: There is, cer-
tainly something among them, which is esteeipe4
as more particularly the EndpfLife, and of living, than the rest; to which they apply in common^
$s the main Business, and which it is always esteem,-
,cd to be their Wisdom" to beemploy vd in: Is theres
pot something thatft apparently the great J3u|in?ss
pi Living) -
, i$SC. Why really, Madam, I think not. For
Example: Great part of the World, and a
greater Part by far than we imagine, is resol v'd in-
teethe lowest Degeneracy of human Nature, I
mean the Savage Life ; whpre the chief End of
Life seems to be meerly to eat and drink, that is
to! fay, to get their food, just as the brutal Life
is employs ^nd indeed with very little Difference
between them; for expept pnly Speech and Idcn
latry, I fee nothing in the Life of some whole Na-
tions of people, and for ought I know, containing
Millions of Souls, in which the Life of a Lion' s an Elephant in tfie Pesarts of Arabia, is no? e guah
Old Gent. Lcould mention many things, sir, in which they might differ, but that is not the parent thing I enquire about: But, pray Sir, Is pot
Religion the Principal Business of Mankind in. all
the Parts of the World; for I think you granted
it when you nam'd-fcloLatry, which they, no doubt^ call Religion >
R. C Really, Madam, I cannot fay it is; because,
what with Ignorance on one hand, and Hypocri-
sy on the other, 'tis very hard to, know where tp
fined religion in the World.
4 Old Gent. You! avoid my question tpo laborious-
ly, Sir, I have nothing to do either with the Ig-
norance or hypocrisy of the people, whether they
are blindly devout, orknavislily and designedly de-
Votit, is not the Case; but whether Religion is not apparently the main Business of the World, the
principal apparent End^of Life, and the Employ-
ment of Mankind?
R, C* Why do you call Religion?
Old,Gmt%
{iOldGeHt. By Religion, I mean; the WorHiip*
ping and Paying Homage to some supreme being* some God, knownor unknownisnot to the Cafe, so it1 be but to something counted supteme.
R. C. It is true, 'Madam, there are scarce .any
stations in the World fa stupid, but they give Te ftimony to the Beingx>£ a God, and hayesomc No- *
tion of a supreme Power. ,; /
Old Gem. That I know also,; but that isnot the
main Part of my Question: But my Qpinion is*
that paying a<Uvir\eWorship, Acts or Homage and
Adoration, andparticularjy, t.hat of Praying, to
the Supreme Being, which, they acknowledge, i$
derived to mankind from the Light of Nature,
tvith the Notion or Belief itself. >
& C I suppose, Madam, you mean by the Que-
stion then, whether the Notion or Belief of a God
in general,' and the Sense of Worship in particu-
lar* are not ®t\t <and the same natural Principle* >
OldGem. I do so, jtf you and I do but agree
*boutwhat we call worship. < R. C. By Worsliip, I un4erstar*d Adoration. ,
Old Gent. But there you and I differ again #iifc-
riej for by Worship, I understand supplication.
R. G Then you must take them both in toge-
ther ,* for some Part of the /tfÆ^,5£vages only
adore. N *i ^ ,
Old Gem. I confess there is much Adoration, "wherethere is little Supplication.
R. C\ You distinguish too nicely, Madat^. v ^
Old Gent No, .no, I do not distinguish in what
I call Worship $ I alledge, that all the Adofra-
^ion of those poor savages is mere supplication?
iCouiay theylise up their Hands to their idol j, for
Fear they should hurt them.
R. C I4o say fo, saidit is apparent.
Old Gem.
6ld Gem. Why, that is the fame thing, for thm
they lift up their Hands to him, that is to fay*
pray to him not to hurt them £ for all the Wor-
ship' in the World, especially the outward Per-
formance, may be resolv'd into Supplication.
R> R. I agree with you in that, if you mean thfe
apparent End of Worship.
Old Gent. Why I did not your Man Friday and
the Savage Woman you tell us of, talk of their
old Idol they call'd Benamuckee? And what did
they do?
R. C. It ii very true they did.
Old Gent.. And did not Friday tell you they
went up to the Hills, and (aid 0 to hirft ? Pray,
what was the Meaning of faying 0 to hiip: But
O do not hurt us; for thou art Omnipotent,
and canst *kill us i 0 heal our Distempers > for xhoix
att Infinite, and canlt do all things: O give us
what we want; for thou art Bountiful; 0 spare
M*} for thou irt Merciful; And so of all the other:
Conceptions of a God?
R. Cl Well, Madam, I grant all this, pray what
do you interirom it? What is the Reason of your
Question?
Old Gem. O Sir, I have many Inferences to
draw from it for my own Observation, I do not
set up to instruct you*
I thought this serious old Lady would have enr
teitainM a farther Discourse with me on so fruit-
ful a Subject:; but flie declined it, and left me *i>
my own Mediuti66,*which indeed Ihe had rais d
up to an unusual Pitch: And the first thing that
occurred to me, was to put me upon enquiring
after rhat nice things I ought to call Religion, in
,<the; World i seeyig reajly I found Reason to thi»k,
-\  -* - ^ . .i. . that
that there was much more Dev'otidn thatllteHgiori
in the World; in a Word, much morn Adoration
than Supplication: And I doubt,, as I come nearer
Home, it will appear, that there is .much, tfiore
Hypocrisy than Sincerity: Of which Imay speak
by itself*
In my first Enquiries, I looked bafck upon my
own Travels, alid it afforded me but a melancho-
ly Reflection, that in all the Voyages and Tra-
vels which I have employed two Volumes in giving
a Relation of, I never set my Foot in a Christian
Country, no not in circling three Parts of ,the
Globe j for, excepting, the* Brafils^ where the
Portuguese indeed profese'd the Roman^Cathohck
Principles, which however, in >Distinction front
Paganism, I will call the Christian Religion; I
say, except the Brajtls, where also J made little
Stay, I could riot be said to set Foot in a Christi*
An Country, or a Country inhabited by Christians*
from the Bay of Larache, and the Port of SaBee,
by the Straits Mouth, where I escaped from Slave-
ry, thro' the Atlantkk Ocean, the Coasts of
.Ajfrick on one Side, and of Carribbea on the Ameri-
can Shore, on the other Side; from thence to Ma-
dagascar ^ lytalabar^ and the Bay and City of Boti-
£ale, the Coast of Sumatra, Malacca, Siam, Cambo-
dia, Cochinchina, the Empire and Coast of China*
the Desarts of Karakathay, the MongulTartars, the
Siberian, the Samoieie Barbarians, and till I came
within four or five Days of Arch-Angel in the Black
Huffia.
It is5 I fay, a melancholjf Reflection to think,
how all these Parts of the World, and with infinite
KumberS of Millions of People, furnish'd with th«
Powers of Reason, and Gifts of Nature, and ma-
ny Ways, if not every Way, as capable of the
Reception of sublime things, as we are* are yet
ab&n-
C 12.7 1
abandons to the grossest ignorance and Debravity; and that not in Religion only, but even in
all the desirable Parts of humane Knowledge,
and especially Science and acquir'd knowledge. - What the Divine Wisdom has determined con-
cerning the Souls of so many Millions, it is hard
to conclude, nor is it my present design to en-
quire but this I may be allow'd here, as a Re-
mark: If they are received to Mercy in a. Fu-
ture State, according to the Opinion of some,
as having not find against saving Light, then theit
Ignorance and Pagan Darkness is not a Curse, but
a Felicity," and there are no unhappy People in
the Worlds but those lost among Christians, for
their sins against revealed Light; nay3 then being
born in the Regions of Christian Light, and ua-
det the Revelation of the Gospel doctrines, is not
so much a Mercy to be acknowledged as some
teach us, and it may in a negative Manner be true,
that the Christian Religion is an Efficient in the
Condemnation of Sinners, and loses morethan it
saves, which is impious but to imagin : On the o- ther Hand, if all those Nations are concluded
under the Sentence of eternal Absence from God,
which is Hell in the Abstract:; then what becomes
of all the sceptical Doctrines of its-"be ng incon-
sistent with the Mercy and Goodness of an infi-
nite and beneficent Being, to condemn so great a
Part of the World, for not believing in him of
whom they never had any knowledge or Instru-
ction? But I desire not to be the Promoter of un-
answerable Doubts in Matters of Religion 5 much
less would t promote Cavils at the Foundations
of Religion, either as to its profession or practice, and therefore I only name Things. I return to my
Enquiry after religion as we generally understand
the Woid\
Asii
And ill this I confine my self in my present Enqui-
ries to the particular Nations professing the Chri--
fiian religion only, and I shall take Notice after-
ward, what influence the want of Religion ha£
upon the Manners the Genius, and the Capaci^
ties of the People, as to all the improvable Parts of
human knowledge. The Moors of Barbary are Mahometans, and that
of the most degenerate and unpoliflied Sont, eYpe-
cially of that Part of the World where they live;
they are cruel as Beasts, vicious-, insolent, and in-
human as degenerated Nature can make them:
Moral Vertues have so little recommended "them-
selves to any among them, that they art) accounted
no. Accomplishment, and are in no Esteem; nor is
a Man at all respected for being grave, sober* ju-
dicious, or \vise, or for being just in his Dealings,
or soft easy in his Conversation; but Rapine and
Injury is the Custom of the Place and it is to re commend a great Man, that he is rich, powerful
in Slaves, merciless in his Government of them1,
and imperiously haughty in his whole household. Every Man is a King within himself, and regards
heither Justice or Mercy, Humanity or Civility,
either to them above him, or them below him, but just as his arbitrary Paslions guide him.
Religion here is confin'd to the Biram and the
Ramadan, the Feast and the Fall, to the Mosque
and the Bath \ reading the Alcoran on one Hand,
and performing rhe Washings and Purifications on
the other, make up their religious exercises ; and
for the rest, Conversation is eaten up with Bar-
barisms and Brutish Customs; so that there's nei-
ther Society, Humanity, Confidence in one ano-
ther, or Conversation with one another; but men! live like the wild Beasts, for every Man here real-
ly would destroy and devour the other if he could.

'This guided me to a just Reflection in Hb-
iibur of the Christian Religion, which I have os-
ten since made Use of, and which on this Occa-
sion I will make a Digression to, » That it is to
be said for the Reputation of the Christian Religi-
on in general, and by which it is justly distin-
guished from all other Religions, that where-ever
Christianity has been planted or profefs'd natio-
nally in the World, even where it has not had a
Saving Influence, it has yet had a Civilizing Influ-
ence: It has operated upon the Manners, theMa-
rals, the Politics, and even the tempers and
Dispositions of the People t It has reduced them to
the Practice of Virtue, and to the true Methods
of living, has weaned them from the Barbarous
Customs they had been used to, infusing a Kind
of Humanity and Softness of Disposition into their
very natures, civilizing andgsoftning them, teachr
iiig them to love a Regularity of Life, and filling them With Principles of generous kindness and
Beneficence one to another; in a word* it has
taught them to live like men* and act upon the
foundations of Clemency, Humanity, Love, and
and good Neighbourhood, suitable to the Nature
and Dignity of God's image, and to the Rules of
Justice and Equity, which it instructs them in.
 Nay farther, I must observe also, That as the
Christian Religion has worn out, or been remo-
ved from any Country, and they have returned to
Heathenism and Idolatry, so the Barbarisms have
return'd, the Customs of the Heathen Nations have
been again restored the very Nature and Temper of
the People, have been again lost; all their generous
principles have forsaken them, the Softness and
Goodness of their Dispositions have worn out^
&nd they have returned to Cruelty, Inhumanity^ Rapin, and blood. - It is true, and it may be nam9d as an Obje-
ction to this Remark or mine, that the Romans
the' Heathens, and the Grecians* by the Study of
Philosophy, m particular Persons, and by the
excellency of their Government in their general
or national Capacity, were fill'd with Notions of
Virtue and Honour, with most generous and just
Principles, and acted with an heroic Mind Ger many Occasions; practising the most sublime and
exalted Height of Virtue, such as sacrificing their
lives for their Country, with the utmost Zeal;
'descending to great Examples of Humanity and
Beneficence, scorning to do base or vile actions, as unworthy the Roman Name, to save their
Lives; and a great many most excellent Examples
of Virtue and Gallantry, are found in the Histo-
ries of the Roman Empires.
This does not oppose, it rather indeed illustrates
what I fay? for with all the philosophy, all the
humanity and generosity they practised, they had
yet their Remains of Barbarity, were cruel and
unmerciful in their Natures, as appear'd by the
Barbarity of their Customs, such as throwing Ma lefactors to wild Beasts, the Fightings of their
Gladiarors, and the like* which were not only
appointed as Punishments and Severities, by the
Order of Public Justice; but to shew it touched the
very Article I am upon, it was the subject of
their Sport and Diversion, these Things were ex-
hibited as Shows to entertain the Ladies $ the
Cutting in Pieces fourty or fifty Slaves, and the
seeing twenty or thirty miserable Creatures thrown
to the Lyons and Tygers, was no less pleasant to
them, than the Goipg to see an Opera, a Masque-
rade, or a Puppet Show, is to us > So that I
think, the Romans were very far from a People ci-
vilized and softened in their Natures by the Influ-
ences
[ rji J
cncss of Religion And this is evident, because*
that as the Christian Religion came among them, all those cruel Customs were abhorr'd by them, the
famous Theatres and Circles for their publick
Sports3 were overthrown, and the Ruines of
them testify the justice of my Observation at this
very Day*
Nor will it be deny'd, if I should carry thisyet
farther, and observe, That even among Christians,
those who are more reforms, and farther and far-
ther chriftiani^d, are still in Proportion rendred
more human, more soft and tender; and we do
find, without being partial to our selves, that even the Protestant Countries are much distinguished in the Humanity and Softness of their Tempers, the
meek mercitul Disposition extends more among
Protestants, than among the Papists, as I could
very particularly demonstrate from History and
Experience.
But to return back to the Moores, where I left
off, they are an instance of that Cruelty of Dispo-
sition, which was anciently in their Nature, and how in a Country abandoned of the true Christian
Religion, after it has been first planted and pro-
fess'd among them, the Return of Heathenism ot
Mahometanism has brought back with it all the
Barbarisms of a Nation void of Religion and good
Nature.
I saw enough of these dreadful People to think
them at this Time the worst of all the Nations of
the World; a Nation, where no such thing as a
generous Spirit, or a temper with any Compas-
sion mixt with it, is to be found; among whom Kature appears stripped of all the additional Glo-
ties, which it derives from religion, and yet whejœ-
on a Christian flourisliiftg Church bad stood several
hundred Years,
K a From*
From there I went among the Negroes of AfricaGermany of them I saw without any the least No-
tion of a Deity among them, much Jess any Form
of Worship; but I had not any Occasion to con-
verse with them on Shore, other than I have don©
since by accident* but went away to the Brajils i
Here I found the Natives, and that even before the
Portuguese came among them, and since also, had Abundance of religion, such as it was: But it was all so bloody, so cruel; consisting of Murders, human Sacrifices^ Witchcrafts, Sorceries, and Con-
jurings, that I could not so much as call them ho-
nest Pagans, as I do the Negroes,
As for the Cannibals, as I have observed in the
Discourse of them, on Account of their landing on my Island* I can say but very little of them:
As for their eating human Flesh, I take it to be a
Kind of martial Rage, rather than a civil Pra-
. ctice; for 'tis evident, they eat no human Crea-*
tares, but such as are taken Prisoners in their Bat-
tles j and as I have observed in giving the Account
of those things, they do not esteem it Murder, no
nor so much as unlawful. I must confess, saving
its being a practice in itself unnatural, especially
to us, I say, saving that Part, I see little Difference
between that and our Way, which in the War it frequent a Heat of action, viz. refusing Quarter;
\ for as to the Difference between Eating and^Kil-
ling those that offer to yield, it matters not much. And this I observed at the fame Time, that in
their other conduct, those Savages were as human,
mild, and gentle, as most I have met with in
the World, and as easily civilized.
From these Sorts of People, I come to the Indh
. ans; for as to the Madagascar Men, I saw very
. little of them? but that they were a Kind of Ne-
groes, much like those on the Coast of Guinea,on-
I m 1
fy, a little more used and accustomed to the Eurof-eansy by their often Landing among them.
The E. Indians are generally Pagans or Mahome-
tans, and have such Mixtures of Savage Customs
with them, that even Mahometanisin is there in
its Corruption; neither have they there, the up-
right just Dealing in Matters of Right and Wrong,
which the Turks in Europe have, with whom 'tis
generally very safe trading: But here they act all
the Parts of Thieves and Cheats, watching to de-
ceive you, and proud of being thought able tQ
do it.
The subjects of the great Mogul have a seeming
polite Government; and the Inhabitants of Cey-
lon are under very strict Discipline; and yet what
Difficulty d o we find to trade with them? Nay,
their very Oeconomy renders them fraudulent,
and* in some Places they cannot turn their
Thoughts to being honest.
China is famous for wisdom, that is to fay ^ that
they, having such a boundless Conceit of their own
Wisdom, we are obliged to allow them more than
they havethe Truth is, they are justly said to be
a wise Nation among the foolish ones, and may
as justly be called a Nation of Fools among the'
wife ones.
As.to their Religion, 'tis all summ'd up in Con*
fucius his Maxims, whose Theology, I take to
be a Rhapsody of Moral Conclusions; a Founda-
tion, or what we may call Elements of Policy,
Morality and Superstition, huddl'd together in 3,
Rhapsody of Words, without consistency, and
indeed with very little Reasoning in it: Then 'tis
really not to much as a resin tl Paganism, fo^
there are in my Opinion much more regular Do-
ings among some of the Indians that are Pagans in
America, than there in China : And if I may be-
Rj Ueve*
lieve the account given of the Government o$
Montezuma in Mexico, and of the Unca's of Cuzcoin Peru; their Worship and Religion such as it
was, was carry'd on with more Regularity than
these in China. As to the human Ingenuity, as they
call it, of the Chmses, Fsliall account for it by itself:
The utmost Discoveries of it to me appear'd in the
Mechanicks, and even in them infinitely short of
of what is found among the European Nations,
But let us take sthese People to Pieces a little,
and examine into the great Penetration, they are
so famed for: First of all, their Knowledge has
pot led them that Length in religious Matters,
which the common Notions of Philosophy would
have done,and to which they did lead the wiseHea-*
thens of Old among the Grecian and RomanEm1
pires ,* for they having not the Knowledge of the
true God, preserved notwithstanding, the Notion
of a God to be something Immortal, Omnipo-
tent, sublime; exalted above in Place, as well as
Authority; and therefore made Heaven to be
the Seat of their Gods, and the Images by
which they represented the Gods and Goddesses^ had always some perfections that were really to be
admired; as the attendants of their Gods, as
'Jupiter was call'd the Thunderer, for his Power %
Father of Gods and Men, for his seniority ; Ve-
tius adored for her Beauty; Mercury for Swiftness i
Apollo for Wit, Poetry, Mnsick; Mars for Terror
and gallantry in Arms, and the like: But when
we come to these polite Nations of China, which
yet we cry up for Sense, and Greatness of Genius,
we fee them groveling in the very Sink and Filth
of Idolatry; their Idols are the most frightful mon-
strous shapes, not the Form of any real Creature,
much less die Images of Virtue, of chastity, of Li-1
teraturfe i but horrid Shapes of their Priests Inven-
1 » tA " * 'tionj
Hon; neither helfifh or human Monsters composed
of invented Forms, with neither Face or Figure,
but with the utmost Distortions, form'd neither to
walk, stand, fly, or go; neither to hear, see, or
speak, but merely to instill horrible Ideas of some-
thing nauseous and abominable, into the Minds
of Men that ador'd them.
If I may be allowed to give my Notions of Wor-
ship, I mean, as it relates to the Objects <rf natur
ral Homage, where the Name and Nature of Gpd
is not reveafd, as in the Christian Religion. I must
acknowledge, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the
Elements, as in the Pagan and Heathen Nations? pfold; and above all these, the Representations of
superiour- Virtues and Excellencies among
Men, such as Valour, Fortitudje, Chastity, Pa-
tience, Beauty, Strength, Love, Learning, Wis-
dom, and the like; The Objects of Worship in
the Grecian and Roman Times, were far more eligi-
ble, and more rational objects of divine Rites, than
the Idols of China and Japan; where with all the
Oeconomy of their State Maxims and Rifles of
Civil Government, which we insist so much on* <as Tests of their wisdom, their great Capacities,
and Understandings; their worship is the most:
brutish, and the objects of their worship, the
coursest, the most unmanly, inconsistent with Rea-
son oj: the Nature of Religion of any the World
can shew; bowing down to a meer Hob-gobblin,
and doing their reverence not to the Work of
Mens hands only, but the ugliest, basest, fright-
fullest things that Man could make; Images so
far from being lovely and amiable, as in the Na-
ture of Worship is implied, that they are the most,
detestable and nauseous, even to Nature.
How is it possible these People can have any
claim to the character of wife, ingenious, polite,
K 4 '* th<ai
that could suffer themselves to be overwhelmed in
an Idolatry repugnant to common Sense, even to
Nature, and be brought to chuse to adore that
which was in itself the most odious and con*
temptible to Nature i not meerly terrible, that so
their Worship might proceed from Fear, but a
x Complication of Nature's Aversions.
I cannot omit, that being in one of their Tem-
ples, or rather in a kind of Oratory or Chapel,
annexed to one Part of the great Palace at Pequin,
there appear'd a Mandarin with his Attendants,
or, as we may fay, a great Lord and his Retinue,
prostrate before the Image, not of any one of God's
Creatures, but a Creature of meer human Forming,
such as neither was alive, nor was like any thing
that had Life, ot had ever been seen or heard of
in th$ World.
The like Image, or something worse, if
I could give it a, true Representation, may be
found in a Garden Chapel, if not defae'd by wi-
ser Heads, of a great Tartarian Mandarin, at a
small Distance from ISsanquin, and to which the
poor abandoned Creatures, pay their most' blinded
Devotions.
It had a thing instead of a Head, but no Head,*
it had a Mouth distorted out of all Manner of
Shape, and not to be described fora Mouth, being
only an unflupen Chasm, neither representing the
Mouth of a Man, Beast, Fowl, or Fish;" The
Thing was neither any of the four, but an incon-
gruous Monster: It had Feet, Hands, Fingers,
Claws, Legs, Arms, Wings, Ears, Horns, every
Thing mixt one among another, neither in the
Shape or Place that Nature appointed, but blend-
ed together, and six'd to a Bulk, not a Body ,*
formed of no just Parts, Ixit a shapeless Trunk or
l*Pg> ^hpthet pf Wood or Stonp3 I Jaiownor*
'* thing
a thing that might have stood with any Side for~
v^ard3 or any Side backward, any End upward,*
or any End downward, that had as much Vene-
ration due to it on one Side, as on the other, a
kind of celestial Hedge-hog, that was roiled up
within itself, and was every thing every way,- that
to a Christian could not have been worthy to have
represented even the Devil; and to Men of common
Senses must have been their very Souls Aversion:
In a Word, if I have not represented their mpn-
stroiis Deities right, let Imagination supply any
thing that can make a misshapen image horrid,
frightful, and surprising; And you may with Ju-
stice suppose, those sagacious People, called the
Chinese*, whom forsooth we must admire, I say,
you may suppose them prostrate on the Ground *
with all their Pomp and Pageanty, which is in it
self not a little, worshipping such amapgled, pro-
miscuous gendred Creature.
Shall we call these a wise Nation, who repret
sent God in such hideous monstrous Figures as
these, and can prostrate themselves to things tea
thousand Times more disfigured than the Devil?
Had these Images been contnVd in the Romans
Time, and been set up for the God of Ugliness,
as they had their God of Beauty, they might in-
deed have been thought exquisite; but the Ro-
mans would have spurn'd such an Image out of their
temples. Nothing can render a, Nation so c6mpleatly
foolish and simple, as such an Extravagance in
Matters of religious worship ; for if gross Igno-
rance in the Notion of a God, which is so ex-
tremely natural, will not demonstrate a Nation
unpolisli'd, foolish, and weak, even next to Ideo-
tism, I know nothing that will
But
sub let me trace? this wife nation that we talk ed much of, and who not only think themselves
wise, but have drawn us in, to p^y a Kind of Elle mage to their nit wit* Government, and the Mechanic k Arts, #re the
two main things in which our People in England,who have admired them so much, pretend they
excel; as to their Government, which consists in
an absolute Tyranny, which, by the Way, is S pasiest Way of ruling in the Wprld, where the
People are dispos'd to ©bey, as blindly as the
JMandarin commands or governs imperiously>
what Policy is required in governing a Peo~
pl<e5 of whom 'tis faid,that if you command them to hang themselves,they will only cry a little, and sub-
mit immediately? Their Maxims of Government
may do well enough among themselves, but with
us, they would be all Confusion. In their Country
it is not so, pnly because, whatever the mandar'm says, is a Law, and God himself has no
Power or interest among them to contradict it,
unless he pleases to execute it hrevi manu from
Heaven,
Most of their Laws consist in immediate Judg-
ment, fwifc Executions, just Retaliations, and
fair protection from Injuries: Their Punishments
^,re cruel and exorbitant, such as Cutting the Hands
and the Feet off for Theft, at the fame Time re-
leasing Murders and other flagrant Crimes,
Their Mandarines are their Judges in very m$ny
£ases, like our Justices of the Peace; but then
they judge by Customs, Oral Tradition, or im-
mediate Opinion, and execute the Sentence im-
mediately, without room, or Time to reflect
upon the justice of it, or to consider of Mitigations^
as in all Christian Countries is practised, and as
the Seiise of human Frailty would direct.
But let me-come to their Mechanics, in which their Ingenuity is so much cry'd up, I affirm there is
little or nothing sufficient to build the mighty Opi-
pion we have of them upon, but what is founded up-
on the Comparisons whichswe make between them
and other Pagan Nations, or proceeds from the
Wonder which we make, that they ftpuld have
0,ny Knowledge of Mechanics Arts, because we
find the remote Inhabitants of Africaand America,
so grossly ignorant, and so entirely destitute in such
things; whereas we do not consider, that the Chi-
yeses inhabit the Continent of Asia; and tho' they
are separated by Desarts and Wildernesses, yec
they are a continuous Continent of Land, with
the Parts of the World once inhabited by the poli^
tet-Medes, Persians, and GreciansJthat the first
Ideas of Mechanic Arts were probably received
by them from the Persians, Assyrians, and the ba-
nifh'd transplanted Israelites, who are said to be
carry ?d into the Regions oiParthia, and the Bor-
ders of Karacathay, from whence they are also said
to have communicated Arts, and especially Han-
dicraft, in which the Israelites excelled, to the in Habitants of all those countries, and consequently
in Time to thole beyond them.
But let them be received from whom they will,
and how long ago soever; let us but compare the
Improvement they have made, with what others
have made; and except in things peculiar to them-
selves by their climate, we shall find the utmost
of their Ingenuity amounts but to a very trifle, and that they are out-done even in the best of then?
Works by our ordinary Artists, l imitations exceed their Originals, beyond all comparison. For Example, they have Gun-powder and Guns,
Whether they have learned to make them by Di-
rection of Europeans,which is most likely, or that
1' they
they found it out by mecr Strength re invention* as some would advance, tho' without Certainty, in their Favour: Be it which it will, as I fay,
it matters not much; their Powder is of no
Strength for the needful Operations of Sieges,
Mines, Batteries, no nor for shooting"of Birds, as
ours is, withoutf great Quantities put together istheir Guns are rather an orientation than for Exe-
cution, clumsy, heavy, and ill made; neither have
they arrived to any tolerable Degree of Know*
Jedge in the Art of Gunnery or Engineering they have no Bombs, Carcasses, Hand-grenades; their
artificial Fireworks are in no Degree,comparableA
or to be nam'd with ours; nor have they arrived to
any thing in the military Skill, in martialling Ar-
mies, handling Arms, Discipline, and the Exer-
cise in the Field, as the Europeans have; .all,
which is depending on the Improvement of Fir?-
Arms, CiTc. in which, if they have had the Use of
Gun-powder so many Ages as some Dream, they
must be unaccountable Blockheads, that they have
made no farther Improvement; and if it is but
lately, they are yet apparently dull enough in the managing of it, at least, compared to what ought
to be expected of an ingenious People, such as our
People cry them up to be.
I might go from this to their Navigation, in
which it is true they out-do most of their Neigh-
bours: But what is all their Skill in Sailing com^
par'd to ours? Whither do they go? And how
manage the little and foolish Barks and Jonks they
have? What would they do with them to traverse
the great Indian, American, or Atlantic Oceans?
What Ships, what Sailors, what poor, awkward, and ignorant Doings is there among them at Sea >
And when our Peop e hire any of them, as some-
times they are obliged to do, How do our Sailor^
Uck them about, as a Parcel of clumsy, ignorant unhandy Fellows?
THen for building of Ships, What are they? And what are they able to do towards the glo-
rious Art of building a large Man of War? 'Tis
out of Doubt with me, that all the people of
Chinacould not build such a Ship as the Royal So-
vereign, in a hundred Years, no not tho* 'she
was there for them to look at, and take Pattern
by. m .
I might go oh to abundance more things, such
as Painting, making Glasses, making Clocks and
Watches, making Bone-lace, Frame-work Knit-
ting; of all which, except the two first, they know
little or nothing and of the two first, nothing
compared to what is done in Europe,
The Height of their Ingenuity, and for which
we admire them tfcith more Colour of Cause than
in other things, is their Porcellain or Earthen- ware Work, which, in a Word, is more due to
the excellent Composition of the Earth they make
them of, and which is their peculiar, than to
the Workmanship i in which, if we had the fame
Clay, we should soon outdo them, as much as we
do in other things. The next art is, their Ma nufacturing in fine Silks, Cotton, Herba, Gold,
and Silver, in which they have nothing but what
is in common with our ordinary poor Weavers.
The next Mechanic Art is, their Lacquering*
which is just as in the China Ware, a Peculiar to
their Country, in the Materials, not at all in the
Workmanship: And as for the Cabinet Work 'of
it, they are manifestly out-done by us; and abun-
dance is every year sent thither framed and made in
England, and only lacquer'd in China, to be re-
turn d to us,
I might
I might run the like Parallel tliro3 most of the
things these People excel in, which would all at- pear to be so deficient,, as would render all their
fam'd Wisdom and Capacity most scandalously
imperfect: But I am not fo much upon their Cun-
ning in Arts, as upon their Absurdity and ridicu-
lous Folly in matters religious, and in which I
think the rudest Barbarians out-do them.
From this wife Nation, we have a vast Extent
of Ground, near 2000 Miles in Breadth; partly
under* the Chinese Government, partly under the
Muscovite, but inhabited by Tartars of Mongul Tar-
tar Karkathay, Siberian, and Samoides Pagans;
whose Idols are almost as hideous as the Chinese,and whose Religion is all Nature; and not only so,
but Nature under the greatest Degeneracy, and
next to Brutal. Father La Comte gives_us the Pi-
ctures of some of their House Idols, and an Ac-
count of their worship ; and this lasts, as I have
observ'd, to within a few Days of Arch-Angel;
So that, in a Word, from the Mouth of the Straits,
that is to fay, from Salleeover to Caribbea, from
thence round Africa by the Cape of good Hope,
cross the vast Indian Ocean, and upon all the
Coast of it, about by Malacca and Sumatra, thro'
the Straits ofSingaporeand the Codst of Siam North-
wards to China, and thro' China by Land over the
Desarts of the Grand Tartary, to the River Dwi-
m3 being a Circuit three Times the diameter of
the Earth, and every jot as far as the whole Cir-
cumference. The Name of God is not heard of, except among a few of the Indians that are Ma-
hometan; the Word of God is not known, or
the Son of God spoken of.
Having some Warmth in my Search after Re-
ligion, occasioned by this reflection, and so little
ofit appearing in all the Parts which I had tra-
vels
Vel*d, I resol/d to travel over the rest of the
World in Books, for my wandring Days are pretty
well over I fay, I resohrM to travel the rest inBooks; and a said I, there must appear abun-
dance of serious Religion in the rest of the World,
or else I know nothing at all of where I shall find
it.
But I find by my Reading, just as I did in Tra-
velling, that all the Customs of .Nations, as to
Religion, were much alike; that one with ano-
ther, they are more devout in their worship of
something, whatever it bey than inquisitive after
what it is they worship; and most of the Altars
of Worship in the world might to this Day be
inscrib'd to the Unknown God.
This may seem a strange thing; but that Won*
der may eeafe, when farther Enquiry is made into
the particular objects of worship, which the se-^
veral Nations of the World bow down to, some of
which, are so horrid, so absurd, as one would
think human Nature could not sink so low, as to do
her Homage in so irrational a Manner.
And here, being to speak of Religion as idola-
trous, it occurs to me, that it seem'd strange, that
except in Persia, and some Part o(Tartary> I found
none of the People look Us for their Gods, but
Down; by which it came into my Mind, that even
in Idolatry itself, the World was something dege-
nerated, and their Reason was more hoodwinks
than their Ancestors.
By looking up, and looking down, I mean, they
do not as the Romans, look up among the Stars
for their Idols, place their Gods in the Skies, and
worship, as we might fay, like Men; but look
down among the Brutes, form Idols to them-
selves out of the Beasts, and figure things like
More s 144 ]
Monsters, to adore them for their Ugliness *and horrible Deformity.
Of the Two, the former, in my Opinion, was
much the more rational Idolatry, as particularly,
the Persians worshipping the Sun ,- and when I had
a particular Account of that at Bengate, it present-
ly occur'd to my Thought, that there was some-
thing awful, something glorious^ and God-like in
the Sun, that, in the ignorance of the true God,
might rationally bespeak the Homage os'the Crea*
iures; and" to whom it seemed reasonable, where
Reason was its own Judge onlyy without the Helps qf
v Revelation, to pay an Adoration, as the parent of
Light, and the Giver of Life to all the Vegetative
World, and as in a visible Manner, enlivening and
influencing the rational and sensitive life, and which might, for ought they knew, at first create,'
as it did since, so plainly affect all things round
Us.
This Thought gave Birth to the following Ex-
cursion, with which I shall close this Observa-
tion*

which at last are refolv'd into the Degeneracy of
Mankind,and their being fallen from the Knowledge
of the true God, which was once, as we have
reason to believe, diffused to ail Mankind.
1I say, What are these? And how mutih Ground
for just Reflection do they afford us, compared
to the gross things in practice, which we find
£tery Day among those nations, who,profess to
have had the cleat Light of Gospel Revelation?
How mafcySelf-coiitradicting principled do they
hold ? How contrary to their profession do they act?
How do one Side burn for what another Side ab-
hors? And how do Christians, taking that vene-
rable Name for a general AppeUation> doom one ano-
ther to the t)evil, for a few disagreeing Clauses
of the sam^ Religion, while all profess to worship
the fame £)e*ty, aud to expect the fame Salva-
tion? * .'
With what preposterous Enthusiasms do some
mingle their Knbwledge^ and with as gross. Ab-
surdities others their Devotion? How blindly su^
perstitious o? How furious and raging in then?
Zeal? How cruel3 inexorable, and even inhuman
and barbarous to one another, when they differ?
as if Religion divested us of humanity, and that
in our worshipping a God of Mercy, and in
whose C&mpaffions alone it is. that we have room
to hope, we should to please and serve him, ba-
nish Humanity from our Natures, and shew no
compassion to those that fall into our Hands,
In my Travelling thro* Portugal, it was my Lot to
tvtetfrEisim* while they held thereon^ of their L a Courts
Cburts of Justice, cali'd Auto He fe, that is to fay
a Court of Justice of the'Inquisition 3 It is a Project has been handled by many Writers, ahd indeed
exposed by some of the best Gatholicks j and my
present business is not to write a History> or en-
gage ina Dispute, but'tb relate a passage; They carryMa inProcession all their Criminals,
to the great Church j where eight of them iap-
pears- first, dressed up in Gowns and Caps of Can-
vass, tipon-which was^paint^d all that man could'

Those I found wereefght poor Creatures con-
demn d to be burnt, and For they scarce knew what;
but for Crimes against the Catholick Faith, and
against the Blessed Virgin* and they'were burnt.
One of them, it was said, rejoie'd that he.was to
be burnt 5 and being ask'd, Why i" Atiswer'd, That
he had much rather die*- than be cafcry'd back to
the prison of the Inquisition, where their Cruel-
ties were worse than Death: Of those eight, as I
was told, some were Jews, whose greatest Crime,
as many there did not scruple to fay, Was, that
they were very rich,' and some Christians were in
the number at the fame Time, dis greatest
Misery was, that they were very poor. 1 It was a Sight that almost gave me a shock in
myNotion of Christianity itself, till I began to re-
collect, that it might be possible, that Inquisitors
were scarce Christians, and that I knew many Ca-
tholic Countries do not suffer this abominable Judi-
cature to be erected among them.
I have seen muclvand read mores of the unhap-
py Conduct in Matters of Religion, amotfg the
"other Nations of the World, professing^ t&e.Chri-
1 stia^
&ian Religion; and upon my Word, I find some
Practices infinitely scandalous, some which are the
common receiv'd Customs of Christians, which
would be the Abhorrence of Heathens; and it re-
quires a strong Attachment to the Foundation,
which is indeed the principal Part in Religion, safe guard our Minds against- being offended, even at
the Christian Religion itself; but I got over that
Part afterwards
Let it not offend the Ears of any true Lover of
the Christian Religion, that I observe some of the
follies of the Professors of the Christian Religion,
assuring you, 'tis far from being my Design to bring
the least Scandal upon the profession itself.
And here therefore let me give the Words of
a judicious Person who travell a from Turkey thro*
Italy: His Words are these,
"When I was in Italy, I ranged over great part "of the Patrimony of St.P#<?r, where one would
"think indeed, the Face of Religion would be
*c plainest to be seen* ^nd without any Disguise;
c< but in short I found there the Face of Reli^r
fc gion, and no more.
u At Rome there was all the Pomp and Glory
tc of religious Habits: The Pope and the Cardi-
<c nals walk'd with a religious gravity, but liv'd
c< in a religious Luxury, kept up the Pomp of Re-
*c ligion, and the Dignity of religious Titles:
"But like our Lord's Observation on the Phari-
<c fees, I found within they were all ravening
"Wolves.
<c The religious Justice they do there, is par-
H cularly remarkable, and very much recommends
cc them. The Church protects Murthers and As-
"saffinsj and then delivers the Civil Magistrates
c* over to Satan, for doing justice. They inter-
ftdict whole kingdoms, andsliut up the Churches
h 3 "ftlt
f fqr Want pf paying a few Ecclesiastic Bue^
* and so put a Stop to Religion for Want 0^ thci£
*; Money. I found the Courtez^m were the most-
constant Creatures at the Church, and the most
c< certain Place for an Assignation with another
fc Man's Wife, was at Prayers.
"T^e Court of Inquisition burnt two Men for
c* speaking dishonourably of the Bleflsed Virgin,
f and the Missionaries in China tolerated the Wor-?-
f (hipping the Devil by their' new Convert. A
« Jew was likewise burnt for denying Christ, while
fc the Jesuits join'd the Paganism of the Heathen
tc with the High Mass, and fung Anthems to;
V the immortal Idols of rfonquin.
u When I saw this, I refolv'd to enquire no more
after Refjgion in Italy, till by Accident meeting
*c with a Quietist, he gave me to understand, that
'*c all Religion was internals that th£ Duties of
ff Christianity were summ'd up in Reflection
?c and Ejaculation, He inveighed bitterly against
<c the Gime of Religion, which he said was
a playing over the whole World by the Clergy;
f and soid> Italy was a Theatre, where Religion
v ic was the Grand Qfera, and the Popish Clergy
^c were the Stage Players. I lik'd him in many
** of his Notions about other Peoples Religion ^
fc but when I came to talk with him a little close-
li ly about his own, it was so wrapped up in his
*c Internals, concealed in the Cavities and dark
€C parts of the Soul, viz,. Meditation without
c< Worship, Doctrine without Practice, Reflecti-
f on without Reformation, and? J£eal with-
€€ put knowledge; that I could come to nb
u £erta4inty \vith him, but in this* that Jteligiori
in Italy was realty invisible." s
This was very 'agreeable to my Notions of Ita-
lian Religion^ and to what I had met with frbm
'v' '-  '* \ * * - l< pthes
Cfl^rTtecple that had traveled the Cpimtvy? Btft
one Observation of Blindhfcse and Superstition I
piiist give within rfiy own Knowledge, and nearer
Hoitie; when passing thro" Flaftders, | found the
People in a certain City there* in a- very
great Commotion: The Case was this; A certain
Scttyrate, so they call an abandon'd Wretch given
lip to all Wickedness, had broken into a Chape}
in the City, and had stoln the Pix or Casket where-
in the sacred Host was (deposited; which Host, af-
ter rigfitly consecrated^ they believe to be the real
Body of our Blessed Saviour, being transubstantiat-
ed, as they call it, froto the Substance of Bread.
The Fact being discovers the City, as I said
above, was all up in« a Tumult; the Gates  were
shut up, no Body sufferd to go out; every House
was searched, and the utmost Diligence used; and
at length* as it was next to Impossibility he should
escape, he was discovered.
His Execution was not long dpferr'd: But first
he was examined, and I think by Torture, What
ne had done with the sacred thing which was in
the Pix, which he had stoln? And at length he
confess'cl, That he had thrown it into a House
of Office; an$ was carry *d with a Guard to shew
them the Place.
As it was impossible to find a little Piece of a
Wafer in such a Place, tho' no £ains was spar'd in
a most filthy Manner to search for it; but,'as I fay,
it could not be found, immediately the Place was
judg'd consecrated i}>Jhfa£io> turn <1 into an Orato-
ry, and the devout People flock'd to it, to expiate
by their Prayers, the Dishonour done to the Lor4
God, by throwing h*s precious Body into so vile a
Place. It was determined by the Wiser part, that the
Body would not fall down into the Place, but be
(natch'd up by its inherent Power, or by the holy
1**4 "K' Angels
Angeljs, and not be suffered to touch the Expter
inents in that place, However, the People conti-
nued their Devotions for some, Time, just in th§
place where it was, and afterwards 3, large Cha-
ipd was built upon it, where the fame Prayers are
(continued, as I suppose, to this Day.
I had a particular Occasion to come at a very
accurate Account pf Poland, by a PolishGentle-
man, in whose company I travelsd, and from
whom I learn'd all that was worth enquiring of,
^about religious Affairs in Prussia on one Side, and
Muscovy on the other.
As for Poland, he told me they were all Confu-
sion, both in Church and in State; that notwith-
standing their wars, they were Persecutors pf the
worst Kind; that they let the Jews Jive asnpng 'erfr
undisturbed, to such a Degree, that in'theCoun-'
try about Lemberg and Kiowy there were reckoned
above 30000 Jews: That these had not toleratetion only, but many Privileges granted them, tho' they deny'd Christ to be the Messiah, or that the
Messiah was come'in the Flesh 5 and blasphemed
his Name qpon frequent Occasions; and at the
fame Time they persecuted the Protestants,' and
4'estroy'd their Churches, where-ever they had
Power to do it.
On the other Hand, when I came to enquire of
those Protestants, and what Kind of People they
were, who suffered so severely for their; Religion, I found they were generally a §ort of Protestants,
ealfd Socinians^ and that Lelius Sotinus had spread
his Errors so universally over this Country,thatour
Lord Jesus Christ was reduc'd here to little more
,than a good Man sent from heaven to instruct the
World, and far from capable of effecting by the In-
fluence of his Spirit, and Grace, the glorious
Work of redeeming the World; As for„ the
Divi-
Divinity of theHoly Ghost, they have no Trour
hie about it.
Having given this Account of Knowledge
and Piety in the Countries inhabited by Christians
of the Roman Church, it seems natural to fay some
thing ot the Qrqk Church.
There are ,in thg Czar of Muscovy's Dominions
abundance of Wooden Churches; and had not
the country been as full of Wooden Priests,
something might have been said for the Reli-
gion of the Muscovites; for the People are won-
derfully devout there, which would have been ver
ry well, if it had not been attended with the pro soundest Ignorance that was $ever heard of in any
Country, where the Name of Christian was so
much as tailed of.
But when I came to enquire about their Wor-
ship/ I found our Lord Jesus Christ made so much
# meaner Figure among them than St. Nicholas,
that I concluded Religion was fwallow'd up of
Superstition; and so indeed I found it was upon all
Occasions; as to the conduct of the People in re-
ligious Matters, their Ignorance is so establisli'd
upon Obstinacy, whichis the -Muscovites national
Sin, that it would be really to no Purpose to look any longer for a reformation among them.
In short, no Man will, I believe, say of me,
that I do the Muscovites any Wrong, when I say
they are the most ignorant, and most obstinate
People in the Christian World, when I tell the
following Story of them.
It was after the Battle. at Narva^ where the
late King of Sweden Charles XII. defeated their great
Army, and after the victory, extended his Troops
pretty far into their Country, and perhaps plun-
dered them a little, as he advanc a; when the
Muscovites, we may be sure, being in thejitmost
Di Confusion, fell to their prayers We
read of nothing they had to say to God Almigh-
ty in that Case but jo their Patron Saint they
addressed this extraordinary Prayer*
OThou our perpetual Comforter in all our Adverfi*
ties I Tlhoti ^infinitelyPowerful ^Nicholaj,
by what sinand how have we highly offended thee in
our Sacrifices, ConReverences and actionsof Than/giving, that'thou hast thus forsaken us} we
had therefore sought to appease thee entirely,and we had
imploredthy presenceand thy Succour against the Terri~
ble, Insolent, Dreadful, Qnra£d, and Undaunted
Enemies and Destroyers-, when like Lyons, Bears,
and other Savage Beafis, that have lost their young
ones,they attacked us k after an insolent and terri-
ble mannerand terrify d and wounded^ took and killed
us kf thousands, us who are thy people: Now as itis impossible that this should happen without Witchcraftand Enchantment, seeing the great Care that we hai
%aken to fortify our selves after an impregnable Man~
ner, for the Defence and Security of thy Name. Webeseech thee, *0< St. Nicholas, to tour champion,and the Bearer os our Standard) to be with us, botfy
in Peace and in War,and in our necessities,and atthe "time of our Death to protectus against this horrible
and tyrannicalcrewof sorcerers,and to drive them,
far enoughoff from our Frontiers, with the Recompeyct
yhuh they deserve* 'l '*"
It may be hoped I may give a better Account!
<pf Religion among Protestants than I have among
the Romanand Grecian Churches i" and I will, if in justice it is possible. * *
1 The next to the Nations I have been mention ingi I^ean; in Geographical Order, are those r
reformed Christians,' callM Lutherans j tov fay **
'^ '^ no
pp jfprfcpfthem, tlk Face of Religion indeed i§
altered much between these and the latter: But |
scarce know what Name to give it, at least as far
as I have enquired into it, or what it is like.
It was Popery and no Popery; there was the Con-
sul, but not the Transub,." The Service differed
indeed from the Mass, but the Deficiency seem'd
to be made up very much witli theTrumpets, Ket-
tle-Drums, Fiddles, Hautboys, &c. and all the
merry Part of the Popish Devotion; upon which ip
occurred* to me presently, that if there was no
Danger as Popery among the Lutherans, there was
Danger of Superstition; and as for the pious Part, I
saw very little of it in either of them.
By Religion therefore, the Readers desired to un-
derstand here^ not the Principles upon which the
several Nations denominate themselves so much,
as the Manner in which they discover themselves
to be sincere in the Profession which they make.
I had no Inclination here to enter into the Enquiry
after the Creeds, which every Nation profess'd to
believe; but the Manner in which they practised
that Religion which they really profess'd; for,
What is Religion to me without Practice? And
altho' it may be true, that there can be no true
Religion,* where it is not profess'd upon right
Principles; yet that which I observe here, and
which to me is the greatest Grievance among
Christians, is the Want of a religious Practice^
even where there are right Principles at Bottom,
and where there is a Profession ot the Orthodox
faith.
'In Brief, I am not hunting after the Profession
pf Religion, but the Practice: The first I find
almost in every Nation, Nulla gens tarn barbara —
But the last I am like to travel thro* the Histories
pf all Christendom "with [my Search, and per-
haps

haps may hardly be able, whca I have doaex m
jell you where it is.
All the Satyr of this Enquiry will look this
Way^ for where God has not. given a People
ihe Blessing *of a true Knowledge of himself, it
\vould cali for our Pity, not Reproach. It
would be a very dull Satyr indeed, that a Man
sliQLild be witty upon the Negroes in Africa for
not knowing Christ, and nos understanding the
Doctrine of a Saviours But if turning, to ,our
modern Christians of Barbadoes- and Jamaica for
pot teaching them, not instructing them, and
for refusing to baptize them there the Satyr
would be pointed and seasonable, as we (hall hear
farther by and by.
But to return iq the Lutherans, for there I am
supposed to be at this Time, I mean, among
she Coutts and Cities of ^rapdentiurg!?* Sqxo~
ny, &c I had Opportqnity here tp view a Courts

impossible to pursue ic with such an impetuous
Torrent of,thc Affections, without sacrificing all
things so ft/w|wh wjse M?n esteem more va-
luable,
JVbr was my Notion wrotjg; for the first thing
I found sacrificed, as I say? to tjiij voluptuous
Humour, was the Liberties, qf the People, who
being by Constitution orCustpm,rathf r under ab-
solute Government, and at the arbitrary WilJ
pf the Prince, are. sure to pay, pot all they can
spare, but even all they have, to gratify the unr
bouiided :Apf?etitpof a Court giycr| up to Plea-

[ 157 ]
By all I have read of the Manner of living there, both Court and People; the latter are
entirely given up to the former \ not by Ne-
cessity only, bnt by the Consent of Custom, and
the general Way of Management thro' the whole
Country-, nay, this is carry'd to snch a Height,
that as I have been told, the Kifig's Coffers are
the general Cess-Pool of the nations, whither all
the Money of the Kingdoms flow, and only dis-
perses again, as that gives it out \ whether by
running over or running out at its proper vent, I do not enquire; so that as all the Blood in the
human Body circulates in 24 Honrs thro" the
Ventricles of the Heart, so all the Money in the
Kingdom is said to pass once a Year thro' the
King's Treasury.
How far Poverty and Misery may prompt
7Piety and Devotion among the poor Inhabi-
tants, I cannot fay: But if Luxury and Gallan-
try* together with Tyranny and Oppression to
support it, can subsist with true Religion in the great Men, than for ought I know, the Courts of
Prussia and Dresden may be the best qualify'd in the
world to produce this Thing catl'd Religion,
which I have hitherto seen, is hard to be found.
It is true, that the Magnificence of the wisest:
King in the World in Jerusalem, was esteemed
the Felicity of his People: Bnt it seems to be ex-
press^ very elegantly, not as a Testimony of
, his Glory only, but of the flourishing Condition
of his People at the fame Time, under the pros-
perous Circumstances which his Reign brought
them to, vizThat he made Gold to be for Plen-
ty like the Stones in the Streets, amply expressing
the flourishing condition of his people under
him.

I have likewise m indeed, and heard much of
the same Kind of the King of Pwfjia^ and thateven from his own subjects, who were always full of the generous and truly roy al Qualities of that
Prince: He was the first King of the Country,' which before was a Dukedom br electorate only i
The Summ of thfexr Discourse is, That his Maje-
sty was so true a Father of hi$ Country And ofhii
People, that his whole care was the Flourishing
of thfcir Tirade, establishing their Photo engraving their Numbers planting s French,Swiss, and other Nations, among thfemy
to instruct and encourage them; and being noway!
Accessory to any of their Opprefljons, but relieving
and redreslihg all their grievances, as often and is soon a& they came to his knowledge And ihdeed, I could not but entertain a great
regard to the character of so just and good a
Prince. But all I could infer from that was, That
a Government may be tyrannical, and yet the
Can not be a tyrant,- but the grievances to the People are oftentimes much the fame: And every*
Administration, where the Constitution is thus
stated, as it seems to be in most, if not all of the
Northern Courts, Protestant aswfetl as others
seems inconsistent with the true Ends of Govern-
ment; the thing we call government was certain*-
ly established for - the l Prosperity of the people ;
Whereas, on the contrary, in all those
Courts, where I have made my' Cjbferf&tions, the
Magnificence of the Court, and th^ltCpe; ity of
the People, stand like the two Some what Ek-
fcess of Light you se<^ at one^ is exactly) bailfcfced by

And where, pray, is the religion of all this? That a whole Nation of People should appear
miserable, that their Governours may appear gay,
the
die people starve, that the Prince maybe fed*
br rather, the People be lean, that their Sovereign
may be fat; the Subjects sigh, that he may laught be empty, that he may be full and all this for
m$er luxury, not for the needful Defence of the
Governments resisting Enemies, preserving the
public peace, and the like but for meer Extra-
vagance, Luxury, and Magnificence, as in Prussia;
tor for Ambition, and pushing at Crowns, and the
Lust of Domination, as in Saxony.
But to come back to the religious Transactions
of these countries; How are the Ecclesiastics
jealous of their hierarchy, afraid to reform far-
ther, least, as they gave a mortal stabs to the
Perquisites and Vails of God Almighty's Ser-
vice in the Roman Church, modern Reformation
might give the like to them? Kor this Reason
they set a Pale about their Church, and there; as well as in other places, they cry to their
Neighbours, Stand off, lam holier than thou > and
with what Persecution and Invasion, persecuting
for religion, and invading the Principles of one
another. If there was any Peace among them; it Was thatonly which fajfes all Understanding. > It
presently occurred to me, what charity can there be, where there is no Peace? And what religion; where is no-€harity? And-I began to fear I should
find little of what I look'd for in those odd Cli-
mates.

Ifpund a World of Teachers here, but no body

Priests, aftd the Churches full of Women , But as
for religion,- I found most of the clergy were so far
from having much of it, that few of them .knew,
what if w.aS. Never Jure was a Nation so full of

I made fomeJEnquiry about Religion ,* and a-,
mong.the^est,' I happen'd to fall in company with
a good honest Hugonoc incognito^ and he^told me
very honestly, that the State of Religion in France
stood thus: Firsts That for some Years ago it was
put to the T§st by the King, and that was, when
the edicts cameout to banish and ruin, the, Hugo-
nots.; at which Time, said he, we thought there
had been a great deal of Religion in it: But really' when it tame to the Path, said he, itwas hard to
tell where we, should find it. The Persecution, as
it was thoughyft fi.rct, ^Would be ingrateful to the -
more religious Roman-Catholicks, and that some
would be/ouisd too good to do the Drudgery of
the Devi(: But nowhere mistaken^ th%-best fell

not do it, acknowledge they rejoie'd that it was ,

either had no Principle, or acted against Principle,
which is much at one. And as for us Hugonots*
says h$) we have shewn that we have no Religion
lost among us: For first, some run away for their Re-
ligion,andyet left it behind them,and we that stay'd
behind did it at the Price of our Principles: For now*
fays be,we are meer Hypocrites,neither Papists nor
Hugonots, for we go to Mass with Protestant
Hearts; and while we call our selves Protestants,
tore bow in the House of Rimmon,Whexe thct\,saidl,
is the Religion, once boasted of here, to be found?
Indeed, said hey it is hard to tell you, aud except a
little that-is in the Galleys, I can give you no good
Account of it* This indeed was confining the
Remains of a flourishing Church to about 350
Confessors, who really suffer'd Martyrdom for it,
for it was no less; so I minuted down French Reli-
gion* tugging at the Oar, and would have com£
away.
But it £imfe into my Thought to ask him, What
he meant by telling me, that those who run away
for their Religion out of France, left most of it
behind them? He answers I should judge of it
better, if I observed them when I eame. into my
own Country; where, if I found they liv'd better
than other People, or shcw'd any thing of Reli-
gion suitable to a People that sufter'd Persecution .
for their Profession, I fliould send Word of it; sot
he had heard quite otherwise of them, which
was the Reason why he and Thousands of others
did not fo|ipT^ them.
It hapip^pf*dj while I was warm it) my inqui-
ries thus after Religion, a Proclamation came
out in London, for appointihg a General Thanks-
giving, for a great Victory obtain'd by the Eng-
lish Forces and their Confederates, over the French
3t * r l>m . I care fc0t to put Names to the parti-
cular Times of things. M I starts
v
I Parted at the Noise, when they cry*d-it in tire Streets; Hah, said //-then I have found it at last;
and I rejbyc'd in particular, that having lookM so
much abroad for Religion, I should find it out
at home: Then I began to call myself a thousand
Fools, that I had not fav'd myself all this Labour,
and look'd at home first; tho' by'the By, I had
done no more in this than other Travellers often, or indeed generallydo, viz* go abroad to fee the
World, and search into the Curiosities of foreign
Countries, and know nothing of their own. ,
But to return to my Observations: I was re solved to fee the Ceremonies of this pious Piece of
Work; and as the Preparations far it were prodi-
gious great, I enquired how it wouldibe^ but no
i>ody could remember that the; like had ever been
in their time before: Every one said, it would
be very fine, that the Queen would be there her
self, and all the Nobility; and that the like had
never been seen since Queen Elizabeth's Time.
This pleased me ^exceedingly * and I began to
form Ideas in my Mind, of whar had been in for-
mer Times among religious Nations ,• I could
find nothing of what I was made to expect, unless
it was Solomon s Dedication of the Temple, or Jo-
fiah's Great Feast of the Reformation; and I .ex-
pected God would have a most royal, Tribute of
Praise. ,
But it shook'd me a little, that the People said
there had never been such a Thanfgiving since
Queen Elizabeth's time. What thought' I, can be
the Reason of that? and musing a little, Ol fats I
to myself, now I have found it t I suppose, ,no bo-
dy gives God Thanks in our Country, but Queens:
but this looked a little harsh ; and I n»ag*d our
Histories a little-for^my farther Satisfaction, hut
could make nothing of it; < At s talking*of it
to agbdd old Cavalier, that had been a Soldier
for King, Charles, O, A*, I can tell you the
Reason of "it:, They have never given thanks, sap
he, because they have had nothing to give TfratfKs
for. Pray, sap he, Wheii have they had an^ Vi-
ctories in Eti$(ind since Queen *Etiz,abeth>s'rTifnti

But whenI came 'to'thVPoint, the first thing I
#dbserv'H;^^ that nine Fa«s of ten of all the
*Comp^/bme there only to seethe Queen, and
the Show, and the other tenth Part,T think, might
be said to make the Show.
M z When
^Vhen the Queen came to the Rails, and de-
scended from her Coach, the People, instead of
crying out Hosannah, blessed be the Queen that
cometh in the Name of the Lord; I say, she PeO-
pse cry'd Murder, and Help, for God s sake;
treading upon one another, and stifling one ano-
ther, at such a rate, that in the Rear of the twa
Lines or Crowds qf People, thro* which the Queen
Pase'd,. it looked something like a Battle, where
the wounded weretretired to die, and to get Sur-
geons to come to them, for there lay Heaps of
Women and Children dragged from among the
Feet of the Cro?vd,> and gasping for Breath. I
went among some of them, and ask'd them, What
made them go into such a Crowd? And their An-
swer was all the fame, O Sir, I had a Mind to fee
the Queen, as the rest did.
Well, I had my Answer here indeed; for in
short, the whole Business of the Thanksgiving
without Doors, was to fee the Queen, that was
plain ; so I went away to my Scand, which, for
no less than three Guineas, I had secured in the
Church.
When I came there, it was my Fate to be pla-
ced between the Seats, where the Men of God
performs the Service of his Praise, and fung out
the Anthems and the Te Dmm^ which celebrated
the religious Triumph of the Day.
As to the Men themsel ves, I lik'd their Office,
their Vestments, and their Appearance ,• all look'd
awful and grave enough, suitable in some Respects
to the Solemnity of a religious Triumph and I
expected they would be as solemn in their Perfor-
mances, as the Levius that blow'd the Trumpets
at Solomon s Feaft, when all the People sliouted and
praised God*
But
But I observed these grave People, in the In-
tervals of their worshipping God, when it was
not their Turn to sing, or read, or pray, bestowM
some of the rest of their Time in taking Snuff, ad-
justing their Perukes, looking about at the fair La-
dies, whispering, and that not very softly neither
t6 one another, about this fine Lady, that pretty
Woman, this fine Dutchess, and that great For-
tune, and not without some Indecencies, as well
of Words, as of Gestures. Well, fays I> you are
none of the People I look for, where are they that
give God Thinks?
1 Immediately the Organ struck up for the7*jD*-
wn\ up starts all my Gentlemen, as if inspired from
above, and from their talking together, not over
modestly,fall to praising God with the utmost Pre-
cipitation, singing the heavenly .Anthems, with all
the'Grace and Music imaginable.
Itsthe Middle of ail this Musick and these exalted
things/' ju/fien J thought my Soul elevated with di-
vine Kfcefody* ^rid begap to be reconciled to all the
rest, I fqbsa little rustling Motion among the Peo-
ple9 as if "they had £>een disturbed or frighted
Some said it thunders some said the Church shook.
The true Business was, the Te Deum within wag
answer'd without fyy the Thunder of 100 Pieces
of Cannon, and the Kbise of Drums, with the
Huzza s and Shouts of great Crowds of People in
the-Streets. This I did not understand* so it did
neither disturb or concern me; I found indeed no
great Harmony in it > it bore no Consort in the
Music, least, as I understood it; but it was
over pretty soon, and so we went on.
* When the Anthem was fung, and the other Ser-
vices succeeded them, I that had been a little di-
sturbed with the lucid Intervals of the Choristers,
and the Gentlemen that fat crowded in with
M 3 them,
them, turned my JJj^s,toother Pl#pes>, in Uppes
| &ouldtsind some Sjt(n¥8t^ong the Crq\/yd, whose
Sods were taken up'with the exalte^ Raptures of
the Day.' \m\
.But alas,, it was #11 o^te, the La$es yere busy
singling out the Men, and the Mm the Ladies
The Star and Gatter pf $ fine young'Nobleman,
Jpe^tiful in Person, richijn Habit, ^and sparkling

rafter* ^Irew ^be Ey$s of so many, Women off of

to have been spoken to' by the Vergers, to have
withdrawn, out of the; Churclj, that he might
npt inj'ijir^ the Service^ apd rob God Alrn^ty pf
the ^brqage of the,t)4jh
As for the Que(en, ,h?r Majesty was tjip Star of
the Day, and infinitely .inppe Eyes were ^directed
to her than were lifted up, to Heaven, tho* the
last ^as the Business, pf the whole Proceflpidn.
SJ^UJafi I, this is mighty fine, that's true \
But wife's Religion of all this ? i Heavens
H£($m&tsaid,I, out of this Crowd, and Til ne-
ver wqci God any niote here, wh$n th$ 'Queen,

Queen* where th^ Queen is tp be segn?»but miift
they cope hither to prophane the Church with
her, ijnd mak<j thje Qyeen an Idol? And411 a great
Passion I was bqth at the People and atj the Man-
ner of the Day, a$ you may easily fee by what
follows,
MB-1 h^d made softie othetsatyrioal.Re^ctions
upon the CQnduct of the Day > but as, it looks
too near home, I am not willing, that ppor Ro-
binson Crusoe should disoblige any body.
I confess, the Close of the Day was still more
extravagant; for there the Thanksgiving was ad-
ipLjrned from tfhe $h\$ch to the 'favetn, and tQ
th?
the street; and instead of the Decency of a reli-
gious triumph there was indeed a triumph of religious indecency, and the Anthems TeX)eum
and Thanksgiving of the day ended in the DruiV- -
kennese, the bonfires, and the Squibs and Crac-
kers of the Street. How far Religion is concerned in all this, or
whether God Almighty will accept of this noisy
Doings for Thanksgivings that I have nothing
to do with; Let those People consider of it, that are
concern'd in it.
 
Of Differences in Religion.
|IS known alone to the Divine Wisdom,
why he has been pleased to'suffer any
Part of Religion, and the Adoration
paid to his Majesty, the Supplications
made to him, and the Homage which his Crea-
tures owe to his glorious Being, to be so doubt-
fully directed, or so differently understood by his
creatures, as that there should be any Mistakes or
disagreements about them.
How comes it to pass, that the paying a Re-
verence to the Name and Being of God, fhouM
not b^asfqa^apable of being disputed in the Man-
ner of it, as" in the thing itself? That all the rules of WorihippingjBelieving i.q, and serving the Great-
God of Heaven and Earth, should be capable 4df
being understood any more than one Way? And that
the Infallible Spirit of God, who is our Guide
M 4 tb
\
to Heaven, should leave any one of its dictates in # State of being misunderstood?
Why have not the Rules of Religion;, as well
those of doctrine as of Life, been laid down in
Terms so plain, and so impossible to be mistaken,
that all Men in the World in every Age, should
have the same ^Notions of them,asid understand them
in every Title of them exactly alike? Then as Hea-
vep is but one blesled great Port,at which all Hope
to arrive, there would have been but one Road
to travel the Journey in all Men would have gone
the fame Way, steer'd the fame Course; and
Brethren would no more have fallen out by the
.Way, v
God alone, who for wise and righteous Rea*
sons, because he can do nothing but what is wife
and righteous, has otherwise orders it, and that
is all we can fay of it: As to the Reason and Ju-
stice of it, that is a thing, of which, like as of *
the Times and of the Seasons, we may fay, Know-
fth no Man.
In the State of Uncertainty we ate now in, so
it is; two Men believing in the fame Gpd, holding
the fame Faith, the fame Saviour, the fame Do-
ferine, and aiming at the fame Heaven; yet can-
not agree to go to that Heaven, or worship
that God, ojr believe in that Saviour the fame Way,
or after the fame Manner: Nay, they cannot
know, or conceive of God, or of Heaven, or of the
Redeemer, or indeed of any one principle of the
Christian Religion, in the fame manner, or form
the fame ideas of those things in their Minds. It is true, the different Capacities and Faculties
of' Men, arp in Part a Reason for this;vby which
itis occasioned, that scarce two Men together
jbavethe fame potions and ApPrehensions even of
$ne andthe fame thing s their Understan-
dings
dings are led by different Guides, and they fee by
different Lights.
But this is not all; they are not alike honest to
the Light tney have; Three Men read the fame do ctrinal Article, fay it be of the Trinity, or of any
other, and they re examine the foundation of it in
the Scripture, One thinks verily he has found out
the Mystery effectually, goes op with his Enquiries,
and brings every Scripture and every Passage to
correspond exactly with his first potion; and thus
he confirms himself immoveably in his Opinion;
and it is so clear to him, that he can not only ne-
ver be argued out of it, but can entertain no good
Opinion of any Man, that conceives of it in any
other Way, but takes him for an Enemy to the
Orthodox, doctrine, and that he merits to be ex-
pend out of Christ's Church, deny'd the Christian
Communion; and in short, treats him with no Re-
spect, no nor thinks of him with Charity.
Anpther comes to the fame Scripture, and in
<juest of the fame Doctrine, and he reads over the
sajne Texts, and recieves Notions from them di-
rectly opposite to the other, or at least, very re-
mote from them: He follows in his search thro*
all the corroborating Texts, and is confirmed in
his first Opinion from them all: He grows as
immoveable in his received Construction of the
Scripture, as the other * and all is so clear to him, that he not only can never be argued out of his-
O pin ion, but can entertain no good Opinion of
any Man that conceives of it any other Way,
but takes him for . an Enemy to the Orthodox
Doctrine.
The third Man, he reads over all the fame
Texts of Scripture, but doing it with an Indiffe-
rency as to the substance, and whether he re-
ceives right information or no, truly he comes
away
way with a1 ^almnessofMind as to the substance ;
and as he went with no great Concern about being
certain, so tie comes back as uncertain as he went.
These three men are enough to fill the whole
World full of Disputes about Religion. The first
two meet, and being equally positive of their being
infallibly guided, equally warm in defending their
opinions, and equally tenacious ofthem,and above
all equally void of Charity to the otherm, truly they
fall out, Part, condemn, censure, revile, and as Op-
portunity and Power offers, at last, persecute one another, and all one anothdrs Adherents,
2 The third, half informed indifferent Man, he
comes in between these two, laughs at them both, fays they ard a Parcel of furious Christians, that
the thing is not absolutely necessary to be known,
that it is no Article of Faith, so as that with-
out deciding it, a Man cannot be saved ; says^
they are a parcel of Fools to fall out thus about
what they cannot be certaiirof, and which they
may go to heaven tho'they should not understand
it till they come there: And thus the World comes
to be divided.
Could they differ with Humility, they would,'
differ with charity ; but it is not to be,in Religi^
on, whatever it may be in civil or politick Affairs;
for there is a thing called Zeal, which Men call
a Grace in Religion, and esteem a Duty; and this makes Men fall-out in Religious Matters, with a
more fatal Warmth, and more Animosity, than in
other Cafes, according to Budibrafs. ' x'
"Zeal makes men fight like mad or drunk,
<c For Dame Religion as" for £unk.
Nor is this the Fate only of the Christian Religi-
on, tho5 'tis more sothere than in any othet; but 'tis
1 * , the
the same in other Cases, as between - the Persia^
apd the Turks, about the Successors of their Pro, phet Mahomet. It was so of Old between the
Heathen and the Jews: And the Assyrian Monarch
prepaid a fiery Furnace for those that would not fall
down and worship the great image that he had set
up.
In the Primitive Times of God s Church, the
Heathen did the like by Christians, and Christian-nos ad Leones was the common Cry: But when the
Church came to its Halcyon-Days, Constantinethe
Great gave peace to the Chrisiians,and it was but a
little While that they enjoyed that Peace, before
they fell out by the Way, the Arian heresies rose
up, and differing Opinions rent the State into Fa-
ctions, the Church into Schisms, and in the Space
of two Reigns, the Arians persecuted the Ortho-
dox, and the Qrthodox the Arians, almost with
the fame Fury as the Heathen had persecute c hem
both with before.
From thence tp our Time, Persecution has been
the practice even of all Parties, as they have been
clothed with power, and as their Differences have
mov'd them: for Example, in all the Christian
Countries, there? is a mortal Feud between Popish
and Protestant,- and tho' indeed the former have
carry'd their Zeal farthest, yet the latter have not
been able to fay they have not persecuted in their
Turn, tho' not with Fire and Faggot*
What Wars and Bloodshed molested Europe on
the Account of Religion in Germany? especially
till the general Pacification of those Troubles at
the Treaty of Westphalia? when the Protestants
having had the apparent Advantage of the War,
obtained the everlasting Settlement of their Religi-
pna as well as Liberties thro* the whole Empire.
Since
,(m ]
Since those times, what persecution in the faipe
Country, between' the Lutheran and Calvinist
Churches ? And how little charity is among them?
insomuch, that the Lutherans to this day wilsriot
allow the reformed Evangelick Churches, so the
Calvinistsarecallad,Liberty to assemble for worship within the Gates of their cities, or give them
Christian Burial.
I avoid looking too near Home> or fearchipg inScotland and England among the unhappy Divisi-
ons of Episcopal and Presbyterian, Church of Eng-
land and DiiTenter, and this I do, because it is at
Home: But it is too evident, that all these come
either from Mens being negligent of right Informa-
tions, or too tenacious when they have it; for *tis
£vi(tept, if all Men would be honest to the Light
they have, and favourable to their Neighbours,we
might hope, that how many several Ways forever, we chose to walk towards Heaven, we should all
meet there at last.
I look upon all the Seeds of religious Dissen-
tiop? $s Tares spw'd by the Devil among the
wheat : And it may be observed, that tho', as I
have already said3 the Assyrians persecuted the Jews,
and the Romans the Christians; yet where the
Devil is immediately and personally worshipped,
there we meet with little or no Persecution; for
Satan having a kind of peaceable Dominion iherV,
offers them no Disturbance: He desires no Inno-
vation for ever:; he finds the Sweetness pf it, ^nd
lets it all alone,
But if once they talk of OtherGods beforehim,he is far less easy; there he is continually sowing
Strife, and hatching Divisions among them for
like all other Monarchs,the Devil loves to reign
alone.
It would be too long a Task here, to reckon up
the several Sorts of Differences in Religion, even
among us in England > where, if two happen to
differ, presently like St. Paul to St. Peter, they
withstand one another to the Face; that is to say, car-
ry pn the Dispute to the utmost Extremity.
But there is another question before me, and
that is not only, Why there are such Differences
in the Points of Reiig'on? And, why are religi-
ous Differences hotter and more irreconcilable
than other Breaches? But, why are there more
Differences of this Kind among us, than among
any other Nation in the World?
Certainly this pushing on our religious Broils to
the Extremity, is the Peculiar of this Country of
England, and is not the fame thing in other places; and the variety is suchhere, that 'tis said, there
are more several Communions or Communities of
religious Kinds in England, than in all the other Protestant Countries in the World.
The best and most charitable answer that I
can think of to give for this, is to compliment our selves, and fay, 'tis because we are the most
religious Nation in the World ,• that is to fay,
that we in general set more seriously to work, to
enquire into the Substance and Nature of Religion;
to examine Principles, and weigh the Reasons of
things, than other People; being more concerned for, and anxious about, the Affairs of God, of
Heaven, and our Souls; that thinking, as we
ought to do, that religion is of the utmost con cern to us, and that it is of the last Moment to us
to be certain about it, and well grounded in the
Points before us,particularly whether we are rightly
informed or not; this anxious Concern makes us jea-
lous of every Opinion and Tenacious of our own,
breaks much in upon the Custom of submitting
our
our Judgments to the Clergy, as is the Cafe ih
Countries, where People are more indifferent in
their Search after these things, and more uncon-
cerned in the certainty or uncertainty of them-
I mull: acknowledge, that I think the true
and the only just Reason that can be given for this
Matter,4 is not, that jwe: are more furious
than other People, more censorious and raflifnotir
Judgment,- that we have less Charity, or less Pa-
tieftce5 in debating religious Points, than othet
People; But the truth is, tftat^we 'have'less in difference about them; and -we cannot sit down
contented with a Slight and overly Enquify, or a
cursory or School Answer to the Doubts in Que-
stion: But we make it a thing' of absolutes neceslr-
ty, to be fully informed of, and therefore are earv
best in the Enquiry, and knowing' the Scripture
s be the great Rule of Faith/ the Standard for
Life and Doctrine,' we flie thither and search for
Ourselves, not having Popery enough to expect; ah
infallible judge, not Indifference enough to acqui-
Pr esce in the judgment of the Clergy and perhaps ' a
little too tenacious of our own Interpretation;
even in things we are uninstructed' about.
* This indeed I take to be the true Reason why
religious Disputes encrease so much here, and why
there are such Separations and Schisms among us*
fctore than they are in any other 'Nation in the
World.
I know' much of it is laid to the Door of the Confusions they wererall in here, during the bloody
intestine wars in the Years 1640 to i6$6> and the Liberty given to all Opinions to set up themselves
at that Time: But I wave that as a'question that
tends to more Division. I believe, the Reason I
have given for it, stands as well grounded, and as
likely to be approved as any I can give, ot as any
that has been given in this Cafe.
There is another difficult question which still
remains before us; and that is, What Remedy
can we apply to this Malady? And first, I must
answer negatively; not to have us be less religious,
that we might differ less about it: But to have
us exercise more Chatity in our Disputes, that we'
might differ more like Men of Temper, and more
like Christians, than we do: This is striking at
the Root of religious Differences; for if they were
carry'd on mildly with a peaceable Spirit, willing
to be informed, & Disposition to Love as Brethren*
tho in every thing not like mindedt our variety of opinions would not then have the Name of
Differences, we should not separate in Communion
and in Charity, tho' we did not agree in every
thing we were to believe or not believe, about
Religion.
It is hard that we should say? these differences are the Consequences of a Nation, having more
Religion than their Neighbours, since we have
still this one Part too little; and as I suppose us
to have more Religion, I must be obliged to grant
we have not enough more i for if, as we have just so
much more Religion, as is sufficient. to make us
quarrelsome in religious Disputes; we had yet
as much more, as were sufficient to make us
peaceable*again after it, then we should be reli-
gious to Purpose.
So that, in a word, our being so religious, as
above, is only an unhappy middle Composition
between the enquiring and fully informed Christi-
an on one Hand, and the careless, indifferent, uri-
cbticern-d Temper, that takes up with any thing, oh the other hand :And this I take to be a just tho*
short;
ftort Account of our differencesin England ahui
Religion*
It might be a very useful question to start here,
namely where all our unhappy religious Differences
will end. I that am not willing to give the worst
hatur'd Answefc, where the best and kindest will
hold Water, ain for the present difpos'd to answer
in general,rather than descend to Particulars,™'*., in
Heaven: There all our unkind,unchr;stian, unneighr
bourlyAunbrotherlv Differences will end: We shall
freely' ihake Hands there with many a pardoh'd
Sinner jthat here we bid stand embrace many a
Publican,that hvere we think it a Dishonour to con-
verse with i see many a Heart that we have broken
herewith Censures, Reproachings, and Revilings,
made whole again by the Balm of the fame Re- ox blood; There we (hall fee, that there have been other
flocks than those of our Fold, other Paths tb
Heaven than those we shut Men out from; that those we have eifcommunicated have been taken
into that supetiSur Communion and those we
have placed at'our Left-hands, have been there sum-
ftion'd to the Right-hand i all Separations will
be there taken aways and the Mind of every Chrir
ftian be entirely reconciled to one another; no Di-
visions, no Differences, ho charging sincere Minds
with Hypocrisy, or embracing painted Hypocrites
for Saints,- every thing to be seen, and to be
known, as it really is, and by a clear Light \ none
will desire to deceive, none be subject tb be de-
ceived.
There we shall look upon all we have done and
said in Prejudice of the character of our brethren with a just Change, and sufficiently repair to one another all the injurious things we have said, or
indeed but thought of one gnother, by rejoicing
in the, common Felicity, and praising the sove-
reign glory, that had receiVd those we had foo-
lishly rejected, and let those into the same Heaven,
whorrTwe had ib the Abundance of our Pride, and
the penury of our Charity, sliut out.
/-How many actions of Mexn, which we, seeing
only their Out-fTde, have now censur'd, (hall we
'find there, by that PenetrsLtidii that cannot err, be
accepted for their in-side Sincerity? How "many
an Opinion, that we condemn here,J {hall we see
'then to bexOrthodqx ? * In a, Word, how many
contradicting Notions'and/Principles, which we-
'thought'inconsistent with true Religion, shall we
'find them to be reconcilable to themselves, to one
^another, and to the Fountain of truth ?
All the Difficulties in-our Conceptions of things
invisible, will then be explaiii'd; all the doctrines of the Immutability of the divine Councils will
then be reconcilable to the changeable Events of
things; &nd to the Varieties often happening in
at World: The Unchangeableness of the eternal
decrees, will then appear; and yet the 'Efficacy of
praying to God to do this, or not do that, to
pardon, forgive, spare, and forbear, which we
now fay is inconsistent with those unchangeable
Decrees, shall be reconcilable to that Unchange-
ableness, in a Manner to us now inconceiveable.
And this is the Foundation of what I now ad-
vance!, That in Heaven all our Differences in
religion will be rcconcil'd, and will be at an end. If any Man ask me, whether they cannot be ended
before? I answer, If we were all thoroughly con-
vinced, that they would be reconciled then, we
should certainty Put an End to them before; but
'tis impossible to be done, men's convictions of
the greatest and most certain Truths, are
not equal to one' another, or equal to the
N Weight
Weight and Sigilificancy of those Truths 5 and
therefore, such a general effect of this Affair can-
not be expected on this Side of Time.
There is one very great Reconciler of religious
Differences in this Wttrld, which has sometimes
been made use of by Providence to heal the breaches in Christian Charity among religious People; and
it is, generally speaking, very effectual: But it is
a bitter Draughts a Potion that goes down with
great reluctance, and that'is Persecution. This
generally reconciles the Differences of. Christians,
about the lesser matters in Religion: Thp Primi-
tive Churches, while under the Roman Persecutions,
had a much greater Harmony among themselves,
and very few Schisms and Divisions broke out a-
mong them. When they did differ in My Parti-
cular Points, they wrote healing Epistles to one
another, contended with Modesty and with Cha-
rity, and referr'd willihgly'thefr nations to be de-
cided by one another. They did not separate Com-
munion, and exComiriunicate whole Churches and
Nations, for a Dispute about the Celebration of
Easter, or unchurch one another for the Question
of receiving and re-baptifcifigof Peril tents, as was afterwards the Cafe. The Furnace of Affliction
burnt up all that Dross, the fury of their Perse-
cutors kept their Minds humble, their Zeal far Religion hot, and their affection for, and charity to one another encreasedas their Liberty, and their number was lessened.
Thus Bishop Ridley^ and Bishop Hooker; the first*
a rigid Church of England Bishop, the other, almost
a Presbyterian, or at least a Calvinist, like Peter
and Pafil, dffer'd hdtly^ and withstood one ano-
ther to the pact, in the very Beginning of the Re-
formation: But when they came to com fort their
I^digiofr, " Fire and Faggot ftew'd them the Re-
'- coticilablenefs
1
fconcileableness of all their Disputes; convinced
them, that it was possible for both to hold fast
the Truth in Sincerity, and yet entertain differing
, Notions of the Rites and Outfides of the divine
O Economy, and at the Stake they ended all their
sports writer healing Letters to end another*
and became Fellow-Martyrs and, Confessors for
that very Profeflion which was so intermixed with
Censure and Dislike before.
And let all that think of this remedy remem-
ber, that whenever these quarrelsome Christians
Comes by Persecution, or any other Incident, to
be thus reconciled in their charity, they find al-
ways itgreat deal to ask pardon of one another
* for, with respect to what is past all their Violence,
Heat of Zeal, and mudh more Heat of Paflfcn,
ill their breach of Charity, theit reproaches and
Censures, and hard Words, which have pass'd be-
tween them, will only then serve to bring them
together with moreAtfectibn, and to embrace more warinly } for, depend upon it, all the Diffe-
rences in religion among good men, (for I do
notmean Essential, DoSirinaly and Fundamental
Differences) serve only to make them all ashamed
of themselves at last.

Of: the wonderful Excellency of
Negative Religion^ and negativeVirtue*
 iL...
jEgative Virtue sets out like the .Phari-
see, with God I thank thee; 'tisaPiece
of religious Pageantry; a jointed Baby
dress'd up gay, but stript of its Gew-
gaws, it appears a naked Lump, fit only to please
Children and deceive Fools. Tis the hopeof the
hypocrite'sasCheatupon the Neighbourhood,
a Dress for without Doors, for 'tis of po Use
ttrithinj *tis a Mask put on for a character, and
as generally 'tis used to cheat others, 'tis so igno-
rantly embrace that we cheat even ourselves
with'it.
In a Word, Negative Virtue is Positive Vice, at
least when it is made use of in any, of the two last
cafes ; namely, Either as a Mask to deceive others,
or as a Midto deceive ourselves. If a Man were
to look back upon it, to fee in what Part he
could take up be Nest, or lay a% Foundation of
Hope for the Satisfaction of his Mind, as to fu-
ture things, he "w$fcld find it't$ie most uncom-
fortable Conditionjto go out of the World with,
that any Man in the World "can think.
The Reason is plain, compare it with the Pub lican, whom such a Man despises : Here is my
Landlord is a Drunkard5, t>ne of my Tenants is a
Thief, such a poor Man is a Swearer, such a rich
*" Man Man a Blasphemer, such a Tradesman is a Cheags
such a Justice of the Peace is an Atheist, such arakish Fellow is -turn'd Highwayman, such $
Beau is debauchM ; But I 1 I that am cloath'd
ib Negatives, and walk in the Light of my owr>
Vanity, I live a sober, regular, retired Life, lain
an honest Man : Vsie Page . I defraud n© body,
no Man ever heard me swear, of an ill Word
come out of my Mouth ; I never talk irreligiously
or prophanely, and I am never miss'd out of my
seat at Church, God I thank thee !I am not
debauched, I am no Highwayman, no Murderer,
&c* Now, what's the Difference of all these? I
must confess, speaking of all these together, and
pf what is usually the End of them, I think a
Man had better be any of them, nay, almost all of them together, than the Man himself; and my
Reason is3 in a few Words as follows:
All these know themselves to be wicked Per-
sons; Conscience, tho' for a Time oppressed and
kept under, yet upon all Occasions tells them plainly what their Condition is, and oftentimes
they repent. 'Tis true, sometimes they do not,
God is pleas'd sometimes to treat them in the
vindictive Attribute, and they are cut off in their
Crimes, insensible and stupid, without a* Space or
a Heart to repent ; and therefore, let none take
Hope in their profligate Living, from what I am
going to say.
Again; others, tho' they do repent, and God
is pleased to give them the Grace to return to
him as Penitents, come to it very late3 and some-
times'under a severe, Hand, as perhaps on a
Death-Bed, or under some Disaster, and often-
times at the gallows.But still I fay, those Men tho' they sin, they do
it as a Crime, and when they come to be told
N 3 * of
of it often, they are brought to repent: but the Negative Christian I speak of, is so full of him-
self, so perswaded, this: he is good, enough, and
religious enough already, that he has my Thoughts
of any thing, unless it be to pull off his Hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank him, that he
has no Nee£ of him; this is the Opiat that
doses his SquI even to the last Gasp; and it
is ten thousand to one, but the Lethargic Dr<?am
fliobts him thro- the Gulph at once, and he never
opens his Eyes till he arrives in that Light, where
$11 things are naked and open; where he sc^
tfoo late, that he has been a Cheat to himself, and
has been hurried by his own Pride in a Cloud of
negatives, into a'State of positive Destruction,
without remedy, I am reading no particular Man's Fate; God-
forbid I I restrain it to no Circumstances, I point
out no Persons; * tis too solemn a thing to make
it a satyr ; 'tis the State, not the Man, I speak
of; let the guilty apply it to themselves, and the
proud good Man humble himself, and avoid it.
1 I have observed, that many fall into this cafe by the excessive Vanity of being thought well of
by their Neighbours, obtaining a Character,^. *ti5
z Delusion very fatal to many Os good Name, is
indeed a precious ointment, and in some Cases
isbetter than Life: But with your Pardon, Mr.
Negative, it must be a good Name for good Deeds,
o? otherwise, a good name upon a bad Life is a
iaintedIVhore,thzthas a gay countenance upon a
rotten, diseased, corrupted Carcass.
Much to be preferr'd is' the general slander of a
pirejudifc'd Age, and a State of universal Calumny*
where theMind is free from theQuilt they charge 2
Such a man, tho' the world' s upon and despi-
ses him," looks in with Comfort, and looks ill' with hope. r —— Hie murus Aheneus esto>

General Contempt, universal Reproach, is a
Life that requires a world of Courage and
Steadiness of Mind to support: Bur, be this
my Portion in this World, with a Heart that does
pot reproach me with the guilt, much rather
than to be a Man of Negatives only, and who all
the World caresses with their good Wilhes, and
good Opinion, but is himself empty of real Vir-
tue, ^ Hypocrite at Bottom, a Cheat, and under
the delusion of it i whose Portion is with Hypo-
crites, and who can neither look in, or look up
with Pleasure, but must look without himself, for
• all that can be called Good, either by others, qc
by himself.
As at the Great and Last Day, the Secrets of
all Hearts Ihall be disclosed, so I am perswaded,
the opinion we have of one another here, will be
one of the Things which will be there, and per-
haps not till then fully rectify'd; and as we shall be there thorowly enlightened, we shall find Room
to see, that we have been much mistaken in our No-
tions of Virtue and Vice, Religion and Irreligion,
in the characters of our Neighbours. And I am
perswaded, we stiall seerpanyof our Acquaintan-
ces placed at the Right-hand of a righteous Judge,
whose characters we have oppressed with slanders, and who we have censoriously placed at his Left>x
hand here: And many a painted hypocrite, who
has insulted his Neighbour with, Stand off, I am.,
holier than tkou9 or whom he has turned from
N 4 witfy
with Disdain, and tfittua this PublkauV placed atthe-Lcfc-handi who-we made no Doubt we fiiousd
have seen at the Right-hand in Triumph.
This is a Support to the Mind of a good Man,
even when his Enemies, as David fays, $iajh upon
him *with their Teeth, "and 'have him in derision,that is to fay, when he is run down by universal
Clamour, and damn'd by the Tongues of Men,
even for this World and another, 4 '' *
Happy the Man, wfyo with exalted Soul,
- Knows how to rate' the great the pro/from Pool9
Who can the Insults of the' Street contemn, '1'
andvalues not the Rage or Tongues of Men?
Jie like the Sun exists on his own Flame,
andwhen he dies, is to himself a Fame.
But take this with you as you go, that as nega-
tive Praise will build no Man- Comfort, so nega-
tive Virtue will not support the Mind under uni versal Contempt. Scandal is much worse than
Slander; for the first isfounded upon real guilt, the other attacks Innocence. Nothing is 3, Scan-
dal, but what is true: Nothing is asSlander, but
what is false. . * • :'
He that fortifies himself against Reproach, must
do it^with a certain Reserve of Real, and solid Vir-
tue,-and Piety; it must be Uprightness and Inte-
grity that^must preserve him 'Wnothing but a Fund
of what is good can support the Mind under thtf
Reproach of being all that is bad ,1 do not mean
neither, 'that the Man must be perfect', havevno
Follibs or Failings, have made no Excursions, have
nothing to be laid to the Charge of his character i

Dick erson that is not, and never ^a$
to be 'found: but the' right Way of judging Men,
and the way which alone pan be just, is to judge
of them by their general conduct ; and so a Man
may in'his own Mind justly denominate himself:
As every^ good action does not denominate me
to be a good Man, so neither does every Failing,
every Folly, no nor every scandalous Action, der
dominate me a Hypocrite, or a wicked Man;
otherwise, some of the most eminent Saints in Scrip-
iure, and of every Age (since the Scripture was
written, are gone to the Devil; ^nd'twill be
hard to fay, there was ever a good Man in the
World.
But I return to my subject, the negative Good Man; and let me examine him a little in his just
character, in his conduct, publick and private:
He is no Drunkard, but is intoxicated with the
Pride of his own Worth: He is a good Neigh-
bour, a common Arbitrator and Peace-maker in
other Families, but a cursed Tyrant in his own.:
He appears in a publick Place of Worsliiprfor a
Show, but never enters into his Closet and shuts the Door about him, to pray to him that fees in
Secret: He is covered with the vain-glorious,
and ostentatious Part of Charity, but. does all his Alms before Men, to be seen of them:' He is migh-
ty eager in the Duties of the second Table, but re-
gardless of the first;' appearingly religious to be
seen and taken Notice ofby Men; but between
God and his own Soul, no Entercourse, no Com-
munication li What is this Man? And what Com-
fort is there of the Life he lives? He knows lit-
tle, or perhaps nothing of Faith, ' Repentance, and
a Christian mortified Life; In a Word, he is a,&!an perfect in the Circumstances of Religion, "Ul • - • * •' • 'and
and perfectly a Stranger to the essential Part of
Religion-"
Take this Man's* Conversation apart, enter into
the private and retired Part of it, What Notions
has he of mispent Hours, and of the natural Re-
flux of all our Minutes, on to the great Center and
Gulpfr of Life, Eternity? Does he know how to
put a right Value upon 7iW? Does he esteem it
the Use- Jilood of his Soul, as it really is, and act:
in all the Moments of it, as one that must ac-
count for them? Alas! this is of no Weight with
such a Man; he is too full of himself to enter in-
to any Notions about an Account, either for mir
spent Time, or any .thing else misdone; but per-
fwading himsclf,/that he never did any thingamiss,
entertains no. Notion of Judgment to come<> Eter-
nity, or any thing in it.
What Room has a Man to expatiate in
his Thoughts upon so immense and inconceivable
a Subject, as that of eternal Duration, whose
Thoughts are all taken up, and swell'd Top-full
with his own extraordinary self. It would be im-
possible for any Man in the World to entertain one
proud Thought of himself, if he had but one
right Idea of a future State. .Could such a Man
think, that any thing in him, or any thing he could
do, could purchase for him, a Felicity that was
to last to Eternity? What! that a Man should be ca-
pable in one Moment (for Life is not that in Length
compared to Eternity) to'do any thing for which he
Ihould deserve to be made happy to Eternity?
If then you can form no Equality between what
he can do, and what he shall receive -,less can it he
founded upon his negative Virtue, or what he has
forborn to do? and if neither his negative nor his
positive Piety can be equal to the Reward, and to
the Eternity that Reward is to last for j What
then is become em Pharisee ?- he must think no
more of himself, for all his Boasts j neither of his
negatives nor his Positives, but of a rich unboun-
ded Grace, that rewards according to itself, not
accojrdipg to what we can do; and that to be
judged at the last day according to our Works,
if literally understood, would be to be undone;
but we are to be judged by -the Sincerity of our
p.epentance? be rewarded according to the infi-
nite Grace of God, and Purchase of Christ,
with a State of Blessedness to an endless Eter-
nity.
Indeed this eternity is not a Meditation suita-
ble to the Man I -am talking of, 'tis a sublime
Thought,which his bloated Imagination has never descended to, or engag'd in; and when it comes,
he is like to have as little Comfort of it, as he has
had Thought about it. <
This Thought of Eternity raises new Ideas in
my Mind, and I cannot go forward without a
Digression upon so important a subject: ; if the
Reader approves the Thought, he will not quar-
rel about its being a Digression.

But: tb the Purpose in Hand fat I have not
done with this Man of Negatives yet: And now
tefrjas bring hip more nearly and seriously to a
Converse with the invisible World: ftp looks in-
to it with Horror and dreadful ApprehefisionS; as
Fœlixywhcxt StPaul reasoned of Temperana^Righ-
teousnese, and of Judgment to eomc. Fœlix, was
a moral
^mortl Heathen, that is to fay, a Man df Nega-
tives, like him I am speaking of. What was
then the Cafe? he trembl'd; Pray, what is it rea-
sonable to think Fœtix trembled at ? if I may give
my Opinion, who am but a very mean Expositor
of Texts, it was this or something like it.
Fœlix was a Philosopher, a$ well as a Man of
tower; and by his Wisdom, as also by his Reve-
rence of the Gods, \Hiieh at that Time was the
Sum of Religion, had been a Man of Morals, a
Man that had practiced Temperance and Righte-
ousness, as the life which was unquestionably to
be rewarded by the Powers above, with an Ely*-
sian Felicity; that is to fay, according to the jRp-
man Maxim, That the Gods were the Rewarders
of Virtue.
But when the blessed Apostle ca*ne to reason
with Fœlix, how unlikely it was3 that these Ne-
gatives should purchase our Happiness hereafter,
he £bew*d him, that'the Gods could not be in Debt
to us for the Practice of Virtue, which was indeed no
more than living most suitable to our Reason*
that a Life of Virtue and Temperance was its own
Reward, by giving a healthy Body, a clear Head,
a composed Life, &c. fitting the Man for all
other worldly Enjoyments, adequate to his Rea-
son, and his present Felicity as a Man: But
eternal Happiness must come from another Spring,
namely from the infinite unbounded Grace of a
provoK d God, who having erected a righteous
Tribunal, where every Heart should be searched,
and where every Tongue would confess itself guil-
ty, and stand self-condemns. Jesus Christ, whom
Paul preach'd, would separate such as by Faith and
Repentance he had brought home, and united to
bimself by the Grace of Adoption, and on the
Foac
Foot of his having laid down his life a Rattfoth
for them, had appointed them to salvation. When poor negative Btlix heard of this, ^and that all his philosophy, his temperance, and
Righteousness, if it had been ten thousand times as great, could rtcigh nothing, and plead nothing
for him at that Judicature; and that he began to
fee the Justice and Reason of this for Paul rea-
soned him into it; I fay, when he saw this, he
trembled indeed, as wellhfc alight, and as all ne-
gative People will.
What a strange idea must that Pharisee have of
God, who went up with the Publican to the Tem-
ple to pray : 'Tis observable, he went with a good
Stock of Assurance in his Face, that could come to
the Altar, as he did, not to offer any> Sacrifice; we
don't find he carry*d any Offering, or bespoke
the Priest to make any Attonement; he wanted no
Priests to make any confession to: Good Man, as
he thought he was, he had no Sins to confess;
h& rather came up to the Altar to even Accounts
with Heaven; and like the other man in the Gos-
pel, tell God, that he had fulfilled the whole Law,
and had done all those things that were command- ed,even from his Youth so, as before, he only pul-
led off his Hat to his God, and let him know,
that there was nothing between them at present,
and away he goes about his business. But the poor Wretch, whom he despis'd, and
whom he had left behind him, for he durst come no
farther, acted quite another Part. He had at first
indeed, in Sence of his Duty, resolvM to go up to
ti)e Temple; But when he saw the splendor and
majesty of God represented by the Glory of that
elevated Building; I say, when he saw that, tho
a great Way off,, and then looked into his-own
Heart, all his negative ^Confidences failing him.
i ml
&hd a Sense of miserable Circumstances corfting1
upon him, he stops short, and with a Blow of Re-
flection and perfectly unmixt with any of the Pha-
risees Pride3 he looks down in Humility, but lifts
up his Heart in a penitential Faith, with a Lord be
merciful to me a Sinner.
Here was Faith, Repentance, Duty, and Con-
fession, all conjoined in one Act, and the Man's
Work was done at once, he went away justified$
when the negative Pharisee went home, the same-
self vain Wretch, that he came out with God I
thank thee in his Mouth, and a Mass of Pride in
his Heart, that nothing could convince, In what glorious Colours do the Scriptures up-
on all Occasions represent those two Hand in Hand
Graces, Faith and Repentance?There is not one
Mention of Faith in the whole Scripture, but
what is recommending some Way or other to our
Admiration, and to our practice 'tis the Foun-
dation and the Top-stone of all Religion, the
Right-hand to lead, and the Left-hand to support*
in the whole Journey of a Christian, even thro* this
World, and into the next: In a Word, *tis the "
Sum and Substance of the Gospel Foundation.
Religion seems to have been founded upon three
Establishments in, the World* in all which the
terms of Life are laid down at the End of our
acceptance of it.
The First Establishment was with Adam in Far
radife $ the Terms of which were, Forbear and
live.f -
The Second Establishment was with the Child dren ofIsrael, in the giving of the Law; the Terms
of which were, D o and live.The Third Establishment is that of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ j the Terms of which are, Bblievb
andUvi*
0 Sq
-  So that in a Word, Faith is the Substance
.and fulfilling of a Religion, the Plan of
.Righteousness* /and the great Efficient of eter-
nal Life. Let me break out here upon this glo-
rious Subject, and pardon the Excursion, I en-
treat you.

If all this be to be said, and all indeed but a Poe?

in all our Negative Religion* \ ':

his Death-bed, and there having very little other. Notion of Religion; for 9tis the fate of those
that trust to their negatives, to have little else ct *
their ThoughtsHa Isa good Man come to talk with, him, if he talks, out of that way, he puts him all
into Confusion; for if he cannot swim upon the
Bladders of his negatives, he drowns immediate-
ly, or he bouys himself up above your Reproofs,
and goes on as before: He is a little like the Po-_
Ush Captain Vr(it^ who was executed for the Mui> ,
ther of Mr. Thyme, who, when they talk to him
of Repentance, and of Jesus Christ, said, he was
ofsuch and such a Family, and he hop'd.Godwould
have some Respect to him as a Gentleman.

filled with better ..Principles, prays for this* vain glorious Man? Must he fay, Lor^ accept this,*

custom of the Times to be; Nor has he shown bad Examples to others; Lord be merciful to this
excellent Good Man?
No, no, the poor sincere Miuister knows better
things i and if he prays with him, he turns him
quite in-side-out, represents him as a poor mista-

and has nothing in himself, but calls himself en-
tirely, as a miserable lost Sinner, into, the Arms*,
of a most mere sal Saviour, praying to be accepr
ted on the Merits of Jesus Christ, and no other;
so that there's all his Negative Bottom unra-

Chap. V.
Of tistning to the Voice of Pro.
v I D e n c E9
E are, naturally backward to inform
our selves of our duty to our Ma ker, and to our selves; 'tis a Study,
we engage in with great reluctance, and *tis but too agreeable to us,
"when we meet with any difficulty which we think gives us a just Occasion to throw
off any farther Enquiries of that kind.
Hence I observe the wisest of . Men often run
into mistakes about the Things, which speaking
of religion we call Duty, taking up flight Notions
of them, and believing they understand enough of
them > by which they rob themselves of the Ad-
vantage, as well as Comfort of a farther search.
Or on the other hand, taking up with the gene-
ral Knowledge ~of religious principles, and the
common Duties of a Christian Life, are satisfy'4
with knowing what they fay is sufficient to carry
them to heaven, without enquiring into those
Things which are helpful and assistant to make
that strait Path easy and pleasant to themselves;
and to make them useful to others by the Way.
Solomon was quite of another Opinion, when
he bid us cry after knowledge,and lift your Voice
for
 
jfbr Understanding; dig for her as forsilver,and search» j or her as for hid treasure.It is certain here that he
meant religious Knowledge ; and it is explained
in the very next Words, with an encouraging Pro-
mise to those that stall enter upon the search, (viz.)
then(shaltthou understand the Fear of the LO RD$
and find the knowledgeof G 0 D.
I am of Opinion that it is our unquestioned
Duty, to enquire after every Thing in our Jour-
ney to the eternal habitation which God has
permitted us to know, and thus to raise Difficul-
ties in the Way of our just search into divine Dis-
coveries is to zfi,\ikz Solomon's Sluggard,who faith,
there Is a Lion without, I shall be. Painin the Streets,
Prov. xxii13. that is, he sits down in his Ignorance
repulsed with imaginary difficulties,without making
one Step in the search after the Knowledge, which
he ought to dig for, as for hid treasure.
t .Let us then be encourag'd to our Duty; let us
boldly enquire after every Thing that God has
permitted us to know I grant that secret Things
belong to God, and I stall labour to keep my due
Distance. But I firmly believe, that there are no
secret; Things belonging to God, and which
as such we are forbidden to enquire into, but what
also are so preferv'd in Secrecy, that by all our
Enquiries we cannot arrive to the Knowledge of
them * and it is a most merciful, as well as wife
Dispensation, that we are only forbid enquiring,
after these Things which we cannot know; and
that all those Things are effectually locked up from
our Knowledge, which we are forbidden to en-
quire into. The Case is better with us, than it was with Adam..We have not the Tree of Know-
ledge first planted in our View, as it were tempts
- ing us with its Beauty, and within our Reach,
and then a Prohibition upon Pain of Death: But
blefled
bleflfed be God, we may eat of all the Trees in the Garden; and all those of which we are not
allowed to take, are placed both out of our Sight,
and out of our Reach.
I am making Way here to one of the Trees of
sacred knowledge, which tho' it may grow in the
thickest of the wood and be surrounded with
some Briars and Thorns, so as to place it a little
out of Sight; yet I hope to prove* that it is our
Duty to taste of it; and that the Way to come at
it, is both practicable and plain.
f But to wave the Allegory, as I am entring into
the nicest Search of divine things, that perhaps the
whole Scheme of Religion directs us to; >tis ab-
solutely necessary at our Entrance, if possible, to re-
move every Difficulty, I explain every Principle,
and lay down every Foundation so undeniably
clear, that nothing may appear dark or mysterious
in our first Conceptions of things $ no stumbling- block lye at the Thresliold, and the humble Rea-
der may meet with no Repulse from his own Ap-
prehensions, of not understanding what he is going
to read.
'Listening to the voiceof Providence, is my - Subject:
I am willing to suppose in the first Place, that I am
writing to those who acknowledge the two grand
principles upon which all Religion depends. I, That there is a God, a first great moving Cause
of all things, an eternal Power, Priory and conse-
quently Superior to all Power and Being' s. That
this eternal Power, which I call God, is the Crea-
tor and Governour of all things, of Heaven
and Earth.
'To avoid needless Distinctions concerning which
of the Persons in the Godhead, are exercised in the
creating Power, and which in the governing power* J offer that glorious Text, Psalm xxxiii. 6. as a
\ Repulse
Repulse to all such cavilling Enquiries, where the
whole Trinity is plainly entitled to the whole
creating work* by the Word (Godthe Son) of the
Lord (Godthe Father) were the Heavens made,
and all the Host of them, by the Breath (God the
HolyGhost) of his Mouth.
Having thus presupposed the Belief of the Being,
and the creating Work of God, and deelar'd, that
ii am writing to such only, who are ready to own,
they believe that God is, and that he created the
Heaven, and the Earth, the Sea, and all that in
them is. I think I need not make any Preamble,
to introduce the following Propositions, viz*
I. That this Eternal God guides by his Provi-
dence the whole world,which he has created by his
Power*
\ 2. Thatthis Providence manifests a particular Care
over, and Concern in the governing and directingMan%
the best and last created Creature on Earth.
Natural Religion proves the first, revealed Reli-
gion proves the last of these beyond Contradiction.
Natural Religion intimates the Necessity of a Pro-
vidence guiding and governing the World, from
the Consequence > of the Wisdom, Justice, Pre-
science, and Goodness of the Creator.
It would be absurd to conceive of God exer-
ting infinite Power to create a World, and not
concerning his Wisdom, which is his Providence,
in guiding the operations of Nature, so as to pre-
serve the Order of his Creation, and the Obedi-
ence and Subordination of Consequences and Cases throughout the Course of that Nature,
which is in Part the inferior Life of that Cre-
ation.
Reveal'd
&e<ueatd Religion has given such a Light into ttik
Care and Concern of this Providence in an espe-
ciabManner,[in and over that Part of the Creation
called Man, that we must likewise deny Principles,
if we enter into dispute about it.
For him the Peace of the Creation is preserv'd,
the Climates made habitable, the Creatures subje~
cted and made nourishing, all vegetative Life made
medicinal]; so that indeed the whole Creation seems
to be entailed upon him as an Inheritance,and aired to him for a Possession, subjected to his authority, and governed by him,as Viceroy to the King of all
the Earth ; the Management of it is given to him as
Tenant to the great Proprietor, who is Lord of
the Mannor^ or Landlord of the Soil And it can
not be conceived, without great Inconsistency of
Thought, that this World isle ft entirely to Man's
conduct without the supervising Influence and
the secret Direction of the Creator.
This I call Providence> to which I give the whole
Power of guiding and directing of the Creation,
and managing of it, by Man who is his Deputy
or Substitute, and even the guiding, influencing*
and over-ruling Man himself also.
Let critical Annotators enter into specifick Di-
stinctions of Pn>videiice, and its Way of acting,
as they please, and as the Formalities of the School*
men direct. The short Description I shall give of
it is this, That it is that Operation of the Pow^
er, Wisdom, Justice, and Goodness of God, by
which he influences, governs, and directs, not on-
ly the Means, but the events of all things, which
concern us in this World.
I fay, it is that Operation, let, them call it what
they will, which acts thus; I am noway concerted
to shew how it acts, or why it acts thus and thus
in particular; we are to reverence its Spvereignty,
Us it is the finger of God himself, who is the fcr
vereign Director, and we are to observe its Mo*4
tions, obey its dictates, and listen to its Voice, as
it is, and because it is particularly employ'd for
our Advantage.
It would be a very proper and useful Qbserva^
tion here, and might take up much of this work* to illustrate the goodness of Providence, in that it
is,* as I fay, particularly employ'd for the Advan-
tage of Mankind: But, at this is not the main Design, and will come in naturally in every Part of
the Work I am upon, I refer it to the common Con serene es, which are to be drawn from the Particu-
lars, as I go on.
It is indeed the most rational Foundation df the
whole Design before me; 'tis therefore that we
should listen to the voiceof Providence, because it is
principally determined, and determines all othet
things for our Advantage.
But I return to the main subject, "the voiceof
Providence^ the Language or the Meaning of Prom vidence.
Nothing is more frequent, than for u& to ttiistake
providence, even in its most visible Appearances:
How easy then must it be, to let its sifent Actings*
which perhaps are the most pungent and significant*
pass our Obfervatidn.
I am aware of the error many fall into, who determining the universal Currency of Events to
Providence,and that not the minutest thing occurs
in the Course of Life, but by the particular Desti-
nation of Heaven, by consequence entitle Provi-
dence to the Efficiency of their own Follies as
if a Person, presuming to smoke his Pipe in a
Magazin of Gun-Powder, should reproach Provi-
dence with blowing up the Castle/ for which in*
deed heought to be hanged; ofa man leaving his

Xvere in Danger of drowning in a shipwrecked. ~
Vessel, and Providence presented a Boat coming
towards him, he would scarce want to be, told,
that it was his Business to make Signals of Distress,
that the People in the- said Boat might not pass
by ignorant of his Condition, and give him no
Assistance.; if he did, and omitted it, he would
have little Cause to concern Providence in his
Ruine. ^
There is certainly ayRebellion against Provi-
dence, which Heaven itself will not always con-
cern itself .to over-rule; and-he that throws him-
self into a River to drown himself, he that hangs
himself pp to a Beam, Jhe that (hoots himself into
the Head with a Pistol, shall die in Spite of all
the Notions of Decree, Destiny, Fate, or what
ever we weakly call Providence; in such Cases,
Providence will not always concern itself to pre-
vent it; and yet. \is no Impeachment of the So-
vereignty .of Heaven, in directing, decreeing, and
governing ail Events in the World. ^
Providence decrees, shatÆvents shall attend up-
on Causes in a direct Chain, and by an evident
Necessity, and has doubtless left many Powers of
Good and Evil* seemingly-to our selves, and, as
it were, in our Hands, as the natural Product of
such Causes and Consequences, which we are not
to limit, arid cannot expressly determine about,
but which we are accountable for the good or evil
Application of; otherwise we were in vain ex-
horted and commanded,to do any goodithing, or
to avoid any wicked one: Rewards and Punisti-
P a ments
ments would be incongruous with sovereign Justice $
and Promises, and'Threatnings, be< perfectly un-
meaning useless things, Mankind being no free
Agent to himself, or entrusted with the necessary
Powers, which those-Promises and Threatnings
imply*
But all these things are out of my present En-
quiry; I am for freely and entirely submitting all
events to Providence; but not to be supinely and
unconcernedly passive, as; if there was nothing
warning, instructing, or directing in the Prerngni*
tions of God's Providence; and which he expe-
cted we should take Notice of, and take Warning
by. The prudent Man forefeeth the Evil, and
hideth himself: How does he foresee it, since 'tis
not in Man to direct himself? There are Intima-
tions given us, by which a prudent Man may, some-
times foresee Evil, and hide himself; and I must
take these all out of the Devil's Hands, if possi-
ble, and place Providence at the Head of the in-
visible World, as well as at the Helm of this
World; and tho' I abhor superstitious and scepti-
cal notions of the World of Spirits,. of which
I purpose to speak hereafter, either in this Work*
or in some other by itself; I say, tho' I am not at
all a Sceptick, yet I cannot doubt, but that the
invisible . Hand of Providence, which guides and
governs this World, does with a secret Power like-
. wise influence the World,, and may,, and I believe
does, direct from thence silent-Messengers on many
Occasions, whether sleeping or waking, whether
directly or indirectly, whether by Hints, Impul^
ses, Allegories, Mysteries, or otherwise, we know
not; and does think fit to give us such Alarms,sueh
previous and particular Knowledge of things,
that if listened to,4 might* many Ways be useful to
v.
the prudent Man to foresee the Evil, and hidc
himself. - Thp only objection, and which I can fee no
Method to give a reason for, and no Answer to,
is, Why, if it be the Work of Providence, those
things should be so imperfect, so broken, so irre-
gular, that Men may either never be able to Paris' s right judgment of them, as is sometimes the
Cafe, or make a perfect Judgment of them, which
is often the Cafe, and so the End of the Intima-
tion be entirely defeated, without any Fault, Ne-
glect, or omission of the Man.
This we can no more account for, than we
can for the Hand-writing upon the Wall at the
great Feast of Belshazzar,viz,, why it was writ-
ten in a character, which none could understand;
and which, if the Prophet had not been "found, had perhaps never been known, or at least, not till
the King's Fate, which was even then irretrieva-
ble, had been over.
This, indeed, we cannot account for, and can
only fay, 'tis our Duty to study these things, to listen
to the Voice of them, and obey their secret Acctates, as far as Reason directs, without an over
superstitious Regard to them, any more than a
total neglect, leaving the Reason of Providence's
acting thus, to be better understood hereafter.
But to describe a little what I mean by Listen-
ing to the Voice of Providence; it is the Reverse
of the supine stupid Man, whose character I shall
come to by and by. The Man I would recom-
mend, lives first in a general Belief, that Provi-
dence has the supreme Direction of all his Affairs,
even of his in particular, as well as those of the
World j that 'tis his Mercy that it is so, that 'tis
the effect of an infinitely wife and gracious Difpo-
(itipn from above, that he subsists; and that u, .. , P 3 not
s
Oh ]
not below the Dignity any more titfan.'tis remote
from the Power of an infinite, wife, and good
Being, to take cognizance of the least thing con-
cerning him..
This in the Consequence obliges him to all I
fay, for to him who firmly believes, that Provi-
dence stoops to concern itself for him, and. to or*
der the least Article, of his Affairs, it: necessarily
follows, that he should concern himself in every
thing that Providence does, which comes withinhis
reach,that he may know whether he be interested
in it or no.
If he neglects this, he neglects himself; he a-
t>andons all Concern about himself, since he does
not know, but that the very next particular act of
Providence, which comes within his Reach to
distinguish, may be interested in him, and he
in it, It is not for me to dictate here to any Man,
what particular things, relating to him, Providence
is concern'din, or what not; or how far any In-
cident, of Life is or is not the particular Act and
Deed of the Government of Providence: But as
it is the received Qpinion of every good Man, that
nothing befalls Us without the active or passive
Concern of Providence in it; (o it is impossible
this good Man can be unconcerned in what-'
ever that Providence determines concerning
him, If it be true, as our Saviour himself fays, 7%at
not a Hair falls from our Heads without the Will of
our heavenly, Father, then not a Hair ought to fall
from our Heads, without our having our Eyes up
to our heavenly Father in it.
I take the Text in its due Latitudc3 namely,
that not the minutest Incident of Life, befalls us
without the "active Will of our Father directing it,
or the passive Will of our Father suffering it, so
I take the deduction from it in the same latitude; that nothing of how mean 'a nature soever c^a
befal us, but we ought to have our eyes up to
our :heavenly 'Father in it, be TesignM to him in
the Event, and subjected"to him in the Means;

of all Things belonging to u% I dare not pxgludp
qt from haying some Concern, frow much 1 do notsay,
\n these Things also: But of this in its Place.
Whenever Providence discovers any. thingtof this
xArcanum? I desire to listen tq the Voipe of it; and
this is one of tfre Things I recommend %o others:
Indeed I wouI4 be yery cautiqus, how I listen tp
any other Voices from that Country," than such as \
ai# sure are conveyed to me from Heaven for my
better understanding th? whole Mystery.
'If then -we are to listen tp the Voice of N^ture,and
to the Vojf e$ of Creatures?<z//&. to the Vpice of the
'Invisible Agents of the World of Spirits as abovp,
much rnore are we to listen to the Voice of God.
I havf already hintecj that he that, made th?
World, iv? are Jhre guides it, and his Provi-
dence js equally wonderful'" as his. Power: But no-
thing in the 'whple Course of his Providence [if
more Worthy our Rggard, especially as'it con-,
ferns iis his Creatures, than th^ silent Vpice, if if
qqay b$ allowed m$ to call it so, of his managing
fivent? and Causes; h? that listens to the Provi-
de? of God0 listens to th$ Vpice of £!od.
as he is seen in the wonders of his Governments
and as he is seen in the Wonders of his Omni-
potence.
If then the Events of Things are his, as well
as the Causes, it is certainly well worth our
Notice, when the Sympathy or Relation between
Events of Things and their Causes, most emi-
nently appearso" and how can* any Man, who has
the least inclination to observe what id remarka-
ble in the World, sliut his Eyes to the visible
Discovery, which there is in the events of
Providence, of a supreme Hand guiding "them;
tor Example, when visible Punishments follow Vi-
sible Crimes, who can refrain confessing the appa-
rent Direction of supreme justice? WhenConcur^
rence of Circumstances directs to the Cause,
Men that take no Notice of such remarkable
paintings of Providence, openly contemn Hea-
ven, and frequently stand in the Light of their
own Advantages.
The Concurrence of Events, is a Light to
their Causes, and the Methods of Heaven in
some Things, are a happy Guide to us to make a
Judgment in others; he that is deaf to these
Things, shuts his Ears to Instruction, and like
Solomon'sFool, haw knowledge.The Dispositions of Heaven to approve or con-
demn our, Actions, are many of , them discovered
by Observation; and ycis easy to know, when that
Hand of Providence opens the Door for, or
stints it against our Measures, if we will bring
Causes together, and compare former things with present, making our Judgment by the ordinary
Rules of Heaven's dealing,with Men.
How, and from what Hand come the frequent
instances of severe Judgment, following rash and
hellish Imprison when Men call for God's
[zi8']
Judgment; and Providence, or Justice, rather
obeys the Summons and comes actheir call: A
Man calls God to Witness1 to an Untruth, and
withes himself struck dumb, blind, or dead if it
is not true ; and is struck dumb, blind, or dead;
is not this a 'Voice, does not Heaven with the
Stroke, cry, Castrgo te, Be it to thee as thou hast
said: He must, be deaf who cannot ;hcar it, - and
worse than deaf that does not heed it,4 such Exe-
cutions from Heaven are in TWwrem, as offenders among Men are - punished as. well for Example to
others, as to, prevent their doing the like again.
; /Innumerable Ways' the merciful Disposition of
Providence takes to' discover to us, what he Ex-
pears we should do in difficult Cases, and doubtless
them: it expects at the fame Time we should take
Notice of thoso<Diirections: •
We are short-sighted Creatures at best, and can
fee but a little Way before us, I mean as to the E-
vents of Things we ought therefore to make life
of all the Lights and Helps we can get; these if
nicely regarded, would- be some of the most con-
fidcrable to guide us in many difficult Cafes.
Wfould we carefully listen to the Concurrence v
of Providence*, in the several parts of our Lives,
we should stand in less need of the more danger'
tpus Helps of Visions, Dreams, and Voices,
from less certain Intelligences. ' -:
k A Gentleman of my Acquaintance, being to'
go a journey into the Norths was twice- ta-
ken very ill the Day he had appointed to begin his'
Journey,and fo.was Oblig'd to'pu£off poin;g; this he
f ook for a Direction from Heaven, -that he should not go at all; andin very few Days after, his Wife
was'taken sick and died, which made it absolutely
necessary for him, to be at home, to -look after
x •' -  * his
his Affairs, and had he gone1 away before, must
certainly have been obliged to come' back again.
. The Romans had certainly the Foundation of f
this Principle, in their prudent Observation of
Days and Circumstances of Days; nor is Scrip-
ture it {elf void of the like, but rather points out
to the Observation, particularly that of the Chil-
dren of Israel who after 430 Years were expired
from their coming into Egypt,Even in the selfsame Day departed they thenceExod. 12, 41,42*
This is the Day, that remarkable Day, several
other Scriptures mention periodical Times, dies
Infaufius, the prudent (hall keep Silence in that
Time \ for it is an evil time.We find Providence stoops to restrain not the A-
ctions of Men only,but even its own actions to Days
and Times; doubtless for our Observation, and in
some Things for our Instruction's' I do not
so much refer to the Revolutions of Things and
Families on particular Days, which are there-
fore by'some People called lucky and unlucky
Days, as I do to the observing, how Providence
causes the Revolutions of Days, to form a
Concurrence between the Actions of Men, which
it does not approve or does approve, and the Re-
ward of these actions in this World; by which
Men may if they think fit to distinguish, and ob-
serve right upon them, see the Crime or Merit
of those actions in the divine'Resentment, may
read the Sin in the Puniflimeht, and may learn
conviction from the Revolution of Circumstances
in the Appointment of Heaven.'
I have seen several collections of such Things
made by private Hands, some relating to Family
Circumstances,sorrie to Public; also in the unnatural
Wars in England,betvrœn the King and the Parlia-
ment, J have heard many such things have been ob-
. serv'd 1
etvM: For example, the same Day of the Year
and Month, that Sir John Hot ham kept out Hull ar
against King Charles the ist, and refused him En-
. trance, was the fame Sir ^fohri Hotham put to
Death, by the very Parliament that he did that
Exploit for; that King Charles himself was
sentenced to die, by the high Court of Justice, as
it was then- called, the fame Day of the Month,
that he ftgn'd the Warrant for the Execution of
the Earl of Strafford, which as it was then said by
some of his Friends, was cutting off his own
Right-hand. , The fame Day that King James
the 2,d came to the Crown against the Design cf
the Bill of Exclusion, the fame Day he was voted
Abdicated by Parliament, and the Throne fill'd
with the Prince of Orange and his Princess.
These, or such as these, seem to, be a kind of
silent Sentence of Providence upon, such Actions,
animadverting upon them in a judicial Manner,
and intimating plainly, 'that the Animadversion
had a retrospect to what was passed, and those
that listen to the Voice of Providence in such
Things, should at least lay them up in their
Hearts.
Eminent Deliverances in sudden Dangers are of
the most significant kind of Providence, and
which accordingly have a loud Voice in them, calling upon us to be thankful, to that blested
Hand,' that has been pleased to spare and protect
us. The Voiqe of such signal Deliverances, is
frequently a just Call upon us to repentance and looks directly that Way; often 'tis a Caution
against falling into the like Dangers we were ex-
posed to, from which nothing but so much Good-
ness could deliver us again. In how many Occa-
sions of Life, if God's Providence had no greater
share in our Safety than our own prudence, "' * iiibuld
should we plunge and precipitate our selves ihtd
all manner of Misery and Distress ? and how of-
ten for want of listening to those Providences do
we miscarry?
* Innumerable instances present themselves to us
every Day, in which the Providence of God speaks
to us, in things relating to ourselves; in Delive-
rances to excite our Thankfulness, in Views of
Dangers to awaken our Caution, and to make us
walk wisely and circumspectly in every Step we
take; those that are awake to these things, and
have their Ears open to the Voice of them, many
Times reap the Benefit of their instruction by
being protected, while those who neglect them,
are of the Number of the Simple, who pass on
and are punished.
To be utterly careless of ourselves in such Cases*
and talk of trusting Providence, is a lethargy of
the worst Nature; for as we are to trust Provi-
dence, with our Estates, but to use at the same
Time, all Diligence in our Callings; so we1
are to trust Providence with our Safety, but
with our Eyes open to all its neceflary Cautions,
Warnings, and Instructions ; many of which Provi-
dence is pleased to give us in the Course of Life, for
the Direction of our conduct, and which we should
ill place to the account of Providence, without ac-
knowledging that they ought to be regarded, and
a due reverence paid to them upon all Occasions.
I take a general neglect of these Things, to
be a kind of practical Atheism, or at least a living
in a kind of Contempt of Heaven, regardless of
all that Share, which his invisible Hand has in the
Things thatbefcal us.
Such a Man receives good at the Hand of his
Maker, but unconcerned at the very Nature or
Original of it, looks not at all to the Benefactor:
Again,
Again, he receives Evil, but has no sense of it, as
a judicial dispensing of Punishment from Heaven >
but insensible of one or other, he.is neither thank-
ful for one, nor humble undei'the other, but stupid
in both, as: if he was out of God's Care, and God
himself out of his Thoughts; this is just the re-
verse of the Temper I am recommending, and let
the picture recommend it self to any according to
its Merit* •'
When Prince Vandemont commanded the confe-
derate army in Flanders, the fame Campaign that
King William was beleiging Namure, some Troops
were ordered to march into the flat Country to-
wards Newport, in Order to make a Diversion,
and draw down the Count de Montal, who com-
manded a flying Body about Menin, and to keep
him from joining the Duke de Vilkroy, who com-
manded the1 main Body of the French Army.
The soldiers were ordered upon Pain of Death
not to stir from their Camp, or to plunder any of
the Country People; the Reason was evident,
because Provisions being somewhat scarce, if the
Boors were not protected they would have fled
from their Houses, and the Army would have
been put to great Straits, being just entred into the
Enemies Country. ».
It happened that Eve Englijlo Soldiers straggling
beyotld their. Bounds were fallen upon,, near a
Farm-Houses by some of the Country People (for
indeed the Boors were oftentirnes too unmerciful
to-the Soldiers) as if they had plunder'd Nthem,
when indeed they had not: The Soldiers de-
fended themfeSve^; got the better, and killed two
of the Boors; and being, as they thought, justly
provok'd by being first attacked, they broke into
the House, and then used them roughly enough
indeed. ., , . . ,; 1
Tlfey
They found in the House a great" Quantity of
Apples, the People being fled had left them in
possession, and they made no Haste to go away, but fell to work with the Apples; and heating the
Oven put a great quantity of Apples into the
Oven to roast. In the mean Time the Boors,
who knew their Number to be but five, and had
got more Help on their Side, came down upon
them again, attacked the House, forced their Way
in, mastered the Englishmen, killed two, and took
a third, and barbarously put him into the Oven,
which he had heated, where he was smotherM to
Death,* it seems it was not hot enough to burn
him.
The other two escaped, but in coming back to
the camp, they were immediately apprehended
by the Provosts, and brought to a Court Martial,
where they were sentenced not for Plundering, for
that did not appear, but for being out of the
Bounds appointed by the general Order, as a bove.
When the Sentence came to be executed, the
, General was prevailed upon to spare one of them,
and to order them to cast Lots for their Lives.
This, as it is known is usually done by throwing
Dice upon a Drumhead; and he that throws
highest or lowest, as is appointed before is to
dies at this time he that threw lowest was to
live.
When the Fellows were brought out to throw,
the, first threw two Sixes, and fell immediately
to wringing his Hands, crying he was a dead
Man* but was as much surpriz'd with Joy, when
his Comrade throwing, there came up two Sixes
also»
- #
The
The officer appointed to see Execution was £
little doubtful what to do, but his Orders being
positive3 he commanded them to throw again;
they did so, and each of them threw two fives,* the Soldiers that stood round shouted, and said
neither of them was to die: The officer being a
re thinking Man, said it was grange, and
looked like something from Heaven, and he would
not proceed without acquainting the Council of
War, which was then fitting; they considered a
while, and at last'ordered them to take other Died'
and to throw again, which was done, and both
the Soldiers threw two Fours.
The Officer goes back to the Council of War,-
who were surpriz'd very much, and looking on it
as the Voice of Heaven, respited the Execution
till the General was acquainted with it.
The General fends for the Men and examines
them strictly, who'telling him the whole Story, he
pardoned them with this Expression to those about
him, I love, say$ he, in such extraordinary Cases to
listen to the voiceof Providence.
While we are in this un-inform'd State, where
we know so little of the invisible World, it would
be greatly our Advantage, if we knew rightly,
and without the Bondage of Enthusiasm and Su-
perstition, how to make use of the Hints given,
us from above, for our Direction in' Matters of
the greatest importance .
It has pleased God very much to straighten the
special and particular Directions, \frhich he gives to Men immediately from himself; but I dare not
say, they are quite ceased; we read of many Ex-
amples in Scripture, how God spake to Men by
Voice immediately from Heaven, by Appearance
of Angels, or by Dreams and Visions of the
Night, and by all these not in Public and-more
extraordinary Cafes only* but in private, persdna/,
iari4 family concerns. Thus God is said to have appeared to Abraham,to Loty and to Jacob; Angels also have appeared
in many other Cafes, and to many several Persons,
as to Manoah, and his Wife, to Zachariah,to the
. Virgin Mary,and to the Apostles; others have,
been warned in a Dream, as King Abirnelech, the
false Prophet Balaam, Pontius Pilate'sWife, Herod,
Joseph, the Apostles also> and many others;
We cannot fay, but these and all the miracu-
lous Voices, the prophetic Messages prefaG'd
boldly by the Ancients, with thus saiththe Lord
. are ceas'd* and as we have a more sure PJ/ord of
prophecyhanded to us by . the million of Gospel
, Ministers; to which the Scripture fays, We
do well that we take heed J,and to whom our
blessed Lord has said, Lo, I amwith you to the End
us the worldi I say* as we have this Gospel backed
With the Spirit and Presence of God, we are no
Losers, if we observe the Rule laid down, viz,,
that we be obedient to the heavenly vision,for
such it is* as well as that of the Apostle Peter's
Dream of the Sheet let down from Heaven*
I mention this to pay a due Reverence to the
sufficiency of Gospel Revelation, and to the
guiding of the Spirit of God, who in spiritual
Things is given td lead us into all Truth, nor
would I have any Thing, which I am going to
fay, tend to lessen these great Efficients of our
eternal Salvation*
But I am chiefly upon our conduct in the infe-
, rior Life, as I may call it; and in this, I think,
the Voice of God, even his immediate Voicefrom
Heaven, is not entirely ceased from us, though ic
may have changed the Mediums of Communica^
tion.

was good. Pbvidence that seemed to animadvert upon his conduct, so ordered it _tbat something
or other mischievous always happened to him
there, or as he went thither several Times he
was robbed on the Highway going thither, once
of twice taken very'iil; 'at other Times his Affairs
in the World went As, while he diverted himself
there; several of his Friends cautioned him of it
and told him, he ought to consider that some su-
perior Hand seemed to hint to him, that he
should come there no more ; he slighted the Hint/
or at least neglected it after some Time, and went
to the same Place again: But was so terrified
with a most dreadful tempest of Thunder and
Lightning, which fell as it were more particular-
ly upon that P{art of the Country than upon
others ; that he took it as a Warning from Heaven*
and resolv'd not to go there again, and some
time after a Fire destroyed that House, very few
escaping that were in it.

It would be an ill account we should give of
the Government of divine. Providence in the
World, if we fhould^argue, that its Events are so
unavoidable, and every Circumstance so determin-
ed, that nothing can be altered; and that therefore
these Warnings of Providence are inconsistent with
the Nature of it. * This besides that I think it
would take from the Sovereignty of Providence,
and deny even God himself the Privilege of "being
a free agent, it would also so contradict the Ex-
perience of every Man living, in the Varieties of
- his respective Life, that he should be unable to'
give any account for what End many Things,
which Providence directs in the Worid, are di-
rected, an(d why so many Things happen which
do happen ,• why are Evils attending us so evi-
dently foretold, boa those Fore-tellings they are
avoided, if it was not determined before that they
should be avoided, and should not befal us?
People that tye up all to Events and Causes,
strip the Providence of God which guides the
World of all its'Superin tendency, and leave it
no room to act as a wife Disposer tof Things.
It seems to me that the immutable Wisdom and
Power of the Creator, and the Notion of it in
the Minds of Men, is^as dutifully preserved, and is
as legible to our Understanding, though there be
a Hand left at Liberty to direct the Course of na-
tural Causes and Events; 'Tis sufficient to the
Honour of an immutable deity, that for thfc
common Incidents of Life, they be left to the
Disposition of a daily Agitator,! namely, divine
Providence, to, order and direct them as it shall fee
good, within the natural Limits p( Cause ^nd

the Government of Causes and Effects in its hand, so it gives a very convincing Evidence of that

us, toe ought to make a suitable Use of it another

the various Conduct of Providence in the several
P'aflages of Man's Life, so there are infinite Cir-

nately resolv'd against paying the Homage of their deliverances to their Maker, or paying the; Re-
verence due to his Terrors, in any thing that be-
falls them ill, where it ought to be paid, that
"they will give all that Honour to another. If it
was well, they tell you, they know not how, but
so it happens, or'it was so by good Chance,
and thelikq. This is a Sort'of language I can-
not understand: It seems to be a felonious
Thought in its very Design, robbing Heaven of
the Honour due to it, and lifting our selves in
the Regiment of the ungrateful. But this is not all,' for one Crime leads on to a-
th£r-> if this Part is Felony or Robbery, the
next is Treason, for resolving first to deny the
Homage of good or evil Events to God from
whose hands they come, they go on and pay
it to the Devil, the Enemy of his praise, and
Rival of his Power.
v' Two of there Wretches traveled a little Journey
with me Tome years ago; and in their Return,
some Time after I was gone from them, they met
with a very different adventure, and telling me
the Story, they expressed themselves thus, theywere riding from Huntirigton towards London, and
in some Lanes betwixt Huntington and Caxton, one
bapperid by a Slip of hisHorse s Foot, which lamedhim
a little,to stay about balsa Mile behind the other, was
set upon by some Highway-men, who robbedhim, and
abusedhim very much; the other went on to Caxton,
not taking careof his Companion, thinking he hadstay d
on' fo?ne particular occasion,and, escaped the 'Thieves^ „
they making off cross the Country towards Cambridge.
'Well; say$ I to the first, How came you to
escape? / don't know not I, says he, I happen d not
to look behind me, when his Horse stumbl'd, and
I went forwards and by good Luck, adds he again,

We have a plain Guide for this in Scripture*
Language, in the Law of Man-slaughter,, or
D^ath, as we call it foolishly enough, by' Misadven-
ture it is in the %i Exod. 13. in the Cafe of casual
/killing a Man, it is expressed thus, If a Man lye
not in Watty but God deliver him into his Hand. This
was not to be accounted Murther, but the Slayet
was to fly to the City of Refuge.
* Here it is .evident, that God takes all thefe
Misadventures, into his own Hand; and a Man
killed by Accident, is. a Man whom God has de-
livered up, for what End in his Providence is known
opjy to h^se]f, to be kill'd in that Manner, per-
haps, vindictively, perhaps not.

ar&ouf fftp.pte w4 empty Ways of talking of things
that are oxd^rsd by the immediate Hand or Pite^
ction of God's Providence.
The Words last quoted from the Scripture of
God's delivering a Man into another Mans Hand to
be killed unwillinglyy are fully explained in another
Place, Dent, xix, 5*
As when a Man goeth into the Wood with his Neigh-
bour, to hew Wood, and his Hand fetches a Stroke
with the Ax to cut down the Trze, and the Head fltp-
pethfrom the Helve,.and lighteth upon his Neighbours
that he die-, he shall flee unto one of those Cities, and
live.
The wicked thoughtless Creature, I have.jqst
mentioned, whose Horse fell lame, and stops hi>
Travelling, till he might come just in the Way> of
those Thieves, who it seems were crossing the
Country, perhaps upon some other Exploit, ought_
to
$p feave reflected, that Providence, to chastise
him, and bring him to a Sense of his Dependance
upon, and being subjected to his Power, had di-
rected him to be separated from his Companion,
that he might fall into the Hands that robb'd and
abusM himand the other had no less Obliga-
tion to give Thanks for his Deliverance: But how
contrary they acted in both Cafes, you haye
heard.
We have had abundance of Collections, in my
Remembrance, of remarkable Providences, as they
are Galtfd j and many People are forward to call
them so': But this does hot come up to the Cafe
in Hand.
Tho* contemning Providence, and giving the
Homage due to tt, as above, to the Devi], or ,tQ
Chance, Fate, and I know not what Embrio s of
x the Fancy are impious; yet every one that avoids
tliis Evil,' doe$ not come up to the particular Point
t am speaking of r for there is a manifest Diffe*-
~ tehee between acknowledging the Being and Ope- 
rations of Providence, and lifining to-ks Voice, as
.many People acknowledge a God, that obey none
of his'Commands, and concern themselves in no-
thing of theic Duty to him.
To listen to the Voice of Providence, is to take
strict Notice of ail the remarkable Steps of Provi-
dence, which relate to ns'in particular, to observe,
if there is nothing in them instructing to (our Con-
duct-, no Warning to us for avoiding som$ Dan-
ger > no Direction for the; taking some particular
Steps for our Safety or Advantage; no Hint to re-
mind us of such and such thingsr omitted; no Con-
viction of something committed; no'vindictive
Step, by Way of Retaliation,' 'marking out the
Crime in the Punishment; You may easily ob-
serve the Differences between the Directions aud
War.
Warnings q( [Providence, when duly listened to,
and the Notices of Spirits from an invisible
World, viz,, that these are dark Hints of Evil,witK
1 very little Direction to avoid it: Bat those' Noti-
ces, which are to be taken from the Proceedings
of Prpvidence, tho' the Voice be a Kind of silent
or soft whisper ; yet 'tss generally attended with
an Offer of the Means for escaping the Evil, nay,
very often leads by the Hand.to the very proper
Steps to be taken; and even obliges us, by a strong conviction of the Reason of it, to take those
steps. It is in vain for me to run into a Collection of
Stories; for Example, where the Variety is infinite,
and things vary as every particular Man s Circum-
stances vary i but as every Event in the World is
manag'd by the Superintendencyof Providence; for every Providence has in it some thing instructing,,
formed thing; that' s upon us to look up, or look
Out, or loofcr in.
Every one of these Heads are big with particu-
lar Explanations; but my business is not Preach-
ing; I am^ making Observations and Reflections,
let those matceEnlargements who read it: In a Word,
there is scarce *any particular Providence attends
¥ our Lives, but we*ihall find, if we give due
'Weight to it, that it calls upon us, either, i. To lookup, and acknowledge the goodness of God in sparing us, the Bounty of God in
providing for us, the Power of God in deli-
vering and protecting us, not forgetting to
look up, and acknowledge, and be humble
under the Justice of God, in being angry
with, and afflicting us.

that is to say, that the Christian Religion,
or the profession of the doctrine of the Messiah,
fliall be made national over the whole Globe, ac-
"cording to those words, Nlatth. xxiv. 14, MarkxiiL
13. Luke xxiv. 17. But this may be a little too
apocalyptical, or visionary for the Times; and'tis
no Business of mine, to enter upon the Interpre-
tation of Scripture Difficulties, whatever I may
understand, or believe my self about them; but
rather to make my Observations, as I have 'be-
gun, upon things which now are, and which we
have seen and know, let what is to come, be as he
pleases, who has ordered things pasti and knows
what is to follow.
The present Case is, to speak of the mathema-
tical Proportion that there is now to be observed
upon the Plain of the Globe, and observe how
small a tart of the World it is, where the Chri-
stian religion has really prevails and is natio-
nally f^rofess'd^ I speak of the Christian Religion,
where it is, as I call it, National, that is, in its
utmost Latitude; and I do so, that I may give
the utmost Advantage, even against my self, in
what lam going^o fay 5 and therefore, when I
come to make deductions for the Mixtures of bar-
barous Nations, I shall do it fairly also.
I have nothing to do with the Distinctions of
Christians: I hope none will object against calling
the Roman Church, a Christian Church, in this
respect, and the Professors of the Popish Church,
Christians j neither do I scruple to call the Greek
Church Christian, xho in some Places so^blended
with Superstition and barbarous Customs as in
Georgia, Armenia, and the Borders of Persia and
Tartars; likewise in many Parts of the Czarof Muscovy's Dominions, that (as before) the name of Christ is little more than just spoken of, and
literally known, without any material Knowledge
of his Person, Nature, and Dignity; or of the
Homage due to him as the Redeemer of the
World.
The Nations of the World them where Christ
is acknowledged, and the Christian Religion is
profess'd nationally* be it Romish Church or Greek
Church, or even the Protestant Chutcji, in-
cluding all the several Subdivisions and Denomi-
nations of Protestants, take them allay Christians,
I fay, these Nations are as follow.
1. In Europe; Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Great
Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Muscovy, Poland, Hun-
gary, Tranfilvania, Moldavia, and Walachia.
2. In Asia, Georgia, and Armenia.
3. In Africa: No Place at all, the few factories of
European Merchants, only excepted.
4. In America: The Colonies of Europeans only, as
follow;
1. The Spaniards, in Mexico and Peru^ the Coasts
of Chili, of Cartagena, and St. Martha,and a
small Colony at the Buenos Ayres on the Rio
de la Plata.
2. The Portuguese, in the Brafils.
3. The British, on the Coast of America^ front
the Gulph of Florida to Cape Britoon on the Mouth of the Gulph of St. Lawrence, or the
( great River of Canada, also a little in New-
foundland, ^nd tiudfons Bay,
R 4. The'
4, The Eemh in the River of Canada, and the
great River of Mississippi.
5. The English, French, and Dutch, on the Islands
call'd the Carnbbees, &c«
The chief Seat of the Christian Religion is at
present in Europe: But if we measure the Quarter
of the World, we call Europe upon the Plan of the
Globe,and cast up the northern,frozen, and indeed
unhabitable Part of it, such Laponia, Petz,ora, Can-
dor a, Obdora, and the Samoiedes, with Part of Siberia,
they are all Pagans, with the eastern unpeopled
Deiarts, bordering upon Asia, on the Way to Chi- na, and the vast Extent of Land on that Side,
which tho' nominally under the Dominion of
Muscovy, is yet all Pagan, even nationally so, un-
under no real government, but of their own Pa-
gan Customs.
If we go from thence to the South, and take out
of it the Ewopean 'Tartars, viz,, of Circajsia,
the Crimeey and Budziack, if you go on, and
draw a Line from the Cnm Tartary to the
Danube,and from thence to the Adriatuk Gulph,
and cut off all the Grand Seignior s European Do-
minions; I fay, take this Extent of Land out of
Europe, and the Remainder does not measure full
two Thirds of Land in Europe, under the Christi-
an Government, much of which is also Desart,
and uninhabited, or at least, by such as cannot be
called Christians, and do not concern themselves
about it, as particularly, the Svoedtjh and Norwe-
gean Lapland, the more eastern and southern Mus-
covy y beyond the Wolga, even to Kdrakathay, act to
the Borders of Asia on the Side oi!ndia\ I fay,
taking in this Part, not above one half of Europe
is really inhabited by Christians.
TfheOt^rof Muscovy, of the religion, of whose
subjects I s said enough, is Lord of a vast ex-
tended Country; and those who have measurM
it critically, say, his Dominions are larger than all
the rest of Europe; that is to fay, that he possesses
a full Half as much a^ Europe; and in those Domi-
nions, he is Master of Abundance of Nations, that
'are Pagan or Mahometan, as in particular Circas-
sian being conquered by him, the Circaffian "Tartars^
who are all Mahometans, or the most of them, are
his subjects. However, since a Christian Monareh governs
them, we must upon the Plan I laid down, call
this a Christian Country; and that alone obliges
me to give two Thirds of Europe to the Chri-
stians.
But this will bring another account upon my
- Hands co ballance it, viz* That excepting this
two Thirds, there will not come one Christian to
be accounted for in any of the other three Parts of
the World, except Georgia and Armenia; as for Africa, there is nothing to be mentioned on that
Side: All the Christians that are on the Conti-
nent of Africk,, consisting only of a few Merchants
residing at the Coast Towns in the Mediterranean,
as at Alexandria,Grand Cairo, Tunis, Tripoli, Al-
gier, &c. The factories of the English and Dutch,
pn the Coast of'Guinea, the Gold Coast, the Coast
of Angola^ and at the Cape ofGood Hope', all which
put together,' as I have calculated them, and as
they are calculated by a better Judgment than mine,
will not amount to 5000 People, excepting Chri-
stian Slaves in Sallee,Algiers,Tunis, Tripoli, &co
which are not so many more,
America is thronged with Christians, God wot," such as they are 5 forI must confesej the Euro-
pean inhabitants of some of the- Colonies there^
R a ai
a's well French and English, as Spanish and
very ill merit that Name.
- Some Part of America is entirely under the Do-
minion and Government of the European nations,* and having indeed destroyed the Natives, and
made desolate the Country, they may be said to
-be Christian Countries in the sense, as above.
But what Numbers do these amount to, com- par d to the Inhabitants of so great a Part of the
World, as that of America, which at least is three
Times as big as Europe, and in which are still
vast extended Countries, infinite Numbers of Peo-
ple of Nations unknown, and even unheard of;
which neither the English, French, Spanish, or Por-
tuguese have ever seen Witness the Populous Ci-
ties and innumerable Nations, which Sir Walter
Raleigh met with in his Voyage up the great
'River Oroonoque; in one of which they talk of two
Millions of People, Witness the Nations infinite-
ly populous, spread on both Sides the River de
AmbXtcneiy and all the Country between these two
prodigious Rivers, being a Country above 400
Miles in -Breadth, and 1600 Miles in Length,
besides its extent South even to the Rio Para-
guay, and S. E. to the Brafih, a rich, fruitful, and
populous Country;' and in which, by the Ac-
counts given, there must be more people inhabit-
ing at this Time, than in all theÆhristan Part of
Europe put together, being the Chief, if not the on-
ly Part of America, into which the Spaniards ne-
ver came3 and whether the frighted People fled
from them, being so fortify*d with Rivers and un-
'paflable Bays and rapid Currents, and so inac-
cessible by the Number of Inhabitants, the Heat
of the Climate, and the Mountains, waterfalls, and touch other Obstructions, that the Spaniards
'dutstr never attempt to penetrate the Way.1
What
Cm*3
What are the Numbers of Christians in Amertia, put them altogether to the Inhabitants of
these Parts of America, besides the Northern
Parts of America not enquired into.
But we are not calculating of People yet, but
the Extent of Land, that the Christians possess,
the British Colonies in the North, areby far the
most populous even more than the Spaniards them, selves, though the latter extend themselves over
more Land.
The British Colonies in the North of America
are supposed to contain Three Hundred Thousand
Souls, including Nova Scotia, New England, New
York,New Jersey, East and West Penfilvania, Ma-
ryland, Virginia, and Carolina, and these lye ex-»
tended upon the Coast from the Latitude of 3 2
Degrees, to 47, or thereabouts, being about 75:0
Miles in Length; but then much of this is very
thinly peopled, and the Breadth they lye West
into the Country is little or nothing, 50 Miles
or 60 Miles is in many Places the most ; and ex-
cept some Plantations in Virginia in Rapqhanvcky
and JamesRiver in Virginia, occasioned by the
great In-let of the baythere, and of the Rivers
that fall into it. We can fee nothing an hundred
Miles within that Land but waste and Woods,
whose Inhabitants seem to be fled farther up in-
to the Country from the Face of their Enemies
the Christians,
So that all this planting though so considerable,
amounts to no more compared to the Country it-
self, than a long narrow Slip of Land upon the
Sea-Coast, there being very few Enghfo Inhabir
tants planted any where above twenty Miles
from the Sea, or from some navigable River, and
even that Sea-Coast itself very thinly inhabited,
and particularly from New-England to New York,R 3 from
from New-England North to Annapolis from Vis
ginia to Carolina; fo that all this great Colony or
Collection of Colonies, nay, tho' we include the
French at Canada, are but a Point, a Handful, com-
par'd to the vast Extent pf Land lying West and
North-Westxfrom them, even-to the South-Sea,
#n Extent of Continent full of innumerable Na*
tions of people unknown, undiscovered, never
searched into or indeed heard of, but from one
another, much greater in its Extent than $11
Europe.
If we take the North Part of America exclusive
of all the Country, which the Spaniards poffefs,
and \$rhich they call the Empire of Mexico '> and ex-
clusive too of what the English and French possess
on the Coast, and ia the two Rivers of Canada
&\\&Mi[fifippi as ahove,which indeed are butTrifles;
the rest of that Country which as far as it has been
travelled into, is found exceeding populous, is a great
deal larger than all Europe, though we have not
reckoned the most northern, Frozen and almost
.unhabitable Part of it,.where 00 £nd can be found,
and where it is no doubt, but there is a conti-
guous Continent with the Northern Part of Afia%
or so near joynlng, as to be only parted by a nar-
row Gulph and Streight of Sea, easily passed over
both by Man or Beast, or el fe it would be hard
,to give an Account how Man or Beast came into
that Part of the World; I fay, this vast Conti-
nent full of People, and no doubt, inhabited by
many Millions of Souls, is all wrapt up in Idola-
try and paganism, given up to ignorance and
Blindness, worshipping the Sun, the Moon, the
Fire, the Hills their Fathers, and in a Word the
Devil. As to the Thing we call Religion, or the knowledge of the true God, much, less the Doctrine qf
the
the Messiah, and the Name of Christ, they nqt
only have not, but never had the least Intimation of
it, on Earth, or Revelation of it from Hea\/jn,
xill«the Spaniards came among them: Nay,
and now Christians are come among them,
'tis hard to fay, whether the Paganism is
much abated, except by the infinite Ravages the
Spaniards made where they came, who rooted
out the Idolatry by destroying the Idolaters, not
by converting them; having cruelly cut off, as
their own Writers affirm, above seventy Millions
of People, and left the Country naked of its In-
habitants for many hundred Miles together.
< But what need we come to Calculations for the
present Time with Respect to America, let us but
be at the Trouble to look back a little more than
a hundred years, which is as nothing at all in the
Argument; how had the whole Continent of A-
merica extended almost from Pole to Pole, with
all the Wands round it,and peopled with such innu-
merable Multitudes of People, been as it were en-
tirely abandoned to the Devil's Government, even
from the beginning of Time, or at least from the
second Peopling the World by Noah to the i<5th
Century, when Ferdinando Cortex,General for the
famous Charles the 5th, first landed in the Gulph
of Mexico?We have heard much of the Cruelty of the Spa-
niards in destroying such Multitudes of the Inha-
bitants there, and of cutting off whole Nations
by Fire and Sword: But as I am for giving up
all the Actions of Men to the Government of Pro-
vidence, it seeips to me, that Heaven had
determined such an Act of Vengeance (should be executed, and of which the Spaniards
were Instruments, to destroy those People, who
were come up (by the influence" of the Devil, no
R 4 Doubts
• [ hH
doubt) to such a dreadful height, in that abhorr*4
Custom of human Sacrifices,1 that the innocent
Blood cried for it, and it seemed to be a Time to'put a Stop to that Crime, lest the very Race of People
Should at last be extinct by their own Butcheries.
The magnitude of this may be guessed at, by
the Temple consecrated to the great Idol of
Vistlipufth in the City of Mexico, where at the
Command of Montcmma 'the Pagan Monarch,
twenty thousand Men were sacrificed in a Year,
and the Wall hung a Foot thick with clotted
Blood, dashed in Ceremony against the side of
that Place on those Occasions.'
This Abomination God in his Providence, put
an End to, by destroying those Nations from the
Face of the Earth, bringing a Race bf bearded
Strangers upon them, cutting in Pieces Man, Wo-
man and Child, destroying their Idols, and even the
Idolatry it self by the Spaniards; who, however
wicked in themselves, yet were in this to be
esteemed Instruments in the Hand of Heaven, to
execute the divine justice, ' on Nations, whose
Crimes were come up to a full Height, and that
called for Vengeance.
I make no doubt (to carry on this Digression a
littTp farther) that when God cast"out the Hea-
then, so the Scripture calls it, from before the
Israelites,and the Iniquity of the People of the
Land was 'full, Joshua, Mosesr and the Israelites
were tax'd with as much Cruelty and inhumanity, in destroying the Cities, killing Man5 Woman,
and Child; nay, even destroying the very Cattle, 'and Trees, and Fruits of the Earth, as ever the
Spaniards were charged with ..in the Conquest of
Mexico/'
J. This is apparent by the Terror that was spread
upon the minds ot the People round about them,
t, • whereof
thereof thousands fled to other Parts of the
World. That History tells us, that the first:
Builders of the City of Carthage, long before the
Roman Times, or before the Fable of Queen Dido,
* were some Phenicians, that is to fay, Canaanites,
who flying for their Lives, got §hips and went
away to sea, planting themselves on the Coast of Africa,as the first Place of Safety they arrived at,
and to prove this a Pillar of Stone, was found not
far, from Tripoli, on which was cut in Phenician
characters, these Words, We are of those who fledfrom ,theFace of Joshua the Robber,
The Cruelties of the Israelites, in destroying
the Nations of the Land of Canaan, was com-
manded from Heaven; and therein Joshua was
justify'd in what was done. The Cruelties of the
Spaniards, however abhorr'd by us, was doubtless
an Appointment of God, for the Destruction of the
wickedest 'and most abominable People upon
Earth.
But ..this is all a Digression; I come to my Cal-
culation: It is true, that the Spaniards, whom I
allow to be Christians, have possessed the Empires
of Mexico and Peru: But after all the Havocs
they made, and the Millions of Souls they dis-
\ miss'd out of Life there, yet the Natives are in-
finitely the Majority of the Inhabitants and tho' many of them are christianize, they are little more
than subjected, and take all the Spaniards, Christi-
ans, and all the Portuguese in the Brasils, all the
Englishand French in the North, and in a Word, all
the Christians in America, and put them together,
they will not ballance one Part of the Pagans or
Mahometans in Europe :"For Example, Take the
Crim Tartars of Europe,who inhabit the Bank of
the Euxine Sea, they are more in Number than all
the Christians in America; so that setting one Na-
tion
tion against the other, and you may reckon that
there is not one Christian, or as if there were not
one Christian in those three Parts of the World*>Asia,
Africa, and America, except the Greeks of Asia.
This is a just but a very fad Account of the
small Extent of Christian Knowledge in the
World; and were it considers as it ought, would
put the most powerful princes of Europe upon
thinking ot some Methods, at least to open a Way
for the spreading Christian Knowledge. I am
not much of the Opinion indeed, that Religion
should be planted by the Sword: But as the Chri-
stian Princes of Europe, however few in number, are yet so superior to all the rest of the World in
martial Experience and the Art of War, nothing
Is mere certain than that, if they could unite their
interest, they are able to beat Paganism out of the
World. Nothing is more certain than this, that
would the Christian Princes unite their Powers, and
act in Concert, they might destroy the Turkish Em-
pire, and the Persian Kingdom, and beat the very
Name of Mahomet out or the World.
It is no Boast to fay, That were there no inte-
stine Broils among us, the Christian Soldiery is
so evidently superior to the Turks at this Time,
,that had they all joined after the late Battel at
Belgrade, to have sent 80000 Veteran Soldiers to
have join'd Prince Eugene, and supply'd him with
Money and Provisions by the ports of the Adriatic
Gulph, and the Archipelago,that Prince would in
two or three Campaigns, have driven theMa-
hometans out of Europe, taken Constantinople, and
have overtutn'd the TurkishEmpire.
After such a Conquest, whether might not the
Christian religion have spread? The King of Spain
with the same Ease would reduce the Moors
oiBarbary, and dispossess thole Sons of Hell the
Alge-
Algerines, Paleslunizeens, and all the Maho-
metan Pyrates of that Coast, and plant again
the antient Churches of Africa,the Sees of TertuB~
an, St. Cyprian&c.
Nay, even the Czar of Muscovy, an enterprizing
and glorious Prince, well assisted and supported by
his Neighbours, the Northern Powers, who to-
gether are Masters of the best soldiery in the
World, would not find it impossible to march an
Army of 36000 Foot and itfooo_ Horse, in Spite
of waste and unhospitable Desarts, even to attack
the Chinese Empire; who, notwithstanding their
infinite Numbers, pretended Policy and great
Skill in War, would sink in the Operation: And
such an army^ of disciplined European Soldiers, would beat all the Forces of that vast Empire/with
the fame (or greater) Ease, as Alexander with
30000 Macedonians destroys the Army of Darius,
which consisted of 680000 Men.
And let no Man 'ridicule this project, on Ac-
count of the March which I know they will call
3000 Miles and more: While there is no Obstru-
ction, but the Length of the Way, it is not so
difficult as some may imagine 'tis far from im-
possible, to furnish sufficient Provisions for the
March, which is indeed the only Difficulty that
carries any Terror in it. *
Such a Prince as the Czar of Muscovy cannot
want the Assistance of innumerable Hands, for the
Amassing or Carriage for conveying to proper Ma-
gafcinej^&fficient Stores of Provisions, for the
maintOTiiig a select chosen Body of Men to march
over the Dfesarts; for in the grand March, no. iiselefe Mouths should be found to feed.
Why then should not the Christian Princes think
it a Deed of Compassion to the Souls of Men, as
11 as an humble Agency to the Work of Provi-
dence*
4ence, and to the Fulfilling the Promises of their
Saviour, by a moderate, and as far as in them lyes,
a bloodless Conquest, to reduce the whole World
to the Government of Christian Power, and so
plant the Name and Knowledge of Christ Jesus
among the Heathens and Mahometans? I am not
supposing, that they can plant real Religion in
this manner ; the Business of Power, is to open
the Way to the Gospel of Peace, the Servants of
the King of the Earth are to fight, that the Ser-
vants of the King of Heaven may preach.
Let' s: an open Door be made for the preach-
ing of the Word of God, and the Ministers; of
.Christ be admitted, if they do not spread Christi-
an Knowledge over the Face of the Earth, the
Fault will be their's. Let but the military Power
(reduce the Pagan world, and banish the Devil and
Mahomet from the Face of the Earth, the Know-
ledge of God be diligently spread, the Word of God duly preached, and the People meekly and faith-
fully instructed in the Christian Religion; the
world would soon receive the Truth, and the
Knowledge of divine things would be the study and Delight of Mankind.
I know, some nice and difficult people would
object: here, how are the present Body of Christi-
ans, Bayou call ihein> qualified to convert the Pa-
gan and Mahometan world, when they are not
able to settle the main point, viz,. What the Chri-
stian Religion is, Or, what they would convert
them to? That Christianity is subdivide^into so
many Parts, and particular s People so
divided in their Opinion; and that which isstill
worse, there is so little Charity among the several
Sorts, that some of them would rather sicie with
Mahomet against their Neighbours3than assist to pro-
pagate that particular doctrine in religion which
they condemn. Thus the Members o£the Prate*
stant Faith would make it a Point of Principle,
not to supporr or propagate the Interest of Popery
in such a Conquest as this: And again, the Ca-
tholicks would as much make it a Duty on
them to root out heresy, so they call the Prote-
stant DoBririe? as they would to root out Paganism
and the Worship of Devils.
I would not answer for some Protestants, that
they would not be of the fame Mind as to particu-
lar Divisions among Protestants: The Difference
among some opinions is such, and their Want
of Charity one to another, sets them at such Va-
riance, that if they do not censure one another for
Devil-Worshippers, yet we know they frequently
call some of the opposite Principles, Doctrines of
Devils; and persecute one another with as much
Fury, as ever the Heathen persecuted the Primi-
tive Churches.
Witness the Violences which have reign'd be-
tween the Episcopal and Presbyterian Parties, in the
North of Ireland, and in Scotlandy which has so
often broken out into a flame of War, and that
Flame been always quenched with blood. Witness the frequent Persecutions, Wars, Mas-
sacres, and other cruel and unnatural Doings, which have been in these Parts of the World among
Christians, the effect of a mistaken Zeal for the
Christian Religion which as it was not planted
by Blood and Violence, so much less can Christi-
ans justify the Endeavours to erect this or that
Opinion in it, by the Ruine and Blood of then?
Brethren.
But this is far from being a reason, why we
should not think it our duty to subdue the barba-
rous and idolatrous Nations of the World; in Or-
der to suppress the Worshipping the Devil, who
is the Enemy not only of God, and of all true Re-
ligion in the World, but who is the great Destroy-
er and Enemy of Mankind, and of his future or
present Felicity; and whose Business is always to
the utmost of his Power to involve and retain them
either in Ignorance, or in Error.
I distinguish between forcing Religion upon
People, or forcing them to entertain this or that
; Opinion of Religion; 1 fay, I distinguish between
that, and opening the Door for Religion to come
among them: The former is a Violence indeed, inconsistent with the Nature of Religion it self,
whose Energy prevails and forces its Way into the
Minds of Men, by another Sort of Power; Where-
as the latter is removing a Force unjustly put al-
ready upon the Minds of Men by the Artifice of
the Devil, to keep the Christian Religion out of
the World > so that indeed I propose a War not
with Men, but with the Devil; a War to depose
'Sathan's infernal Tyranny in the World, and set
open the Doors to Religion, that it may enter if
Men will receive it; if they will not receive it, be that to themselves.
In a fVwdy to unchain the Wills of Men, set
their Inclinations free, that their Reason may be
at Liberty to influence their Understandings, and
that they may have the Faith of Christ preached to them; whether they will hear or forbear, I fan as above, is no Part of the Question, let the Chri-
stian Doctrine and its spiritual Enemies alone to struggle about that: I am for dealing with the
Temporalities of the Devil, and deposing thathu*
man Power which is armed in the Behalf of obsti*
natc ignorance, atxlrresolute to keep out the Light
of Religion from the Mind.
I think
1 think this is a lawful and just War, and in the
End, kind both to them and their Posterity: Let me
bring the Cafe home to ourselves.
Suppose neither Julius Cesar or any of the Ro-
man Generals or emperors, had cast their Eyes
towards Britain for some Ages, or till the Christian
Religion had spread over the whole Roman Em-
pire, 'Tis true, the Britains might at last have received the Christian Faith in common with therest of the Northern World; but they had yet layn
above 300 Years longer in Ignorance and Paganism,
than they did; and some hundred thousands of
People, who prov'd zealous Christians, nay even
Martyrs for the Christian Doctrine, would have
dy'd in the profess'd Paganism of the Britains.
Now 5tis evident, the invasion of the Romans
was an unjust, bloody, tyrannical Assault upon the
poor Britains,againstall Right and Property,against
justice and Neighbourhood, and meerly carry'd
on for Conquest and1 Dominion. Nor indeed had
the Romans any just Pretence of War; yet God
was pleased to make this Violence be the kindest
Thing that could have befallen the British Nation, since it brought in the Knowledge of God among
the Britainsy and was a Means of reducing a hea-
then and barbarous Nation to the Faith of Christ*
and to embrace the Messias.
Thus Heaven serves it self of Mens worst De-
signs, and the Avarice, Ambition, and Rage of
Men, have been made Use of to bring to pass the
glorious Ends of Providence, without the least
knowledge or Design of the Actors: Why then
may not the great Undertakings of the Princes of
Europe, if they could be brought to a& in Concert, with
^good Design to bring all the World, to open their
Doors to the Christian Religion, and by Conse-
quence their Ears? I fay, why may not such an
Attempt
1^6]
Attempt be blessed from Heaven with so much Success , at least as to make Way for bringing in nominal Christianity among the Nations? For as
to obliging the People to be of this or that Opini-
on afterward, that is another Cafe.
There is a great Pother made in the World a-
mong the several Denominations of Christians
about Coertion, erecting a Church, and compel-
ling Men to come in; that is to fay, one Sort of
Christians persecuting another Sort of Christians.*
to make them worship Christ their Way, as if
Christ had no Sheep but one Fold.
I distinguish much between using Force to re-
duce Heathens and Savages to Christianity, and
using Force to reduce those that are already Chri-
stians, to be of this or that Opinion; I will not
fay but a War might be very just, and the Cause
be righteous, to reduce the Worshippers of the Pa-
gods of India, to the Knowledge and Obedience
of Christianity, when it would be a horrible In-
justice to commence a like War, to reduce even
a Popish Nation to be Protestant.
But my proposed War does not reach so far as
that neither; for tho'I would have a Nation of Pa-
gans conquer'd, that their Idols and Temples
might be destroyed, and their Idol Worship be
abolished; yet I would be very far from punishing
and persecuting the People for not believing in
Christ: For if we believe that Faiths as the Scrip-
ture fays_is the Gift of God, (How can we upon
any Christian Foundation, punish or persecute the
Man for not exercising that which God had not
given him.
Hence, compelling Men to conform to this
or that particular Profession of the Christian Re-
ligion, is to me impious and unchristian.
» 1 ^' And
And shall I speak a Word here of the unhap-
py Custom among Christians, of reviling one
another ,with Words, on Account of differing O pinions in Religion: It was a Part of Apocryphal
Scripture, taken from one of the traditional Say-
ings of the Rabbies, Thoushalt not mock at the
Gods of the Heathens. But Ribaldry, Satyr, * 4tid
Sarcasms, are the Usage for give one another
every Day on the Subject of Religion; as if Slan-
der and the Severities of the Tongue, were not the
worst kind of Violence in matters of the Chri-
stian Religion.
In a Word, I must acknowledge, if J am to
speak of Reproach in general, I know no worse
Persecution than that of the Tongue; Solomon
says, *thereare that speak, like the piercing of a Sword;
and King David was so sensible of the Bitterness
of the tongue, that he is full of Exclamations
upon the subject ; among the rest, he fays of his
Enemies, 'They have compassed me about with wordsof Hatred. He clothedhimself with Cursing like as
with his Garment, Psalm cix. 3,18.
It is indeed remote from the subject I am upon,
to talk of this kind of uncharitable Dealing, but
as just Observations are never'out of season, it
may have its Uses: Let no Man slight the Hint,
tho' it were meant of Religion only, for that indeed
is my present subject *, there is doubtless as severe
a Persecution by the Tongue, as that of Fire and
Faggots and some think 'tis as hard to be born.
I have never met with so much of this any
where in all my Travels as in England, where the
Mouths of the several sects and Opinions are so
effectually'open against one another, that albeit
common Charity commands us to talk the best of
particular Persons in their Failings and Infirmi-

pose all those Offers to the firslr Comer in Banter
and Ridicule: But take me right too, I have seen
at the same Time, that to wiser Men it has been
always thought to be an exposing themselves, and
an Honour to the Person.
I speak this too feelingly and therefore fay no
more; there is a Way by Patience, to conquer
even the universal Contempt of Mankind; and
though two Drams of that drug be a Vomit
for a Dog, it is in my experience the only Me-
thod ; there is a secret Peace in it, and in Time
\the Rage of Men will abate, a constant steady
adhering to Vertueand Honesty, and shewing the
World, that whatever mistakes he might be led
into, supposing them to be Mistakes, that yet the
main Intention and Design of his Life, was sin-
cere and upright $ he that governs the actions of
Men by an Unbiassed Hand, will never suffer
such a Man to sink under the Weight of universal
Prejudice and Clamour.
I Robinson Crusoe, grown old in Afsti- ^
ction, born down by calumny and reproach, but
supported from within, boldly prescribe this Re-
medy against universal Clamours and Contempt of
Mankind; Patiepce, a steady Life of Vertue and
Sobriety, <a#d,a comforting Dependance on the
justice of Providence, will first x>r last restore the
Patient tp the Opinion of his Friends, and justify
him in thejFace pf his Enemies; and in the mean
time; will support him comfortably, in despising
those who Want Manners and Charity, and leave
them to be cussed from Heaven with their own
Paffiqns and rage. This
This very Thought made' me long ago claitfV
a kind of Property in some good old Lines of
the famous George Withers Esq; made in Prison
in the lUver; he was a poetical Gentleman, who
had in the Time of the Civil Wars- in England,
been unhappy in changing of Sides too often, and
and had been put into the 'sower by every S.de in
their Turn; once by the King, once by r,he Par*-
liament, once by the Army, then by the Rump,
and at last again, / think, by General Monk; in
a Word, what eye* Side got up> he had the Dis-
aster to be down, the Lines are thus:
The World and I may well agree,
< as most that are offendefl;
For J /light her, and floe flights me,
and there's our Quarrel ended,
For Service done and love exjpreft,
Tho9 very few regard rt>'
My Country owes me Bread at leap: t
But if Jam debarrd it,
Good Conscience is Or daily Feafly > >
and borrow never marred it.
But this Article of verbal* Persecution, has
hurried me from my Subject, which I must re-
turn to. , * f
I have Jpoken of a Project soothe Czar of Mus-
covy, wp^chy of a Monarch, who is Lord of so
vast ajasextent of Country, as the Ruffian Erfip're
reaches to,- which is in Effect as i have said,
rn^ch more than half Europe, and consequently an
eighth Pait of the World. I have given my
\ Thought* how a War 10 open a Door for the
Chrt-
I*11
Christian Religion may be justifiable.and thapt has
not,the least Tincture of Persecution in it: If the
Christian Princes of the Worlds, who now spend
their Force so much to an ill Purpose, in real Per-
secution, would join in an universal War against
Paganism and Devil-worship, the savage Part
Qjt Mankind wpuld in one Age, be brought to
bo^ their I^neesto the God ot Truth, and would
Jbless the Enterprise it self in the Exi4 of it, as
she best Thing that ever befel them: J^or could
such an Attempt fail of Success, unless Heaven in
Justice had determined to shut up the World lon-
ger in Darkness, * aiifi r/ie Cup of their Abomina-
tions was not yet full; But I may venture to fay,
there would be rnuph morp Ground for such
Christian Prinegs to hope and expect the Con-
crtrrence of Heaven in such an Undertaking, than
in sheathing their Swords in the Bowels pf
their Brethren, and making an Effusion of Chri-
.stiaa Blood upon every slight Pretence, as we fee
has been the Cafe in Europe for above thirty Years
past.N
I had intended to remark here, that as the
Country possessed by Christians is but a Spot of thp
Globe, compared to the Heathen, Pagan, and
Mahometan World; so the Number of real Chri-
stians among the Nations professing the Christian
Name, is yet a more difproportioned Part, a mere
^Trifllc, and hardly tO'be compared with the infi-
nite N umbers of those who tho'they call themselves
Christians, yet know as little of God and Reli-
gion as can be imagined to be known, where the
Word Christian is spoken of* and neither seek or
desire to know more; in a Word, who know but
Jittle of Qod or Jesus Christ, Jleaven or Hell, anfl
regard none of thcjn.
$ 3 TM$
This is alarge Field,and being througly searched
into, would I doubt not, reduce the real faithful
subjects of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, to a
much fewer number than those of Mahomet; nay,
than those of the Monarch of Germany \ and make
pur Lord appear a weaker Prince, speaking in the
Sense of Kingdoms, than many of the King's of
the Earth. And if it be true that the old King
of France should fay, That he had more loyal Sub-
jects than King Jesus ,* I do not know, but in the
Sense his Most Christian Majesty meant * it, the
^thing might be very true. . J
But this observation is something out of my
present Road, and merits to be spoken of by itself.
The number of true Christians will never be
known on this Side the great B^r, where they
shall be critically separated. No political Arith-
metick can make$ a Calculation of the Number
pf true Christians, while they live blended with
the false ones, since it is not only hard, but im-
possible to know them one from another in nether world, *Wer (hill perhaps be surprised at the last Day, to
se(£ tome: People at the Right-hand of the righ-
teous judge, whom we have condemned with
the utmost Zeal injour Opinions, while we were
(Contemporary with them in Life; for Charity,
as it is' generally practised in this World, and
mix^d with our human infirmities, such as Pride,
Self-opinion, aqd Personal-prejudide, is strangely
mis-guided," and makes us entertain Notions of
^Things and of People, quite different from what
they really deserve; and there is hardly any Rule
to~ prescribe ourselves,-except it be of the Text,
7n Meekness y every one esteeming other better than
themselves^ which by the way, is~ difficult to
But
But though we shall thus ,see at the great Au-
dit, a Transposition of Persons'from the^ Station
they held in-our charity, we shall only thereby
see that, our Judgment was wrong; that God
can not as Man judgeth,' and that 'we too
rashly condemn, whom he has thought fit to ju-
stify and accept. * '* \
Let then the number of Christians bfe more or
less, as he that makes them Christians determines,
this is not for us to enter into, and this brings
me back to what I saidr before, that though^ we
cannot make Christians, we both can and may, and
indeed ought to open the • Door to Christianity,
that the Preaching of GodVWord, which is the
, ordinary Means of bringing Mankind to the Know-
ledge of Religion, may be spread over the whole
world. With what Vigour do wfcx consult, and how do
the labouring Heads of the World club together
to form projects, and to*aise Subscriptions to
extend the general Commerce' of Natio&s > in-
to every corner of the world : But ^would pass for a bubble of all Bubbles, and a Whimsy
that none would engage in, if ten millions* should
'be asked to be subscribed, for 'sending a strong
Fleet and Army to conquer Heathenism and Ido-
latry, and protect a million of Christians, to be
employed in preaching the Gospel to the "poor
Heathens, fay it were on the Coast of Cormandel,
the Island of Ceylon and Country of Malabar^ or
any of the* Dominions of the Great Mogul, and
yet such an Attempt would not only be just, but
infinitely advantageous to the People who should
undertake it,' and to the People of the Country,
on whom the Operation should be wrought.
In the occafiofial Discourses I had on this
subject, in Conversation- with Men of £ood Judg-
S 4 ment
0*40
ment and. Principles, I have been often a$k'd
in what manner I would propose to carry on such
a Conquest as I speak of* and how it should an-
swer the End; and that I may not be supposed to suggest a Thing impracticable in itself or for
which no rational Scheme might be proposed; I
fliall make a brief Essay, at the Manner, in which the Conquest I speak of should be, or ought to be
carried on; and if it be considered s^ripusly, thp
Difficulties and perhaps all the reasonable Ob-
jections might vanish in an instant. I will there-
fore first, for the Purpose onlyy suppose that an At-
tempt was made by a Christian Nation, to con-
quer and subdue some Heathen or Mahometan Peo-
ple at a Distance from them, place the Conquest
where, and among whom we will: For Example) Suppose it was the great island of Madagascar,*orthat of Ceylon^Borneo in the Indies* of those of
Japan, or any other where you please.
I would first suppose, the Place to be infinite-
ly populous as any of those ^Countries, though
they are islands, are said to beand because the
Japaneseare said to be a most sensible sagacious
People, under excellent Forms of Government,
and capable more than ordinarily of receiving
Impressions, supported by the Argument and Ex-
ample of a vertuoiis and religious Conqueror,
For this purpose you must grant me, that the
Island or Islands of Japan were in a Situation
proper for the undertaking, and that a powerful
European Army being landed upon them, had in a
great'Battle or in divers Battles, over all their Military force, and had entirely re-
duced the whole Nation to theit Power: As to
go back to Examples, the Venetians had done by
the Turksin the Morea in a former War, or as
the 'Turks did in the Isles of Coda,Cyprus, and
the like. The short Scheme for establishing the
Government in those Countries should be this *
Fir#, As the War is pointed chiefly a-
gainst the Kingdom of the Devil, in
behalf of the Christian Worship, so
no Quarter should be given to Satan's
Administration; and as nothing else
should willingly be treated with Vio-
lence; so indeed no Part of the De-
vils OEconomy should have any Fa-
vour, but all the Idols should imme-
diately be destroyed, and publickly
. burnt, tall the Pagods and Temples
burnt, and the very Face and Form
of Paganism and the Worship attend-
ing it, be utterly defaced and de-
stroyed.
Secondly, The Pfiests and dedicated Alsons of every kind, by whatsoever
Names or Titles known or distin-
guished, should be at least removed,
if not destroyed.
Thirdly, All the Exercise of profane and
idolatrous Rites, Ceremonies, Wor-
ship, Festivals, and Customs, should
, 1 be aboliihed entirely, so as by Time to be forgotten, and clean wiped out
- of the Minds, as well as out of the
Practice of the People*
This is all the Cpertion I propose, and less than
this cannot be proposed, because though we may
not by Arms and Force compel»Men to be reli-
gipus, because if we do, we cannot make them
-''" — sincere,
sincere, and so by Persecution we only create Hy-
pocrites; yet I insist that we - may by Force,
and that with the greatest justice possible, sup-
press Paganism, ad theWorship o^ God's Enemy
the Devil, and banish it out of the world ; nay,
that we ought to do it to the utmost of our Power:
But I return to the Conquest.
The Country bfeingthus entirely reduced under
Christian Government, the inhabitants if they
submit quietly, ought to be used with Humanity
and Justice no Cruelty, no Rigour they should suffer no Oppression, Injury, or injustice, that
they may not receive evil Itppre#fons!of the Peo-
ple that are come among them; lest entertaining an
abhorrence of Christians, from their evil conduct, Cruelty, and injustice, they should entertain an Ab-
horrence of the Christian Religion for their sakes; as the poor Wretches the Indians in America, who
when they were talked to of the Future State,
'the Resurrections the Dead, Eternal Felicity in
Heaven, and thejike, epquir'd where the Spaniards
went after Death, and if any of them went to
Heaven? and being answered in the affirmative, Ihook their heads, and desired they 'might go to
Hell then, for that they were; afraid to, think of
being in Heaven, if the Spaniardswere there.
A just and * generous Behaviour to the Natives
or at least to such of them as "should show them-
selves willing to submit, would certainly engage
them in their interest, and accordingly would in
a little while bring them to embrace that Truth,
which dictated such just Principles to those who
espoused it.
Thus prejudices being removed, the Way to In-
struction would be made the more plain, and then
would be the Time for Gospel-Labourers to enter
upon the Harvest i Ministers should be instructed
to
to teach them our language, "to exhort them tq
seek the Blessings of Religion and of the true
God, and so gradually to introduce right Prin-
ples among them at their own Request.
From hence they should proceed, to teach all
the young Children the language spoken by them,
who would then be their benefactors, rather than
Conquerors, and a few Years wearing the old Ge-
neration out, the.Posterity of them, and of their
conquerors, would be all one Nation.
In Cafe any*rejected the Instruction of religious
Men, and adher d obstinately to his Idolatry, and
Would not be reclaimed by gentle and christian U-
sage, suitable Methods are to be taken with such, that they might not make a religious faction in the
Country, and gain others to side with them, in
order to recover their Liberty, as they might call it
to serve their own Gods, that is to fay Idols ,* for
it must be for ever as just, not to permit them to go
back to Idolatry by Force, as it was to pull
them from it by Force.
By this kind of- Conquest, the Christian Reli-
gion would be most effectually propagated among
innumerable Nations of Savages and Idola-
ters, and as many People be brought to worship
the true God, as may be said to do it at this Time
in the whole Christian world. This is my Cruisadoy and it would be a War as
justifiable on many Accounts, as any that was ever
undertaken in the World, a War that would bring
Eternal Honour to the Conquerors, and an Eternal
Blessing to the People conquers.
It were easy now to cut out Enterprises of this
Nature for other of the Princes of the World than
the Czar of Muscovy; and I could lay very ratio-
nal Schemes for such Undertakings, and the
Schemes that could, if througiy pursued never
fail
fail of success : For Example, An Expedition
against the Moors of Africa, by the French, Spanish
and Italian Princes, who daily suffer so much by
them, and the last of whom are at perpetual War
with them *, how easy would it be to those
Powers to join in a Christian Confederacy, to
plant the Christian Religion ,again in the Numi-*- *
dian and Mauritanian Kingdoms; where was once
the famous Church of Carthage, and from whence
Thousands of Christians have gone to Heaven;
The Harvest of the primitive Labours of St. Cypian, Tertullifm, and many more, whos? Poste*-
rity now bow their Knees tp tha*t latest and worst
of all Impostors., Mahomet*
But unchristian Strife was always a Bar against
the Propagation of Christian Religion, and unna-
rural Wars carried on among the Nations I speak
of, are made so much the business of the Christian
World, that I do not expect in our Time, to fee
the Advantages taken hold of, that the Nature of
the Thing offers : But I am persuaded,, and leave itupon Record as my settled Opinion, that ^one
Time or other, the Christian Powers of Europe,
&all be inspired from Heaven for such a Work,
and then the Easiness of subduing the Kingdom of
Africa to the Christian Power, shall shame the Ge-
nerations past, who had the Qpportunity so often -
in their Hands, but made no Use of it.
Note, In this Part of the subject I am upon, I
must acknowledge there is a double Argument
for a War: i. In Point of the interfering Interests>
Europe ought to take possession of those Shoars,
without which it is manifest her Commerce is not
secured; and indeed, while that Part of Africabordering on the Sea, is in the Hands of Robbers*
Pyrates cannot be secured: Now, this is a Point
of undisputed right, for $ War-Trade claims th$
Protection of the Powers to whom it belongs, and
we make no scruple to make War upon one ano-
ther, for the protection of our Trade, anctit is
allowed to be a good Reason why we should do
so. Why then is it not a good Reason to make
War upon Thieves and Robbers? If one Nation
takes the Ships belonging to another, we imme-
diately reclaim the Prize from the Captors, and
require of the Prince, that justice be done against
the aggressor, who is a Breaker of the Peace;
and if this is refused, we make War.
But shall we do- thus to Christians, and scruple
to make an universal War for the rooting out a
Race of Pyrates and Rovers who live by Rapin,
and are continually .employed like the Lions and
Tygers of their own Lybia in devouring their
Neighbours: This, I fay, makes such a War not
only just on a religious Account, but both just
and necessary upon a civil Account. ^
The War then being thus proved to be just on
other Accounts, why should not 2. The Extir-
pation of Idolatry, Paganism, and Devil-Worship,
be the Consequence of the Victory. If God be
allowed to be the Giver of Victory, how can it
„be answered to him, that the victory should not
be made Use of, for the Interest and Glory of
the God of War, from whom it proceeds? But
these Things are not to be offered to the World, till higher Principles work in the Minds of Men,
in their making War and Peaee, than yet seems to
take up their Minds.
I was tempted upon this Occasion, to make an
Excursion here,' upon the Subject of the very
light Occasions, Princes and Powers, States and
Statesmen make use of, for the engaging in War
and Blood one against another ; one for being ill
satisfied with the other, and another for preserving
the
E *7<0
the Balance of Power ; this for nothing at-«all$
and that for something next to nothing; and how
little Concern the, Blood that is 1 necessarily spilt
in these wars produces among them: but this is
not a Cafe that will so well bear, to be entered upon in a publick manner at this time. All I can add is, I doubt, no such Zeal for the
Christian Religion, will be found in our Days, or
perhaps in any Age of the, World, tilLHeaven beats
theDrumsitselfjand the gloriousLegionsfrom above
come down on Purpose to propagate the Work, and
to reduce the whole World to the Obedience of
King Jesus i a Time which some tell us is not far
off: but of which I heard nothing in all my Travels
and Illuminations,' no not one Word. *

with the Satisfaction of what they are already, that never spare
their Thoughts upon the subject of what they shall be.
The Place, the Company, the
Employment which we expect t<$
know so much of hereafter, must certainly be well
worth our while to enquire after here.
I believe the main Interruptions which have
been given to these Enquiries and perhaps the
Reason why those that have entered into them

As I endeavor edconceive Jail of thdk
No things, I £haU;Hfewise eadeavour to reason upon
them clearly, and, if possible, convey some such
Ideas of the invisible World to the Thoughts of
Men, as may not be confused and indigested, and
so leave them darker than I find them.
The Locality of Heaven or Hell is no Part of my Search; there is doubtless a Place reserved
for the Reception of our souls after Death; as
there is'a State of Being for material substances, so there must be a place,- if we are to BE, we
must have a where; the Scripture supports Rea-
son in it, Judas is gone to his Place, Dives in
Hell lift up his Eyes, and saw* Laz>arm in Abraham'sBosom; the 'Locality of Bliss and Misery
seems to be positively asserted in both Cafes,'
But there is not so clear a View of the Company
as of the Place; it is not so easy to enquire into
the World of Spirits, as it is evident that there
are sueK Spirits, and such a World $ we find the
Locality of it is natural, but who the Inhabitants
are5iis/a Search of still a sublimer Nature^ liable
to more Exception, encumbered with more Dif-
ficulties, and exposed to much more uncertainty. I shall endeavour to clear up as much of it as
I can, and intimate most willingly, how much I
tfejoyce in the expectation, that some other En-
quirers may go farther, 'till at last, all that Pro tidence has thought fit to discover of that Pare

'The
[2J
The Discoveries in the Scripture \frhic head
to this, ape innumerable; but the positive Decla-
ration of it seems to be declined. When our Sa-
viour walking onthe sea^ frightpd his Disciples*
md they cried out, what do we*sin4 ferrify'd
them? Truly, they thought they' re, a Spi-
rit. One would have thought such Men as they,
who had the Vision of God manifest in theFlejb$
should not have been , so niuch surpriz'd, if they
had open a Spirit, that, is to say, seen an Afpariuon;
for to see a Spirit, seems to be an Allusion* not
an Expression to be used literally, a Spirit being
not visible by the organ of human sight. But what if it had been a spirit? , if it had
been a good spirit,* what had,they to fear? And
if a bad Spirit* whap would crying out have as-
sisted thcm^? When People cry out in such Cases*
it is either for help, and then they cry to others 5
or for mercy, and then the^ery to the subject of their Terror to spare them. Either Way it
Was either the foolifhest, or the wickedest Thing
that ever wa& done by such grave Men,as the
Apostles; for if it was a good Spirit, as,beforei
they had no need, to cty out,- and if it 5was a bad
one, who did they cry to? For tis evident they
did not pray to God, *or cross and' bldss theme selves, as <was afterwards the fashion ; but they
tried ot&, th^t is to say,4 they either cried out (ot
Help, whish, was great Nqpjfe^se, to call to Man
for Help against, the Devilor 4they cried to the
Spirit.they saw, that it might not hurt them,
which was, in short, tneitEcr less, or more, than praying to the Devil. \
This put me in "Mind of the poor savages Ger many of the Countries of America and Africa, who really instructed by their Fear, that is to fay, by
tneer Nature, worship the Devil, that he may not
hurt them, A a Here
Here I must digress a little, and make a Trail-
sitiori from the Story of i Spirit, tb the strange
Absurdities of Mkns Notions at thit Tirri&; and
particularly, of'those upon wh&ncrthe first Im-
pressions of (Shrills I*readhing(4 s were wrought^
and if k lodfc'd narrowly into, one cannot but
wonder^what fttange igilorant People/ even the
Diseipfefc Themselves' were, at first; and' indeed
theit I^n<6rance continued a great while, even
to after the Death of Christ himself,* witness the
foolish Talk of the two disciples going to Emam,
It is*true they were wiser afterwards when they, were better taught; but the Scripture is full of
the Discoveries of their ignorance j as in the No-
tions of'sitting at his Right-hand and his Left, in
his Kingdom, ask'd'for by Zebkdetfs Childreh; No doubt but the good Woman their Mother thought
one of her Sons sliduld be Lbrd Treasurer there, and the t'other Lord Chancellor, and (he could
not but think those Places their Due, when (he
saw them in such Favour with him here. Just so
in their Notion of seeing a Spirit here, which
put them into such a'fright, and indeed they^might be said, according to our dull Way of
Talking, to be frighted out of t heir Wits; For
had their Senses been in Exercise, they would ei-
ther have'rejoie'd in the appearance of a good
Angel, and stood still to hear his message, as
from Hedven; or prayed to God to deliver them
out of the Hands of the Devil, on their supposing
it, as above, to be a Vision from Hell
But I come to the Subject. It is evident that
the Notion of Spirits, and their intermeddlirl^
With the Affairs of Men, and even of their spear ihg to Meni ftfevaiVd so universally in those
Ages of the World, that even God's own people, who were instructed from himself, believ'd it,
not
aor i$~ there any Thing in all the Old Testament
Institution to contradict it, tho* many Things
to confirm it; such particularly, as the Law
against what is called a familiar Spirit, which
was esteem'd n8 better or worse than a conver-
sing with the Devil, that is to say, with some
of the evil Spirits of the World I' speak of.
The Witch of Endor, and the Story -of an Ap-
parition of an old Man personating Samuels which
is so plainly asserted in Scripture," and' which'the
learned Opposers of these Notions have spent so
much weak Pains to disturb' our Imaginations
about, yet assure us, that siich Apparitions are
not inconsistent with Nature, or with Religion;
nay, the Scripture allows thisWoman to Paw waw,
as the Indians in America call it, and conjure for
the raising this Spectre, and whpn it is come, al-
lows it to speak a great prophetick Truth, fore-
telling the King in all its terrible Particulars what
was to happen to him, and what did befal him
the very next Day.
Either this Appearance must be a good Spirit,'
or a bad; if it was a good Spirit, it was au
Angel, as it is expressed in another Place of the
Apostle Peter, when he knock'd at the good
People's Door in JerusalemyAEls xii.ij. and then it
supports my Opinion of the Spirits unembodied
.conversing with, and taking Care of the Spirits
embodied; if it was an evil Spirit, then they
must grant God to be making a Prophet of the
Devil, and making him personate Samuel to foretel
Things to come; permitting Sathan to speak in the
first Person of God's own Prophet, and indeed to
preach the Justice of God's Dealing with Saul, for
rejecting his Prophet Samuel; which in, short, isnot
g, little odd, putting the Spirit of Cod into the
A 3 MourJ*
Mouth of the Pevil, and making Sathan ^
Preacher of Righteousness.
'When I was irj my Retirement, I had a-
bundance of strange potions of my seeing Ap-
paritxons^ there? and especially when I hap-
pen d to Jpe abroad by Moon-shine, when every
Bush Joqk'd like a Man, and every Tree like a

as I do now really belieye.and £pi aflur'd, that it

But howpvpr, th^t the Reader may fee how
fay the Power of Imagination may go, and judge
for me whether I stiew'4 any niore Fol,ly and Sim-
plicity jhfn oth^r* l^ten mjght do, I'll repeat some
little passages, wh|ch fgr a while gave rme very
great Disturbances^ and every one shall judge foe
me, whg^her they nfigj^t not have been deluded in
t;he like Circumstances a§ well as L
Tl>$ first Cafe wa§,: when 5 crept into the dark
Cav£ in >the Valley, whpre the pld Goat lay just
expiring, which,* wherever it happened, is a true,
pistory, ,1 asfee pi*., \ 
When-first I was,stqpp'4 by theNpise of this
poor dying Creatures you are to observe, that
the? Voice was npt only jike the Voice of a Man,
fcvit, e\jqn articulate^ fonIy tfeat I could not form
any Words from it>< and what did that amount to
mote pr \pls th§p[ jthis, namely, that it spoke,
bSut only it was in* 3 Language that I did not un~
dqrstan^* If it vqas, po$ye to (describe the Sur-
prise o"f^ my Spirits* on 'that Occasion, I would do
i* Wei how all my BlcJod run> or rathersioodstilly
~ chilld
chlll'd in my veins; how a cold Dew of Sweat
fat on my Forehead *> how my Joints* like BeIJhazr
zqr^s K^tiees, some one against another; and how,
as I said, my Hair would have lifted off my Hat,
if I had had one on my Head.
But this is not all. After the first Noise of the
Creature which was a faint dying Kind of imper-
fect Bleating, not unusual, as I found afterwards I
fay, after this, he fetch'd two or three deep Sighs
as lively, and as like human, as it is possible to
imagine, as I have also said.
These were so many Confirmations of my Sur-
prize, besides the Sight of his two glaring Eyes,
and carried it up to the Extreme of Fright and Amazement; how I afterwards conquered this
childish Beginning, and mustered up Courage e-
nough to go into the Place5 with a firebrand for
light ; and how I was presently satisfy *d with
seeing the Creature whose'condition made all the
little accidental Noises appear rational, I have
already said'.
But I must acknowledge, that this real Surprize
left some Relzcks or Reftiains:behind it, that did
not wear quite off agreat while,tho'Istruggl'd hard
with them, : The Vapours that were raised, at first
were neyer so laici, but that on every trifling Oc-
casion they returned; and* I saw, nay, I felt Ap-
paritions," as plainly and distinctly as ever I felt
or saw any real Substance in my Life.
The like was >the Cafe with me before that,
when I first found vthfc Print 9s a Man s Foot up on the Sand, by the Seaside on the North Part of
the Island." * ' *\v
And there' s, having left my Fancy ta little
peevish and Wijwkrd, I had frequently some Re-
turns of: Vhese^\Krfp6ur's' on differing Occasions,
and /bmetimes even without Occasion; nothing
A 4 but
but meer Hypochondriack Whimsies, fluttering of
the Blood, and rising of Vapours/ which nobody
could give any Account of but myself.;
For Example: It was overnight, after my having
seen some odd Appearances in the Air, of no great
Significance, that coming home and being in Bed,
but not asleep, I feltPain in one of my Feet; afr
ter which it came to 3, kind of Numb chiefs in my
Foot, which a little surpriz'd me3' and after that, a
kind of Tingling in my Blood, as if it had been
some Distemper running up my Leg. s'
On a sudden I felt, as it were, something alive
lye upon me, as if it had been a Dog lying up on my Bed, from my Knee downwards about half
Way my Leg, and immediately afterwards I felt
it heavier, and felt it as plainly roll itself upon me
upwards uppij my Thigh, for I lay-on ~one Side;
I fay, as if it had been a creature lying upon me
with all his Weight, and turning his Body upon
me. v '.
It was so lively and sensible to me, and I re-
member it so perfectly well, though it is now
many Years ago, that my BJogd chills and flutters
about my heart at the very writing it«; I 'imme^
diately stung my self out of my bed, and flew to my Musquet, which "stood always re&dy"at my
Hand, and, naked as I was, laid about me upoti
the Bed in the dark, and every wl>ere-elFe that Icould think of where any Body might st^d Pf Jot, but could find nothing. Lord dfiiyer me srdte an
evil spirit,said I! What can this be ? And b^g
tired with groping about, and having broke two
or three of my Earthen Pots with making BIqws
here and there to no purpose, I went to light my
. Candle, Tor my Lamp which lus'd to burn in the
night either had not been lighted, pf w£$ gone
• 'ythtn
When I lighted a Candle, I could easily see
there was no living Creature in the Place with
me, but the poor Parrot, who was wak'd and
frighted, and cry'd out, holdyour Tongue, and*
What's the Matter with Youf Which Words he
learn'd of me, from my frequent: faying so to him,
when he used to make his ordinary wild Noise and
screaming that I did not like. A The more I was satisfy'd that there was nothing
{in the room,' at least to be seen, the more another
concern came upon me. Lord! fyys I aloud, this
is the Devil. Hold your Tongue, fays Ppll. I was
so mad at the Bird, tho3 the Creature knew no-
thing of the Matter, that if he had hung near
me, I believe I should have killed him. I put my
Clothes on, and fat me down, for I could not find
'in, my Heart to go to Bed again> and as I fat down, / am terribly frighted, said I. What'sthe
Matter with you? says Poll. You^Toad, said I, I'dknock your Brains out if you were here. Koldyotlr
Topgue, fays he again, and then fell to chattering,
Rabin1' Crusoe, and, Poor Robin Crusoe, as he used ~
to do.
Had I been in any Reach of a good Temper, it
had been enough to have composed me; but I
was quite gone, I was fully possessed with a Belief,
that it was the Devil, and I pray'd most heartily
xo God, to be delivered from the Power of the
evil Spirit:
After some Time, I composed my self a little,"
and went to bed again, and lying just in the Po-
sture as I was in before, I felt a little of the Ting-
ling in my blood which I felt before, and I re-
folv'd to lye still, let it be what it would> it
came up as high as my I£nee5' as before*, but no
£jigher; and now I began to feel plainly that it was
$11 a Distemper, that it was something Paralitick;
"aw*
and that affected the Nerves ; but I had not ei-
ther Experience ofsuch a thing, or knowledge of Diseases, enough to be fully, satisfy 9d of the Na-
ture of them, and whether any thing natural, any
Numbedness or Dead Palsie affecting one Part of
theThigh, could feels that did; till some Months
after that, I felt something of the very same again
at my first lying down in my Bed for three of four 1
Nights together^vhdefrat first gave me a little con-; pern as a Distemper,- but at l^iftgaye me such Sa-/
refaction, that the fast was nothing but the fame
thing in a higher" Degree; that the pleasure of
knowing it was only a Disease, w^ far beyond the
Concern at the danger of it ,* Thb* a dead Palsie
to one in'my condition might reasonably have been one of the most frightful Things in Nature; since
having no body to help me, I must have inevitably
perish d for me^r Want of Food, pot being able to
go from place" to place to fetch it.
But to go back to the Case in Hafid, #nd to
the Apprehension I had been in/ all the several
Months that passed between the first of this$ and
* the last, I went about with a melancholy heavy Heart, fully satisfy9d that the Qcvil had beep' in
my room, and lay upon myBecl.
Sometimes I would trye to argue my self a little
cut of m asking my self. Whether it was reason-
able to imagine the $)evil had nothing else to do
than to come thither,' and onlyjye down upon
me, and go away about his Busitiess^ and fay not
one Word tome? What End it could answer ? and
whether I thought the Devil was really busy'd
about such Trifles? Qr whether he had not Em-
ployment enough of a^hjgher Nature, so that such
a thing "as that could be worf h his while?
But still tlitShMl was answered with my own
r TKo^ghts/rettoing thus," Whkt could it be? Ot,1
if
|f it was not a Devil, what was it? This I could
pot answer by any Means at all; and so I still funk
under the Belief, that it was the Devi], and no-
thing But the Devil.
You may be sure, while I had this Fancy in my
Head, I was of Course over-run with the Vapours,
^nd had all the Hypochondriack Fancies that eves
any melancholy Head could entertain; and what
with ruminating on the Print of a Foot upon the
Sand, and the Weight of the Devil upon me in my
Bed, I made no Difficulty toconclude,that the Old
Gentleman really visited the Place; and in a Word*
it had been easy to haye possessed me, if Iliad con-
tinued so much longer, that it was an enchanted
Island, that there were a Million of evil Spirits in
it, and that the Devil was Lord of the Manor.
I scarce heard the least Noise;, near or far off,
but rstartedj and expected to see a Dtvil; every
distant Buih upon a Hill, if I did not particularly
remember it before, was a Man, and every Stump,
an Apparition; and I scarce went twenty Yards
together by Night or by Day, without looking
behind me.
Sometimes indeed I took a little Heart, and
would fay welt, let it be the Devil if it will, God
is Master of the Devil, and he can do me no Hurt,
unless he is permitted > he can be no where, but
he that made hifn is there too; and as I said aster-,
wards, when I was frighted with the old Goat
in a Cave, he is not fit to live all alone in such an
Island for 2Q Years that would be afraid to fee the
Devil. * *
But all these Things lasted but a short while,
and the Vapours that were raised ac first, were not
to be laid lo easily,; for, in a Word, it was not
jneer Imagination, but it was the. Imagination
Ws'd up to Disease : Nor did it ever quite wear
off
foflf till I got my Man Ryday with me, of whom
I have said so much; and then having Company
to talk to, the Hypo wore off, and I did not m any more Devils after that.
Before I leave this Part, I cannot but give a Caq-
tion to all vapourish melancholy People, whose i paginations run this way j Imean, about feeing
the Devil, Apparitions, and the like; namely, that
they should never IoqJc behind them, and over their
shoulders as they go up Stairs, or look into the \
corners and Holes of Rooms with a Candle m
theij: Hantds, or turn about to see who may be be-
hind them in any Walks or dark Fields, Lanes, or
the'like a' for let such k'nqw, they will seethe Devil
whether he be there or no ; nay, they will be so
perfwaded* that they do see him, that their very
imagination will be a Devil to them where-ever
they go. But after all this is said, let nobody suggest*
that because the brain-lick Fancy, the vapourish
Pypochondriapk Imaginatiop represents Spe$res
$nd Spirits to us, and makes Apparitions for us,
that therefore there are no such Things as Spirits
^both good and evil, any more than we should con-
* ceive that there i$ no Devil, because we do not
fee him.' (
The Devil has Witnesses of his Being and Na-
ture, fast as God himself has of his i they are not
indeed so visible or so numerous, but we are all
able to bripg Evidence of the Existence of the
Devil from aur own Frailties,1 as we are to bring
Evidence of the Existence of God from the Facul-
ties of our Souls, £nd*fr©m 'the Contexture of our
ftodies. .
As our Propensity to Evil rather than good, is
a Testimony (of ab original Depravity of ;tiuman
Nature j so the Harmony between the inclination and
and the occasion, is a Testimony which leatf<$
the Presence of the evil Spirit with us out of Que-
stion.
Not that the Devil is always the Agent in our
Temptations j for tho' th£ Devil is a very dili-
gent Fellow, and always appears ready to fall
in with the allurement, yet the Scripture clears
him^ and we must do so too, of being the main
Tempter; 'tis our own corrupt debauch'd In-
clination which is the first moving Agent; and
therefore the Scripture fays, A Man is tempted
when he is drawn away of his own Lujisy andenticed*
The Devil who, as I said, is a very diligent Fel-
low in the infernal Work, and is always ready to
forward the Mischief, is also a very cunning
Fellow, and knows how most dextroufly to suit
alluring objects to the allurable Dispositions; td
procure ensnaring Things, and lay them in the Way of the Man whom he finds so easy to be fenw
snar'd, and he never fails to prompt all the Mis-
chief can, full of stratagem and Art to en-
snare us by the Help of our corrupt affections and theft are call'd Sathans Devices.
But having charg'd Sathan home in that part* I must do the Devil that justice, as to own, that
he is the most slandered, most abns'd Creatitr^
alive; Thousands of Crimes we lay to his Charge
that he is not guilty of; Thousands of our own
Infirmities we load him with which he has no
Hand in; and Thousands of our sins, which, as bad as he is, he knows nothing of; calling him our Tempter, and pretehding we did so and so*
as the Devil would have it, when on the contrary
the Devil had no Share in it, and we were only
led away of our own Ltifis\ and enticed.
But now, having made this Digression in the Devil s Defence, I return to the mm Question^ that,

oFthe being of the Devil, and of evil Spirits Ma this^ I believe, there is no Room to doubt of; but this, as I have observed, is not the Thing; these are
not the spirits I am speaking of, but I shall come
directly to what I mean, and peak plaih without
£ny Possibility of being misunderstood:
I make no question, but that there is not only a World of Spirits, but that • there is a certain
knowledge of it3 the/ to us impossible as to the
Manner of it sfthfcre is a certain Converse between
the Woild* ofv Spirits, and the 'Spirits in this
world that is to fay, between Spirits uncased or
bnembodyM, and Souls of Men embody'd or cased
bj> inFlesli and Blood,as weail are on this sideDeath,
w It is true,1 that we cannot describe this Con-
verse of Spirits, as to the Way of it, the Manner
of the Communication, or how things are mutu-
ally convey'd from one to another. How Int&li-
fehees ate given or receiv'd we know not i we
now but little of their being convey?d this TVay3
from the 5j#m$ tmembody'd, to ours that are in
life ; and of their being conveyM. that way,name-
ly, from, us to them; of that we know nothing s
The latter certainly is done without the Help bf
the Organ, the former is cohvey'd by the Under-
standing, and the retired Faculties of the Soul, of
which we can give very little account. For Spirits, without the help Invoice,converse*
Let me, however, give, as Reasons for my Opi-
nion, some Account of the Consequences of this
Converse of Spirits ; I mean such as are quite re mote from what*We call Apparition or appearance of Spirits ; and I omit these, because I know they
are objected much against, and they bear, much
scandal from the frequent Impositions of our Fan-
cies
Understandings, as above.
But the more particular, Discoveries of this Con-
verse of Spirits, and which to me are undeniab e,
aresuch as follows namely, -
- Noises,' Apprehensions
Dreams are dangerous Things to talk ofJ and
we have such dreaming about them, that indeed
the least Encouragement to lay any Weight upon
'em, is presently carried away by a sort of People
that dream waking; and that run into such wild,
Extreams about them, that indeed we ought to
be very cautious what we fay of them.
..It is certain, Dreams of old were the Ways by
which God himself was pleased to warn Men, as
well what'to do, as what not td do ; what Ser-
vices to perform^ what evils to shun. Joseph, thd
husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was ap-
peared to in both these, Matt.iu 13.19. He was
directed of God, in a dream/ to go into Egypt,
ahd he was bid return out of" Egypt in a Dream;
and in the fame Chapter, the' Wife-men of the
East were warn'd if God in dtireafn, to depart into
their own Country another Way, to avoid*1 the
Wvftyoi Herod. ~
Now as this, and-innumerable-tnstances thro' the
whole Scripture, confirm, that1 God did once make
use of this Manner to convey knowledge and In-'
struction^to Men, I wish I could have this Que-
stion well answered, (as) Why are we nowto dfe
re$ Feopk to take %o Notice os their Dreams?
Dreams, Impulses,
Voices, Hints,
Involuntary Sad-
ness, &c.
But£r<S3 ,
But farthers it appears that th& was nott onl^
the Method God himself took by his immediate
Power, but 'tis evident he made use of it by the
Ministry of Spirits; the Scripture fays in both the
Cafes ot Joseph above-nam'd, That the Angel of the
Lord appear d to Joseph in a Dream. Now every
unembody'd Spirit is an Angel of the Lord'in
some Senses and* as Angels and Spirits may,be the
fame thing in respect of this Influence upon us in
Dreams, so it is still; and when any Notice for
Good, or Warning against Evil, is given us in a
Dream, I think 'tis no Arrogance at all for us to
fay, the Angel of the Lord appeared to us in a
Dream ,• or to fay, some good Spirit gave me.
Warning of this in a Dream; take this which
Way you will.
That I may support this with such undeniable
'Arguments, drawn from Examples of th$ Fact, as
no Man will, or reasonably can oppose, S first ap*
peal to the Experience of observing People^ I
mean such People as observe these things without
a superstitious Dependence upon the Signification
of them, that look upon Dreams but with such
a moderate Regard to them, as may direct to a
right Use of them 2 The Question I would ask of
such is, Whether they have never found any re-
markable Event of their Lives so evidently fore-
told them by a Dream, as that it must of Neces-
sity be true, that some invisible Being foresaw the'
Event* and gave them Notice of it? And that
had that Notice been listened to, and the natural
Prudence used, which would have been used if it
Jiad been certainly discovered> that evil Event
jnight have been prevented?
I would ask others^ whether they have not, by
Dreams, been so warn'd of Evil really approach-
ing, as that taking the Hint, and making "use of
iht
the Caution given in those Dreams the Evil hat been avoided. If I may speak my own Expe-
rience, I must take leave to say, That I never had
any capital Mischief befel me in my Life, but I
have had Notice of it by a Dream; and if I had
not been that thoughtless unbelieving Creature, which I now would caution other, People against,
I might have taken many a Warning, and avoided
many of the Evils that I afterwards fell into,
merely by a total obstinate Neglect of those
Dreams.
In like Manner, I have in some of the greatest
Distresses of my Life, been encouraged to believe
firmly and fully, that I should one Time or other
be delivered $ and I must acknowledge, that in my
greatest and most hopeless Banishment, I had such
frequent Dreams of my Deliverance, that I al-
ways entertained a firm and satisfying Belief* that
my last Days would be better than my first; all
which has effectually come to pass.
From which I cannot determine, as I know some
doy that all Dreams are meer Dosings of a deli-
rious Head, Delusions of a waking Devil, and Re-
licts of the Day's Thoughts, and Perplexities,
Or Pleasures: Nor do I fee any Period of Time
fixed between the two opposite Circumstances;
namely, when Dreams were to be esteemed the
Voice of God, and when the Delusion of the
Devil.
I know some have struggled hard to fix that
particular Article, and to fettle it as a Thing go-
ing hand in hand with the Jewish Institutions; as if
the Oracle ceasing in the Temple with the Con-
summation of the typical law, all the methods which Heaven was pleased to take in the former Times for revealing his Will to Men, were to cease
also at the same Time, and the Gospel Re vela-
B b' tioti
tion being fully and effectually supplied by the
Mission of the Holy Spirit, Dreams and all the
Uses and Significations of Dreams were at an
End, and the Esteem and Regard to the Warn-
ings and Instructions of Dreams was to expire
also*
But the Scripture is Point-blank against this,
in the History of fact relating to Ananias,and
the Conversion of St. Paul; and in the Story of
St. Peter and Cornelius the devout Centurion at
Antioch; both of them eminent instances of God's
giving Notice of his Pleasure to Men, by the In-
terposition or Medium of a Dream. The first of
these is in ABs ix. 10. There was ascertain Dis-
ciple at Damascus named Ananias, To him said the
Lord in a vision,&c. the Words spoken in this Vi-
sion to Ananias, directing to go to seek out one
Saul of Tarsus, go on thus v.n. And hath seen in
a vision,a Man named Ananias coming in,The other Passage is of St. Peter and Cornelius
the Centurion, ABs 10. v. 3, 10, 11. in the third
Verse it is said, Cornelias Fasting and Praying,
saw a vision,which afterwards in the 22d Verse,
is called an holy Angel.warning him,in the 30th
Verse it is said, a Man stood before me in bright
Cloathing; at the same Time, v. 10, it is said,
St. Peter was praying and fell into a trance; this
we all agree to be a possession of Sleep or a deep
Sleep; and in this Trautlce 'tis said, he saw Hea-
ven opened, that is to fay, he dreamed that he saw
Heaven opened; it could be nothing else; for
no Interpreters will offer to insist that Heaven
was really opened \ also the hearing a Voice, T. 13,
15. must be in a Dream; thus'cis apparent the
Will of God concerning what we are to do or not
to do, what is or is not to befal us, is and has
been thus conveyed by Vision or Dream, since the
Expn
Expiration of the Levitical Dispensation, and since
the Mission of the Holy Ghost.
When then did it cease? and if we dd not
know when it ceased, how then ar<^ we sure it is
at all ceased, and what Authority have we now
to reject all Dreams or Visions of the Night, as they
are called, more than formerly?
I will not fay, but there may be more noctur-
nal Delusions now in the World, than there were
in those Times; and perhaps the Devil may have
gain'd more upon Mankind itt these Days, than
he had then, though we are not let into those
Things enough, to know whether it is so or not;
nor do we know, that there were not as many un-
signifying Dreams in those Days as now, and per-
haps as much to be said against depending upon
them; though I think there is not one Word in
Scripture said, to take off the regard Men might
give to Dreams, or to lessen the Weight which
they might lay on them.
The only Text that I think looks like it, is, the
Flout Joseph's Brethren put upon him, or throw, out at him, when they were speaking of him with
Contempt, Genesis xxxvii. 19. Behold this Dreamer
cometh j and again, v. 20. Let us flay him and cast
him into some Pit, and we shall see what will becomeof his Dream s.
This indeed looks a little like the present Lan-
guage against Dreams \ but even this,is sufficiently
rebuked in the Consequences, for those Dreams of Joseph's did come all to pass, ^.nd proving the su-
perior Influence such Things have upon the Affairs
of Men, in spight of all the Contempt they can
cast upon them.
The Maxim I have laid down to my self for
my conduct in this Affair is in few Words, that
Bb 2 yr&
•we should not lay too great Stress upon Dreams,
and yet not wholly neglect them.
I remember, I was once present, where a long
Dispute was warmly carried on between two
Persons of my Acquaintance upon this very Sub-
ject, the one a Layman, the other a Clergyman,
but both very pious and religious Persons: The
first thought there was no heed at all to be
given to dreams, that they could have no justi-
fiable Original, that they were Delusions and no
more, that it was Atheistical to lay any Stress up-
on them, and that he could give such objections against them, as that no Man of good Principles
could avoid being convinced by that as to their
being a Communication from the invisible to the
visible World, 'twas a Chimæra, and that he saw
no Foundation for believing any Reality in such a
Thing, unless I would set up for a Co Limbus
or Purgatory, which had no Foundation in the
Scripture.
i. He said, If Dreams were from the Agency
of any prescient Being, the Notices would be, more direct, and the Discoveries clear; not by
allegories and emblematick Fancies, expressing
Things imperfect and dark: For to what Purpose
fiiould Spirits un-etabodied sport with Mankind,
warning him of approaching Mischiefs by the
most ridiculous Enigmas, Figures, &c. leaving
the Wretch to guess what awaited him, though
of the utmost consequence, and to perish if
he mistook the Meaning of it; and leaving
him sometimes perfectly at a Loss, to know
whether he was Right or Wrong, and without any
Rule or Guide to walk by in the 'most difficult
Cafes.
2. He
%. He objected, that with the Notice of Evil,
suppose it to be rightly understood, there was not
given a Power to avoid it; and therefore it could
not be alledged, that the Notice > was any way
kind, and that it was not likely to proceed from a
beneficent Spirit, but meerly Fortuitous and of
no Significancy.
3. He objected, That if such Notices as those
were of such Weight, why were they not Con-
stant: But that sometimes they were given, and
sometimes omitted, though Cafes were equally
important; and that therefore they did not seem
to proceed from any Agent, whose Actions "were to be fairly accounted for.
4. He said, That oftentimes, we had very di-
stinct and formal Dreams, without any Significa-
tion at all, that we could neither know any Thing
probable or any Thing rational of them; and that
it would be profane to suggest that to come from
Heaven, which was too apparently foolish and
inconsistent.
5. As Men were not always thus warned, or
supplied with Notices of Good or Evil, so ali
Men were not alike supplied with them; and
what Reason could we give, why one man or one
Woman should not have the same Hints as ano-
ther.
The Clergyman gave distinct Answers to all
these objections, and to me, I confess, very
satisfactory; whether they may be so to those that
read them, is no Concern of mine, let every one
judge for himself.
1. He said, that as to the Signification of
Dreams, and the objections against them, be-
cause dark and doubtful, that they are express'd
generally by Hieroglyphical Representations, Si-
milies, Allusions, 4 and figurative emblematick
Bb 3 Ways
Ways of expressing Things was true, and that
by this means, for want of Interpretation, the
Thing was not understood, and consequently the
Evil not fliun'd. This, he said, was the only
Difficulty that remained to him in the Cafe, but
that he could fee nothing in it against the Sig-
nification of them, because thus it was be -
fore 5 for Dreams were often aliegorick and acsive, when they were evidently from God; and
what the End and Design of Providence in that
was, we could not pretend to enquire.
2. To the Second he said, we charged Godfoo-
UJhly, to say he had given the Notice of Evil
without the powerto avoid ity which he denied J
and affirmed, that if any one had^not Power to
avoid the Evil, it was no Notice to him, that it
was want of giving due Heed to that 'notice, not for want of the Notice being sufficient that,
any Evil followed, and that Men first neglected
themselves, and then charged the Judge of all the
Earth with not doing right.
3. Likewise he said,the Complaint that these no rices were not constant, was unjust, for he doubt-
ed not but they were so5 but our discerning was
trazed and clouded by our negligence in not tak-
ing due Notice of it, that we hoodwinked our
Understanding by pretending Dreams were not to
be regarded; and the Voice really spoke^ but we
refused to hear being negligent of our own Good,
* 4. In the same Sense he answered the Fourth,
and said, it was a Mistake to fay, that sometimes
Dreams had no Import at all, he said it was only
to be said, none that we could perceive the Rea-
son of, which was owing to our Blindness and su-
pine Negligence to be secure at one time^ and
our Heads too much alarmed at another; so that
the Spirit which we might be said to be conver-
sing with in a Dream, was constantly and equal ly kind and careful, but our Powers, not always in
the fame State of action, nor equally attentive
to, or retention of the Hints that were given; or
Things might be rendred more or less intelligible
to us, as the Powers of our Soul were more or less
doz'd or fomniated with the Oppression of Va-
pours from the Body, which occasions Sleep; for
- tho' the Soul cannot be said to deep itself, yet
how far its Operations may be limited, and the
Understanding perfcribed by the Sleepiness of the
Body, says he, I will not undertake, let the Ana-
tomist judge of it, who can account for the Con-
texture of the Parts, and for their Operations, which I cannot answer to.
5. As to the last question, why People are not
equally supplied with such Warnings, he said, this
seemed to be no question at all in the Cafe; for
Providence itself might have some Share in the
Direction of it, and then that Providence might
perhaps be limited by some superiour Direction,
the same that guides all the solemn Dispositions of
Nature, and was a Wind blowing where it list-
cth: that as to the Converse of Spirits, tho' he
allowed the Thing itself, yet he did not tie it up
to a stated Course of Conversing, that it should be the same always, and to all People, and on all
occasions ; but that it seemed to be spontaneous,
and consequently Arbitrary, as if the Spirits
unembodicd had it left to them to converse as
they thought fit, how, where, and with whom
they would; that all he answered for in that Dis-
course was for the Thing itself, that such a Thing
there was, but why there was so much of it, ot
why no more, was none of his business, and he
believed a Discovery was not yet made to Man-
kind of that Part,
B b 4 I thought
I thought it would be much to the purpose to rpmark this Opinion of another Man, because it
corresponded so exactly witvh my own, but I have
not done with my Friend, for he led me into T' nother Enquiry, which indeed I had not taken} so much notice of before, and this was introdur
ced by the following question. You seem, says he, to be very inquisitive about
Dreams, and to doubt, thoy J think you have no
reasonfor it, of the Reality of the World of Spi-
rits, which Dreams are such an Evidence of. Pray,
says he, what think you of waking Dreams, Tran-
ses. Visions, Noises, Voices, Hints, Impulses,
and all these waking Testimonies of all invisibly
World, and ofthe Communication that there is
between us and them, which are generally obtained with our Eyes open.
This led me into many reflections upon past;
Things, which I had been witness to as well in
myself as in other Pepple, and particularly in my
former Solitudes, when I had many Occasions to
mark such Things as these; and I could not but
entertain a free Conversation with my Friend up-
on this subject, as often 'as I had Opportunity,
pf which I racist give some Account.
I had one Day been conversing so long with
him upon the common received Notions of the
Planets being habitable, and of a Diversity of
Worlds, that I think verily, I was for some Days
like a man transported into these regions myself >
whether my Imagination is more addicted to real-
izing the Things I talk of, as if they were in
View, I know not; or whether by the Power of
the Converse of Spirits I speak of, I was at that
Time enabled to entertain clearer Ideas of the
Invisible World, I really cannot tell > but I cer-
tainly made a Journey to all thpsi? supposed ha-
bitable,
bieable Bodies in my Imagination, and I know
not but it may be very useful to tell you what I
met with in my Way, and what the wiser I am for the Discovery; whether you will be the wiser
for the Relation at second Hand, I cannot answer for that.
I could make a long Discourse here of the Pow-
er of Imagination, and how bright the Ideas of
Distant Things may be found in the Mind, when
the Soul is more than ordinarily agitated: It is
certain the extraordinary Intelligence conveyed in
this Manner is not always regular, sometimes it is
exceeding confused, and the Brain being not able
to digest it, turns round too fast ; this tends to Lu-
nacy and Distraction, and the Swiftness of the Mo-
tion these Ideas come in with, occasions a Com-
motion in Nature, the understanding is mobbed
with them, disturbed, runs from one Thing to arfo-
thpr, and digests nothing ,• this is well expressed
in our common way of talking of a mad Man,
namely, that his Head is turned. Indeed I can
liken it to nothing so well as to the Wheels of a
Wind-mill, which if the Sails or Wings are set,
and the Wind blow a Storm, run round so fast, that
they will set all on Fire, it a skilful Hand be not
ready to direct and manage it.
EJutnotto enter upon this whymsical Description
of lunacy, which perhaps may be no Bodies Opi-
nion but my own, I proceed thus. That when the
Head is strong, and capable of the Impressions;
when the Understanding is impowered to digest
the infinite Variety of Ideas, which present to it
from the extended Fancy; then, I say,the Soul of
Man is capable to act strangely upon the Invisibles
in Nature, and upon Futurity, Reallizing every
Thing to itself in such a lively Manner, that what
it thus thinks, of, it really fees, speaks to, hears,
con-
converses with, &c as livelily, as if the Substance
was really before his face ; and this is what I
mean by those that dream waking, by visions, trances, or what you please to call them; for it is
not necessary to this Part, that the Man should be asleep.
I return to my Share of these Things* It was
after my conversing with my learned Friend a-
bout the heavenly Bodies, the Motion, the Di-
stances, and the Bulk of the Planets, their Si-
tuation, and the Orbits they move in, the
Share of Light, Heat and Moisture, which they
enjoy, their Respect to the Sun, their Influences
upon us, and at last, the possibility of their being
habitable, with all the Arcana of the skies; it
was on this occasion, I fay, that my Imagination,
always given to wander, took a Flight of its own;
and as I have told you that I had an invincible
Inclination to travel, so I think I travelled as sen-
sibly, to my understanding, over all the Mazes
and Wastes of infinite Space, in Quest of those
Things, as ever I did over the Desarts of Ka-
rakathayp and the uninhabited wafts of 'fartary,
and perhaps may give as useful an Account of
my Journey.
When first my Fancy rais'd me up in the Con-
fines of this vast Abyss, and having now tra-
velled thro? the misty Regions of the Atmo-
sphere could look down as I mounted, and fee the
World below me, tis scarce possible to ima-
gine, how little, how mean, how despicable every
Thing looked > let any Man but try this Experi-
ment of himself, and he shall certainly find the
same Thing; let him but fix his Thoughts so in tenfly upon what is, and must necessarily be seen
in a Stage or two higher, than,where we now
live removed from the particular Converse with
the
the World, as to reallize to his Imagination what
he can suppose to be there, he shall find all that
is below him, as distant objects always do,
lessen in his Mind as they do in his Sight.
Could a Man subsist without a supply of Food,
and live but one Mile in perpendicular Height from
the Surface, he would despise Life and the World
at such a Rate, that he would hardly come down
to have it be all his own; the Soul of Man is
capable of being continually elevated above the
very Thoughts of human Things, is capable of
gravelling up to the highest and most distant Re-
gions of Light, but when it does, as it rises a-
bove the earthly Globe, so the Things of this
Globe sink to him.
When I was at first lifted up in my imaginary
Travels, this was the first Thing of Moment I
remarked; namely, how little the World and every
Thing about it seemed to me: I am not given to
preach or drawing long Corollaries as the Learned
call them, but I commend it to my Friends to ob-
serve, that could we always look upon the Things
'of Life with the fame Eyes, as we (hall do when
we come to the Edge of Time, when one Eye can
as it were look back on the, World, and the other
look forward into eternity, we should save our-
selves the Trouble of much Repentance, and
should scorn to touch many of those Things, in
which how we fancy our chief Felicity is laid up;
believe me we shall fee more with half an Eye
then, and judge better at first Glance, than we
can now with all our pretended Wisdom and Pe-
netration. In a Word, all the Passions and Af-
fections suffer a general Change upon such a View,
and what we desire before, we contemn then with
Abhorrence,, * *
l Having
Hating begun to soar, the World was soon out
of sight, unless that as I rose higher, and could
look at her in a due Position as to the Sun, I could
fee her turned into a Moon, and shine by Refle-
ction: Sunshineasaid I, with thy borrowed Rays,
for thou hast but very few of thy own.
When ray Fancy had mounted me thus beyond
the Vestiges of the Earth, and leaving the Atmos-
phere behind me, I had set my firm Foot upon the
Verge of Infinite, when I drew no Breath,
but subsisted upon pure Æther> it is not possible
to express fully the Vision of the Place,* first you
are to conceive of Sight as unconfin'd, and you
fee here at least the whole solar system at one View.
Nor is your Sight bounded by the narrow Cir-
cumference of one Sun, and its Attendants of Pla-
nets, whose Orbits are appropriated to its proper
System, but above and beyond, and on every Side
you see innumerable Suns, and attending on them,
Planets, Satellites^ and inferior Lights proper
to their respective Systems, and all these mov-
ing in their subordinate s, without the
least Confusion, with glorious Light and Splendor
inconceivable.
In this first Discovery 'tis most natural to ob-
serve, how plainly it is to be seen, that the Reason
of the Creation of such immense Bodies as the Sun,
Stars, Planets, and Moons in the great Circle of
the lower Heaven, is far from being to be found in
the Study of Nature, on the Surface of our Earth:
but he that wjllsce thorowly, why God.has formd
the Heavens the Work of his Hands, and the
Moon and the Stars which he has made, must soar
up higher; and then as he will fee with other Eyes
than he did before, so he will fee the God of Na-
ture has form'd an infinite variety which we know
nothing
nothing of, and that all the Creatures are a Rea*
son to one another for their Creation.
I could not forget myself however, when I was
got up thus high, I fay, I could not but look back
upon the State of Man in this Life, how confined
from these discoveries, how vilely employed in
biting and devouring, envying, and maligning one
another, and all for the vilest Trifles that can be
conceived.
Buri was above it all here, and all those Things
which appeared so afflicting before, gave me not
the least Concern now; for the Soul being gone of
this Errand, had quite different Notices of the
whole State of Life, and was neither influenced
by Paflions or affections as it was before.
Here I saw into many Things by the Help of a
sedate Inquiry, that we can entertain little or no
Notion of in a State of commmon superficial
Life, and I desire to leave a few Remarks of this
imaginary Journey, as I did of my ordinary Tra-
vels.
When I came, I fay, to look into the solar
System as I have hinted, I saw perfectly the Emp-
tiness of our modern Notions, that the Planets
were habitable Worlds, and shall give a brief
Description of the Case, that others may fee it
too, without the necessity of taking so long a
Journey.
And first for the Word habitable, I understand
the- meaning of it to be, that the Place it is spo-
ken of, is,qualify'd for the Subsistence and Exi-
stence of Man and Beast3 and to preserve the vege-
tative and sensitive Life; and you may depend up-
on it, that none of the Planets except the Moon,
are in this Sense habitable; and the Moon, a poor
little watery damp Thing, not above as big as
Torkfiire, neither worth being called a World, nor
capable
[JO]
capable of rendring Life comfortable to Mankind,
if indeed supportable; and if you will believe
one's Mind capable of seeing at so great a Di-
stance, I assure you I did not see Man, Woman or
Child there in all my Contemplative Voyage to
it; my meaning is, I did not fee the least Rea-
son to believe there was or,could be any there. As
to the rest of the Planets, Til take them in their
Order. Saturn, (the remotest from the Sun, which
is in the Centre of the System J is a vast extended
Globe, of a Substance cold and moist, its greatest j|
"Degree of Light is never so much as our greatest
Darkness may be said to be in clear Weather, and
its cold unsuffera5ble; and if it were a Body com-
posed of the same Elements as our Earth, its Sea
would be all Brafs3 and its Earth all Iron; that
is to fay, both would be continually frozen, as
the North-Pole in the Winter Solstice. What Man
or Men, and of what Nature, could inhabit this
frigid Planet, unless the Creator must be sup-
posed to have created animal Creatures for the
Climate, not the Climate for the Creatures. All
the Notions of §aturns being a habitable World,
are contrary to Nature,and incongruous with Sense;
for Saturn is at so ihfinite a distance from the
Sun, that it has not above one ninetieth Part of
the Light and Heat that we enjoy on our Earth \
so that the Light there, may be said to be much
less than our Star-light, and the cold ninety Times
greater than the coldest Day in our Winter*
Jupiter is in the fame Predicament his Consti-
tution, however in its Degree much milder than
Saturn, yet certainly is not qualify'd for human
Bodies to subsist, having only one twenty-seventh
Part of the Light and Heat that we enjoy here*
consequently its Light is at best as dim as our
Twilight, and its Heat so little in the Summer of
its Situation, as to be as far from comfortable, as
it is in its Winter Situation insupportable.
Mars, If you will believe our ancient Philoso-
phers, is a fiery Planet in the very Disposition of
its Influence, as well as by the course of its Mo-
tion; and yet even here, the Light is not above
one Half, and its Heat One Third of ours. And
on the other Hand, as Saturn is cold and moist,
so this Planet is hot and dry, and would admit
no Habitation of Man, through the manifests In-
temperance of the Air, as well as want of light to make it comfortable and moisture to make it
fruitful; for by the Nature of the Planet, as well
as by clear-sighted Observation, there is never
any Rain* Vapour, Fog, or Dew in that Pla-
net.
Venus and Mercury are in the extreme the other
Way, and would destroy Nature by their Heat
and dazling Light, as the other would by their
Darkness and Cold, so that you may depend up-
on it, I could fee very clearly, that all these Bo-
dies were neither inhabited or habitable; and the
Earth only as we call it, being seated between these
Intemperances appeared habitable, surrounded
with an Atmosphere to defend it, from the Inva-
sion of the inconsistent Æther, in which Perspiration
could not be performed by the lungs, and by
which the needful Vapour it fends forth, is pre-
served from dissipating into the Waste and Abyss,
and is condensed and timely returns in Showers of
Rain to moisten* cool, and nourish the exhausted
Earth.
It is true the Way I went was no common
Road, yet I found Abundance of passengers go-
ing to and fro here, and particularly innumerable
Armies of good and evil Spirits, who all feemM
busily employed, and continually upon the Wing, as
if
if sortie Expresses pass'd between the EMH, which
"in this Part of my Travels I place below me, and
some Country infinitely beyond all that I could
reach the Sight of > for by the Way, though I
take upon me in this sublime Journey to see a
great deal of the invisible World, yet I was not
arrived to a Length to fee into any Part of the
World of Light, beyond it all; that Vision is
beyond all, and I pretend tp fay nothing of it
here, except this only, that7a clear View of this
Part with Opticks unclouded is a great Step to
prepare the Mind for a Look into the other.
But to return to my Station in the highest crea*
ted World, flatter not yourselves that4 those Re-
gions are uninhabited, because the Planets ap-
pear to be so. No, no, I assure you this is that
vWorld of Spirits, or at least is a World of Spirits;
Here I saw a clear Demonstration of Satan be-
ing the Prince of the Power of the Air; 'tis in this
boundless Waste he is confined, whether it be his
bufie restless Inclination has posted him here, that
he may affront God in his Government of the
World, and do injury to Mankind in meer Envy
to his Happiness, as the famed Mr. Milton fays it, or whether it is that by the eternal Decree of Pro-
vidence he is appointed to be Mans continual
Disturber for divine Ends, to us unknown; this
I had not wandered far enough to be informed of,
those Secrets being lodged much higher, than I-
magination itself ever travelled.
But here, I say, I found Sathan keeping his
Court, or Camp we may call it, which we please*
The innumerable Legions that attended his im-
mediate Service were such, that it is not at all to
be wondred that he supplied every Angle of this
World, and had his Work going forward, not in
every Country only, but even in every individual
Inhabitant of it, with all the dexterity and Appli-
cation imaginable.
This sight gave me a just Idea of the Devil
as a tempter, but really let me into a Secret,
which I did not so well know before, or at least
did not consider; namely, that the Devil is not
capable of doing half the Mischief in the World
that we lay to his Charge; that he works by En-
gines and Agents, Stratagems and Art is true, and
a great deal is owing to his Vigilance and Ap-
plication ; for he is a very diligent Fellow in his
Calling: But 'tis plain, his Power is not so great
as we imagine, he can only prompt to the Crime,
he cannot force us to commit it,* so that if we sin
9tis all our own, the Devil is only to be charged
with the Art of Insinuation just as he began with
Eve j he goes^on with us ,* in short he reasons us
out of our Resolutions to do well, and wheedles us
to an Agreement "todo working us up to an
Opinion3 that what Evil we are about to do is no
Sin, or not so great a Sin as we feared, and so
draws us by Art into the Crime we had resolved
against ; this indeed the Scripture intimates when
it speaks of Satan's Devices, the Subtilty of the
wicked one, his lying in wait, &c. But to charge
the Devil with forcing us to offend, is doing the
Devil a great Deal of Wrong: Our doing Evil is
from the native propensity of our Wills: Humor
num est peccare. I will not enter here into the Dis-
pute about anorig nalCorruption in Nature,which
I know many good Men and learned Men dispute,
but that there is a secret Aptness to offend, and a
secret Backwardness to what is Good, which if
it is not born with us, we can give no Account how
we came by, this I think every Man will grant;
and that this is the Devil that tempts us, the Scrip-
ture plainly tells us, when it fays, Every Man is
C c temped
"temptedwhen hefys drawn away of his own loftand
enticed.
There is a secret Love of Folly and vanity in
the Mind, and Mankind are hurry'd down the
Stream of their,own affections into Crime, 'tis
agreeable to them to do this, and \i$ a Force up-
on Nature not to do it.
Vice is down Hilly and when we do offend,KTis Nature ally we a&atwe intend.
Venue s up Hilly and all against the Grain
Resolvd reluctant, andpursued with Pain.
But to return to the Devilhis Power not
extending to Creation, and being not able to force
the World into an open rebellion against Heaven,
as doubtless he would do if he could, he is left to
the Exercise ofhis Skill; and in a Word we may
fay of him, that he lives by his wits\ that is to fay,
maintains his Kingdom by Subtilty and most ex-
quisite-Cunning j and if my Vision of his Poli-
ticks is not a new discovery, I am very much
mistaken.
His innumerable Legions as I hinted above, like
Aid du Camps to a General, are continually em-
ployed to carry his Orders, and execute his Com-
missions in all Parts of the World, and in every in-
dividual to oppose the Authority of God, and the
Felicity of Man to the utmost of his Power.
- The first and greatest part of his Government,
is over thofe Savage Nations where he has obtain-
ed to set himself up 4$ God, and to be worshipped
instead of God; and I observed, that though ha-
ving full Possession ofthese People, even by whole
nations at a time,- that is the easiest Part of his t ; *: Govern-
Government, yet he is far from neglecting his Inte-
rest there, but is exceeding vigilant to keep up his
Authority among those People* This he does
by sending Messengers into those Parts to answer
the Pawawings or Conjurings, even of the most
ignorant old Wizard, raising Storms and making
Noises and Shreiks in the Air, Flashes of infernal
Fire, and any Thing but to fright the People, that they may nor forget him, and that they may
have no other Gods but him.
He has his peculiar Agents for this Work,' which he makes Detachments of, as his Occasions,
require, some to one part of the World, some to
another, as to the North America,even as far as
to the frozen Provinces of Groenland; to the North
of Europe, to the Laplanders, Samotedes, and Mm-
gul-tfartars, also to the Gog and Magog of Asiai
and to the Devil-makers of China and Japan,
again to the Southern Parts of Asia, to the Isles
of the Indian and South Seas, and to the South
Part of America and Africa.
"Through all these Parts he has an uncontrolled
Power, and is either worshipped in Person, or by
his Representatives, the Idols and Monsters which
the poor People bow down to, and Satan has very
little Trouble with them;
He employs indeed some Millions of his Missio-
naries into those Countries, who labour ad propa*
gand.fid. and fail not to return and bring him an
account of their Success, and I doubt not but
some of them were at Hand in my Island, wheri
the Savages appeared there; for it the Devil had
not been in them, they would hardly have come
straggling over the Sea so far^ to devour one
another;
C € 2
la
In all these Countries the Brutality, the Cruelty
and ravenous bloody Dispositions of the People, is
to me a certain Testimony that the Devil has full
Possession of them.
But to return to my Observations in the exalted
State of my Fancy, I must tell you5 that though
the Devil carried on his Schemes of Government, in those blinded Parts of the World with great
Ease, and all Things went to his Mind; I found
* he had more Difficulty in the northern Parts of
the temperate Zone, I mean, our climate and
the rest of Christendom, and consequently he did
not act here by whole Squadrons and by Generals;
but was obliged to carry on his business among us
by particular Solicirations, to act by particular
Agents upon particular Persons, attacking the
personal conduct of Men in a Manner peculiar to
himself: But so far was this difficulty from being
any advantage to the World, or Disadvantage to
the Devil, that it only obliged him to make Use
of the more Engines; pd as he had no want of
Numbers, I observed that his whole Clan seemed
busy on this Side5 the Number of which consists
of innumerable M llions j so that in short, there
was not a Devil wanting, no, not to manage eve-
ry individual Man, Woman, and Child in the
World.
How and in what Manner evil Angels attend us,
what their business, how far their Power extends,
and how far it is restrained, and by who, were all
made plain to me ac one View in this Stare of
Eclartafftment that I stood in now, and I will de-
scribe it if I can in a few Heads of fact i you may
enlarge upon them as Experience guides * , m And
And first, the Limitations of the Devil's Power,
are necessary to be understood, and how directed;
torExample, you must know, that though the
Numbers of these Evil Spirits, which are thus
diligently employed in Mischief, are so infinitely
great, yet the Numbers of good Angels or good
Spirits, which are employed by a superior Au-
thority, and from a Place infinitely distant and
high above the Devils bounds, is not only equal;
I fay, equal at least in Number, but infinitely su-
perior in Power, and it is this Particular which
makes it plain, that all the Devil does, or that his
Agents can do, is by continual Subtilty, extreme
vigilance and Application, under infinite Checks,
Rebukes, and Callings off by the attendant Spi-
rits, who have Power to correct and restrain him
upon all occasions ; just as a Man does a Dog or
a, Thief when he is discovered.
On this Account, *tis first plain, I fay, that the
Devil-can do nothing by Force, he cannot kill,
maim, hurt or destroy; if he could, Mankind
would have but a very precarious State of Life in
the World: Nay, the Devil cannot blast the Fruits
of the Earth, cause Dearth, Droughts, famines^ or Scarcity, neither can he spread noxious fumes in the Air to infect the World; if any of those
Things were in his Power, he would soon unpeo-
ple God's Creation, and put his Maker to the
Necessity of a new Fiat, or of having no more
human Creatures to worship and honour him.
You will ask me, how I came to know all this?
fay, ask me no questions, till the Elevation
of your Fancy carries you up to the outer Edge of
the Atmosphere, as I tell you mine did: There
you will fee the Prince of the Air in his full State,
managing hmmiversal Empire with the most exqui-
site Art: But if ever you can come to a clear View
C c 3 of
of his Person, do but look narrowly, and you'll
fee a great Clog fit his Foot, in token of his
mited Power, and though he is himself immense in
bulk, and moves like a fiery meteor in the Air,
yet you always fee a hand with a Thunderbolt
impending just over his Head; the arm coming
out of a fiery Cloud, which is a Token of the Sen-
tence he is under, that at th<? End of his appointed
Time that Cloud shall break, and that Hand strike
him with the Thunder represented, Down, Down
for ever, into a Place prepared for hm.
But $11 this does not hinder him, who is
prompted by infernal Rage against the Kingdom
of God, and the Welfare of Man, from pushing
Mankind as above, upon all the Methods of their
own Ruin and Destruction, by alluring Baits, cun-
ning Artifice, Night-whispers, infusing wicked De-
sires, and fanning the Flames of }Æcns Lusts*
Pride, Avarice, Ambition, Revenge, and all the
wicked ^Excursions of corrupt Nature.
It would take up a con tract by itself, to form
£ System of the Devil's Politicks, and to lay down
9, Body of his Philosophy: I observed how-
ever, that some of his general Rules are such a$
these,
i. To infuse Notions of Liberty into the
Minds p( Men; that it is hard they should bq
born into the World with Inclinations,and then be
forbidden to gratify them that such and such
Pleasures should be prepaid in the Nature of
TWtags, made suitable and proper to the Senses
^nd Faculties, which on the other Hand, are pros pared in mere Constitution, and placed in his
Soul, and that then he should be forbidden under
the Penalty of a Curse to taste them ; that t<f place
in Appetite in the Man, and a strong powerful
Guft tq thesi? delights, and then declare them fa-
h\ to him, would be laying a Snare to Man-
kind in his very Constitution, and making his
brightest Faculties be the Betrayers of his Soul to
Misery, which would not consist with justice, much less with the Goodness of a Creator.
2. To persuade from hence, that the Notions
of future Punishments are Fables and Amuse-
ments, that it is not rational to think a just God
would prepare infinite and eternal ^Punishments,
for finite and trivial Offences; that God does' not
take Notice of the minute acts of Life, and lay
every Slip to our Charge, but that the merciful
Dispositions of God, who'so 'bountiful]/ directs
the whole World to be assistant tp the Profit and
Delight of Mankind, has certainly given him
leave to enjoy it (at fill, and take the Comfort of
it without fear.
3. Of late indeed the devil has learn'd, for Devils may improve as wellas Men in the artsof doing
ill. At last, I fay, he has learned to infuse a wild
Notion into the Heads of some People, who are
first fitted for it, by having reasoned themselves in
Favour of their loose Desires up tp a Pitch, that
there is no such Thing as a God or a future State
at all.
Now as at first the Devil was not Fool enough
to attempt to put this Jest upon Man, his own
Antiquity and Eternity being a Contradiction to it ;
so I found among my new Discoveries,that the Devil
took this Absurdity from Man himself, and that it
went among Satan's People for a new invention : I
found also that there was a black Party employed
upon this new Subtilty, these were a Sort of De-
vils, for Satan never wants Instruments, who were called Injinuatorsi and who were formerly employed
to prompt Men to Crimes by Dreams ; and here I
Gallobserve, that I learned a Way how to make
Any Man dream of what I please: For Example,
suppose one to be sound asleep, or as we fay, in a
deep Sleep, or dead asleep, let another lay his
Mouth close to his Ear, and whisper any Thing
to him so softly as not to awaken him, the sleep-
ing Man shall certainly dream of what was so
whispered to him.
Let no Man despise this Hint, nothing is more
sure, than that many of our Dreams are the Wis-
pers of the Devil, who by his lnsmuators whispers
into our Heads, what wicked Things he wou'd
have our Thoughts entertain and work upon; and
take this with you as you go, those insinuating
Devils can do this as well when we are awake, as
when we are asleep, and this will bring me to
what I call impulsesupon the Mind,which are cer-
tainly whispers in the Ear and no other, and come
either from good Angels attending us, or from the
Devil's Injinuators, which are always at hand, and
may be judged of according as the subject our
thoughts are prompted to work upon, are Good or Evil
From whence but from these Insinuators, come
our causeless Passions, our involuntary Wickedness,
sinning in Desire as effectually, as by actual com-
mitting the Crime we desire to commit?
Whence comes imagination to work upon
wicked and vicious objects, when the Person is
fast asleep, and when he had not been under the
Preparation of wicked Discourse, or wicked
thoughts previous to those Imaginations? who
forms Ideas in the Mind of Man? who presents
beautiful or terrible Figures to his Fancy, when
his Eyes are closed with Sleep? who, but these in-
sinuating Devils, who invisibly approach the
Man sleeping or waking, and whisper all man-
ner of lewd abominable things into his Mind.
Mr. Mfc
Ha Milton, whose Imagination was carried up
to a greater He ght than I jam now, went farther
into the Abyss of Satan's Empire a great Way,
especially when he form'd Satan's Palace of Pande-
monium, I say, he was exactly of this Opfnionjwhen
he represented the Devil tempting our Mother Eve,
in the Shape of a Toad lying just at her Ear, when
she lay fast asleep in her Bower, where he whispered to her Ear all the wicked Things which she en-
tertained Notions of by Night, and which
prompted her the next Day to break the great Com-
mand, which was the rule of her [Life; and ac cordingly he brings in Eve telling Adam what an
yneasy Nights Rest she had, and relating herDream to him.
This Thought, however laid down in a kind of
jest, is very seriously intended, and would, if well
digested, direct us very clearly in our Judgment of
Dreams; viz,, not to suggest them to be always
things of meer Chance; but that sometimes they
are to be heeded as useful Warnings of Evil of
Good by the Agency of good Spirits, as at other
Times they are the artful Insinuations of the De-
vil to inject wicked Thoughts and abhorr'd abo-
minable ideas into the Mind; which we ought not
only as much/as possible to guard against, but even
to repent of, so far as the Mind may have enter-
tained and acted upon them.
From this general Vision of the Devil's Ma-
nagement of his Affairs, which I must own I have
had with my Eyes wide open, I find a great many
useful Observations to be made; and first, it can
be no longer strange, that while the Commerce of
Evil Spirits is so free, and the intercourse between
this world and that, is thus open, I fay, it can be
no longer strange, that 'there are so many silent
W ays
Ways of Spirits conversing, I mean spirits of
all Kinds*
For as I have observed already; there is a Resi-
dence of good spirits, but they are placed infinite-
ly higher out of the Reach, and out of the Sight of
this lower Orbit of Satan's Kingdom \ as
those pass and repass invisible, I confess, I have
yet*had no Ideas of them, but those which I have
received from my first view of the infernal Re-
gion: If I should have any superior Elevations,
and should be able to fee the OEconomy of Heaven
in his Disposition of Things on Earth, I shall be
as careful to convey them to Posterity as they
come in. >
However, the Transactions of good Spirits with Man are certainly the fame,- for as God has*for
a Protection and Safeguard to Mankind, limited
the Devil from affrighting him, by visible Appear-
ances in his native and hellish Deformity, and the
horrrid Shape he would necessarily bear: So* for
Man's Felicity, even the glorious Angels of Hea-
ven are very seldom allowed, at least not lately,
to appear in the glorious Forms they formerly
took, or indeed in any Form, or with a Voice;
the restraint of our Souls in the Cafe of Flesh and
Blood we now wear not admitting it, and not
being able to familiarize those Things to us; Man
being by no Means, in his encorporated State,qua-
lifted for an open and easy Conversation with urr
embodied spirit Moreover, this would be breaking into the
Limits, which the Wisdom and Goodness of God
has put to our present State, I mean as to Futurity;
our Ignorance in which, is the greatest Felicity of
human Life; and without which necessary Blind-
ness Man could not support Life, for Nature is no
way able to support a View into Futurity; I mean
not into that Part of futurity which concerns us in
our State of Life in this World.
I have often been myself among the Number of
those Fools, that would be their own Fortune-tel-
lers; but when I look thus beyond the Atmosphere,
and see a little speculatively into Invisibles, I could
easily perceive, that it is our Happiness that we
are fliort-sighted Creatures, and can fee but a very
little before us: For Example, were we to have the
Eyes of our Souls opened through the Eyes of our
Bodies, we should fee this very immediate Region
of Air which we breath in, throng'd with Spirits,
to us, blessed be God, now invisible, and which would7
otherwise be most frightful: We should see into
the secret Transactions of those Messengers who
#re employed when the passing Soul takes its Leave
of the Reluctant Body, and perhaps fee Things Na-
ture would shrink back from with the utmost Ter-
ror and Amazement.In a Word,the curtain of Pro-
vidence for the Disposition of Things here, and
the Curtain of Judgment for the Determination of
the State of Souls hereafter, would be alike
drawn back, and what Heart could support here
its future State in LI FE, much less that of itst
future State after LI FE even good or bad.
It is then our Felicity, that the Converse of Spi-
rits, and the Visions of futurity, are silent, em-
blematick, and done by Hints, Dreams, and Im-
pulses, and not by clear Vision and open Discovery;
they that desire a fuller and plainer Sight of these'
Things, ask they know not what; and it was a
good answer of a Gypsy, when a Lady of my Ac-
quaintance, ask'd her, to tell her Fortune; Do not
ask me, Lady, said the Gypsy, to tell you what you
dare not hear. The Woman was a little honester than
her Profession intimated, and freely confessed it was
all a Cheated that they knew nothing of Fortunes,
but but had a Course or Round of doubtful expressions, to amuse ignorant People and get a little Money.
Even the Devils Oracles, for such no doubt
they were at Detyhosy and at other Places, though
the Devil seemed at that Time to have some Li-
berties granted him, which it is evident have since
been denied him, were allowed to be given only
in doubtful Expressions, doub!e Entendres, Ecchoes
of Word?, and fucklike: For Exams If, A Man
going to Sea and enquiring of the Oracle, thus;
Haveljust cause the Seas and Storms to Fear?
jEccho. m Fear*
Another.
Sh$ wf the Parthian Bowmen fightor Fly?
Eccho. « Fly.Such dark Replies, and other Words doubtful
and enigmatic, were frequently given an4 tak£n for Answers, by which the deluded World were kept in
doubt of that Futurity they hunted after: But Satan
even then, was not permitted tp speak plain, pr
Mankind to see what awaited him behind the dark
Veil of futurity, nor was it proper on any Ac-
count whatsoever, that it should be otherwise.
But before I come to this, let me put some Li-
mits to the Elevations and Visions I have men-
tioned before; for as I am far from Enthusiastic
in my Notions of Things, so I would not lead any
one to fancy themselves farther enlightned than is
meet, or to fee Things unseeable, as St. Paul heard
things unutterable.
And therefore let me add here, that the highest
Raptures, Trances and Elevations of the Soul, are
bounded by the eternal Dectee of Heaven and let
Men
Men pretend to what visions they please, it is all
Romance, all beyond what I have talked of a-
bove, is fabulous and abiurd, and it will for ever
be true, as the Scripture fays, not only, those
'things are hi from the eye,but even from the
Conception.
Upon this Occasion I must own, that I think
'tis Criminal to attempt to form Ideas either of
Hell or of Heaven in the Mind, other than as the
Scripture has described them, by the State rather
than the Place; we are told in plain Words, it
hath not enteredinto the Heart of Man to conceive, ei-
ther of what is prepared for the future State of the
Happy or miserable ; 'tis enough for us to enter-
tain the general Notion, the Favour of God is
Heaven, and the Loss of it the most dreadful of
all Hell.
A Heaven'sJoy must in his Presence dwell;Ani in his Abjeme every Place is Hell.
My Meaning is this, all Visions, or propoun-
ded Visions either of Heaven or Hell, are meer
Delusions of the Mind, and generally are fictions of a waking bewildred Head ; and you may fee
the Folly of them in the meannest of the Descrip-
tions, which generally end in {hewing some glo-
rious Place, fine Walks, noble illustrious Palaces,
Gardens of Gold, and People of shining Forms,
and the like. Alas! these are all so short, that
they are unworthy the Thoughts of a Mind
elevated two degrees above Darkness and Dirt:
\ All these Things amount to no more than Mar
hornet's Alchoran, and the glorious State of Things
represented by him to his believers. In short,
all this makes only a Heaven of Sense, but comes
so infinitely short of what alone must or can be
a Hea.
lC 4^ ]
& Heaven to an exalted glorified Spirit, that I
as much want 'Words to express how contem-
tible the best of these Descriptions are as toa
true Description of Heaven, as I do to express a
true Idea, or Description of Heaven myself.
And how should this be done? We can Form
no Idea of any Thing that we know not and have
not seen, but in the Form of something that we
have seen. How then can we form an Idea of
God or Heaven, in any Form but of some-
thing which we have seen or known? By what
Image in the Mind can we judge of Spirits? By
what Idea conceive of eternal Glory? Let us
cease to Imagin concerning it, 'tis impossible to
attain, *tis criminal to attempt it.
Let me therefore hint here, that supposing my
self, as before, in the Orbit of the Sun, take it
in its immense Distance as our Astronomers con-
ceive of it, or on the Edge only of the Atmos-
phere with a clear View of the whole Solar Sy-
stem, the Region of Satan's Empire all in View, and the World of Spirits laid open to me.
Yet let me give you this for a Check to your
Imagination, that even here the Space between
Finite and Infinite is as impenetrable as on Earth,
and will for ever be so, till our Spirits being un-
cased shall take their Flight to the Center of
Glory, where every Thing shall be seen as it is;
and therefore you must not be surprized, if I am
tcftne down again from the Verge of the World
1 of Spirits, the fame shortsighted Wretch, as to Fu-
turity and Things belonging to Heaven and Hell
3,s I went up 3 for Elevations of this Kind are
meant only to give us a clearer View of what we
arenot of "What we stall be\ and *tis an Advan-
tage worth Travelling for too. All this I thought
* accessary to prevent the whimsical Building of
erroneous Structures on my Foundation, and fan-
cying themselves carried farther than they are
able to go. I come therefore back to talk of Things fa-
miliar, and particularly to mention in the next
Place, some of those other Ways by which we
have Notice given of this Converse of Spirits
which I have been speaking of; for the Whis-
pers and Insinuators I have mentioned, go some-
times farther than ordinary.
One of those other Methods is, when by
strong impulsesof the Mind, as we call them, we
arc directed to do, or not to do, this or that
particular Thing that we have before us to do, or,
are under Consultation about. I am a Witness
to many of these Things, as well in my own Life,
as in my observation of others.
I know a Man, who being at some distance from London, not above six or seven Miles, a
Friend that came to visit and dine with him urged
him to go to London. What for, fays his Friend *
is there any Business wants me? Nay, nothing, fays the other, but for your Company * I do not
know of any Thing wants you; and so gave ovet'
importuning him: But as his Friend had given
it over, a strong impulse of Mind seized him and
followed him like a Voice with this, Go to London,
go to London. He put it by several Times, but it
went on still, Go to London, go to London, and
nothing else could come upon his Thoughts but*
Go to London. He came back to his Friend,
Hark ye, fays he, tell me sincerely, is all well
at London? Am I wanted there? Did you ask me
to go to London with you on any particular Ac-
count. Not I, fays his Friend, in the least; I
saw all your family, and all is very well there;
bck did they fay, they had any particular Occa*-
( siOD?
Itf ]
sion for you to return; I only ask it as I told
you, for the Sake of Your Company: So he put
off going again, but could have no quiet, for it
still followed him, and no doubt, a good Spirit
communicated it, Go to London; and at length
he resolved he would go, and did so; and when he came there he found a Letter and Messengers
had been at his House, to seek him, and to tell
him of a particular business, which was first and
last worth above a thousand Pounds to him, and
which if he had not been found that very Night,
would have been in Danger of being lost.
I seriously advise all sober thinking Persons not
to disregard those powerful impulses of the Mind,
in Things otherwise indifferent or doubtful, but
believe them to be Whispers from some kind Spi-
rit, which fees something that we cannot fee,
and knows something that we cannot know.
Besides, unless infinite Power should take off
the Silence that is imposed upon the Inhabitants
of the invisible World, and allow them to speak
audibly, nothing can be a plainer Voice; they
are Words spoken to the Mind, tho' not to the
Ear, and they are a certain Intelligence of Things
unseen, because they are given by Persons un-
seen, and the Event confirms it beyond all Di-
spute,
I know a Man, who made it his Rule always
to obey these silent Hints, and he has ofteu de-
clared to me, that when he obeyed them he ne-
ver miscarried, and if he neglected them, or went
on contrary to them, he never succeeded; and
gave me a particular cafe of his own, among
a great many others, wherein he was thus direct-
ed. He had a particular Cafe befallen him,
wherein he was under the Displeasure of the.Go-
ternment^ and was prosecuted for a Misdemea-
nor,
i
nor, and brought to a Tryal in the KingVBench
Court, where a verdict was brought against him,
and he was cast; and Times running very hard
at that Time against the Party he was of, he
was afraid. to stand the Hazard of a Sentence
and absconded, taking Care to make due Provi-
sion for his Bail, and to pay, them whatever they
might suffer. In this Circumstance he was in
great Distress, and no Way presented unto him
. but to fly out of the Kingdom, which being to
leave his Family, Children and Employment, was
very bitter to him, and he knew not what to
do; all his Friends advising him not to put him-
self into the Hands of the Law, which ..tho' the
Offence was not Capital, yet in his Circum-
stances seemed to threaten his utter Ruin* In.
this Extremity he felt one Morning, (just as he
had awaked, and the Thoughts of his Misfor-
tune began to return upon him; ) I fay, he felt a
strong impulse darting into his Mind tfjks, Write
a Letter to them: It spoke so distinctly to him,
and as it were forcibly, that as he has often said
since, he can scarce persuade himself ^not to be-
lieve but that he heard it; but he grants that he
did not really hear it, too.
However it repeated the Words daily and
hourly to him, till at length walking about in
his Chamber where he was hidden, very pen-
sive and fad, it Jogg'd him again, and he an-
swered 'aloud to it, as if it had been a Voice,
Who Ball1 "write to? It returned immediately,
Write to the Judge. This persued him again for
several Days, till at length he took his Pen, Ink
and Paper, and fat down to write, but knew not
one Word of what he should fay, but Dabitur in hac
hora, he wanted not Words: It was immediately im-
pressed on his Mind, and the Words flowed up-
D d on
T his Pen in a manner, that even charm'd him self, and filled him with Expectations of Success.
The Letter was so strenous in Argument, so
pathetick in its eloquence, and re moving and
perswaftve, that as soon as the Judge read ity
he sent him Word he should be easier, for he
would Endeavour to make that Matter light to
him, and in a Word never left, till he obtained
to stop Prosecution* and restore him to his, Li-
berty and to his Family.
These Hints, I fay, are of a Nature too signi-
ficant to be neglected; whence they come is the
next Enquiry, I answer, They are the whispers of some subsisting, Spirit communicated to the
Soul, without the Help of the Organ, without
the Assistance of a particular Sound, and with-
out any other Communication ; but take it as you
go, not without the merciful Disposition of that
Power, that governs that World, as well as this
that we are sensible of; How near those Spirits
are to us, who thus foresee what concerns us,
and how they convey these Hints into our Minds
as well waking as steeping, or how they are di-
rected, that I could not discover, nor, can yet re*
solve, no not in the highest of my imaginary Ele-
vation, any more than in what Manner they are
Limited and restrained.
I have been asked by some, to whom I have
talked freely of my frequent Applications to
these Things, If I knew any Thing by those
Observations, of the Manner of the Disposition of
human Soul after its Departure out of the Body >
I mean as to its middle State, and whether, as some, it has a wandring Existence in the upper
Part of the Waste or Abyss near to, but not in
a present State of Felicity? Whether it is still
confined .within the Atmosphere of the Earth
N" ac-*
according to others, as in a Limhm, or Purga-
tory; or in the Circle of the Sun, as others fay?
Whether I knew or perceived any Thing of our
Saviour's being ascended into the Body of the
Sun only, and not into the highest Heaven re-
ceiving his redeemed souls to himself, and in-
to an Incorporation with his Glory there, till the
Restitution of all things? Whether I perceived any
Thing of Satan being possessed of the reprobate
Souls as they departed ,* and of his Substitutes
as Executioners, being empowered and employ-
ed to torment them according to the receiv-
ed Notions of the wife Contemplators of such
Things.
I answered, as I do now, that not only no-
thing of all this appears, but on the contrary, such
serious Contemplations as mine give a great and a bundant Reason to be satisfied, that there is no-
thing in it all but meer Dream and enthusiastick
Conjecture: I own that the Agents I mention-
ed, make use of all those Things to terrify and
affright poor ignorant People out of their senses, and to drive them often into Desperation, and
after to restore them by a Cure that is worse
than the Distemper, namely, by a Hardness and
Coldness of Temper, rejecting entirely all the No-
tions of Eternity and Futurity, and so fitting them
to go out of the World as they lived in it, (viz,.}
without troubling themselves with what is to
come after it. x
But I return to the Article of Impulses of the
Mind, for I lay greater Weight upon these than
upon any of the other Discoveries of the In-
visible World, because they have something in
them relating to what we are about, some-
thing dire6rmg, something to guide us" in avoid-
ing the evils that attend us, ^nd to accepting, or
D d a ra-
rather embracing Opportunities of doing theselves good when they present, which many
Times for want of the knowledge of our Way,
we irrecoverably let slip.!
Voices, Apparitions, Noises, and all the ox
ther affrighting things, which unavoidably fol-
low the Neighbourhood of Spirits in the air we breath in, seem to have much less Significa-
tion, as tom> than these seasonable kind Whis-
peis to our Souls, which it is plain, are directed
for the Advantage of Life.
It seems hard that Mankind should be so open
to the secret Insinuators the whispering Devils I
have been speaking of, who are Night and Day,
sleeping and waking, working upon his Senses by
the Arts and Sub til ties of Hell, to fill his Ima-
gination with a thousand devilish Contrivances
to gratify his Vanity and Lust; and that our
Thoughts should be always ready to receive the
impressions they make, pressed to follow the
internal Counsel, be awake to listen to all his
Directions, but should be deaf to the Instructions
of any kind Spirits that would influence us for our
Advantage, and insensible of those impressions which are made upon us for our immediate Good,
by an Agent Good in itself, and acting from a
'Principle whatever it be, of Good to us.
We have a foolish Saying, though taken from
Something that is more significant than we ima-
gine when any Danger has suprifed us. Well,
my mindmisgave me> when I was going about it:
Well, I knew some mischief would come of it;
did you so? And why then did you do it? Why
did you go on? Why, when your Mind misgave
you, did you not obey the friendly Caution?
Whence do you think your Mind received the
speaking, this' silent Impression? Why did ybu
not
r "Hctt listen to it, ar to a voice? For such £ one, it was no doubt; and let all those unthinking Peo-
ple who go on in any Thing they are upon, con-
trary to those secret silent Impressions upon their
Minds; I fay, let them know and observe it*
they will very seldom fail of meeting some Mis-
chief in the Way. They will very seldom fail of
miscarrying in the Way; I say very seldom^ be-
cause I would not take upon me to piescnbp
Things positively, which the Reader will take
me up short in, and fay, how do I know it? But
I will take the Liberty to fay, I durst be posi-
tive in it, relating to my self, and I durst be po-
sitive from the Nature and Reason of the Thing.
As to my own Experience, I wave saying much
of it, but that in general I never flighted these
impulses, but to my great Misfortune; I never
listened to and obey a them," but corny great Ad-
vantage, but I choose to argue from the Reason
of them, rather than from my own experience.^ As they are evident Warnings of what is to
come, atjd are testified daily and hourly by the things coming to pass afterwards, so they are
undeniable Testimonies, that they proceed from some Being, intelligent of those Things that are
at Hand, while they are yet to come. If then
I am satisfied that it is a notice given from a
Something, be it what it will, which is fully in-
formed 4 of what is attending me, tho' concealed from me; why should I flight the Hint given
me from any Thing that knows, what I know
not, and especially, for Example, for avoiding
Evils to come.
I know a person, who had so strong an Impressi-
on upon her Mind, that the House (he was in
would be burnt that very Night, that flie could
not go to sleep, the Impulse flie had upon her
D d 3 Mind..
Mind pressed her not to go to Bed, which how-
ever (he resisted and went to Bed, but was so
terrified with the Thought, which as (he call'd
it, run in her Mind, that the House would be
- burnt, that she could not go to sleep.
She had made so much Discovery of her Ap-
prehensions in the Family, that they were all
in a Fright, and applied themselves to search
from the Top of the House to the Bottom, and
to see every Fire, and every Candle safe out, so
that, as they all said, it was impossible any
Thing could happen in the -House, and they sent
to the Neighbours on both Sides to do the like.
Thus far they did well>hut had she obeyed the
hint, which prest upon her strangely not to go
to Bed, she had done much better, for the Fire
was actually kindled at that very Time, tho' not
broken out.
, In about an Hour, after the whole Family was
in Bed, the House just over the Way, directly
opposite, was all in a Flame, and the Wind
which was very high, blowing the Flame upon
the House this Gentlewoman lived in, so fill'd it
with Smoke and Fire in a few Moments, the
Street being Narrow,, that they had not Air to
breath, or Time to do any Thing, but jump
out of their Beds and save their Lives; had she
1 obey'd the Hint given, and not gone to Bed, she
might have, saved several Things of Value,
which she lost; but as she neglected that, and
would go to Bed, the Moments flie had spared
to her, were but just sufficient to get out of Bed,
get some Cloaths on, aud get down Stairs, for, the House was on Fire in half Quarter of an
Hour. s . - . i f >
It might be ask'd here, why could not the
fame kind Spirit have intimated by the fame
h, i . , « '' - Whik
Whispers, where the Danger lay, and from what
Quarter it was to be expected; in what Man-
ner the Fire would attack them, and that it would' come from the other Side of the Street, the Wind blowing it directly upon them?
To this, I answer, that it is our business the
more vigilantly to observe and listen to the Hints
which are given, seeing the Intimations are not
so Particular as we might wish, without enqui-
ring into the Reasons, why they are given no
plainer. "We have a great deal of Reason to be-
lieve tht kind Spirit that gives these Intimations
andWhisperSj thus to us; gives us all the Light
it is permitted to give, ^nd whispers as much,
either as it knows, or as it is allowed to commu-
nicate; otherwise, why does it give any Inti-
mations at all? But on the other Hand, it may
be alledg'd, that enough is intimated to suffice
for our Safety, if we will obey the Intimation;
and it would be a much more reasonable Que-
stion, to i ask, why we slight and disobey the Im-
pression that we acknowledge to have received,
rather than why the Intimation was no plainer.
A Person of my Acquaintance being to go to
New-England by sea, two Ships presented, and
the Masters earnestly solicited to take him as a
passenger ; he asked my Advice, professing, that
as well the Ships, as the Captains, were perfect-
ly indifferent to him, both the Men being equally
agreeable to him, and the Vessels equally good. I had mj; Eye upon this notion of impulses, and
I prest y to observe strictly, if he hadn't force secret motion of his mind to one Ship rather
than another, and he said he had not.
After some Time he accidentally met one of
the Captains, and falling into Terms with him,
agreed for his passage, and accordingly prepar'd
Dd 4
to go on board *, but from the very Time that
he made the Agreement, nay, even while he was
making the bargain, he had a strong impression on his "mind, that he should not go in that
Ship.
It was some Days after this, that he told me
of these impressions, which increased on him e-
very Day upon which I prest him earnestly not
to go, but to take Passage with the other. Af-
tet he had resolved upon this, he came to me,
and told me, that he had with some Difficulty,
"and some Loss, put off the first Ship, but that
now he had the fame, or rather stronger Aversi-
on to going in the second Ship, and had a strong
impression on his Mind, that if he went in the
second Ship he should be drowned; I bid him
consider it a little, and tell me if he had any
farther intimations of it; and he continued to
tell me, that he had be Rest about his going in
either of those Ships, and yet his Affairs lay so,
that he was under a necessity of going, and
there was no other Ship put up upon the Ex-
change for going.
I pressed him, however, not to venture by any
Means; I convinced him, that those impulses of
his Mind were the whispers of some kind Spi*
rit, that saw Things farther than he could, and
were certainly given him as Cautions to save
him from some Mischief which he might not
foresee; that it could *be no evil Spirit, because
the keeping him back could be no injury to
him, of such a Nature as would gratify/the De-
vil in any Part of his usual Desires; itjziust there-
fore be something for his Good, and he ought
to be very cautious "how he flighted the silent Ad-
monition. In a Word, I prepossessed him so much
in aid of the secret impulses of his own mind:, • 1 1 that
that he resolved not to go that Year, and he
law clearly afterwards, that the secret Intimati-
mation was from a good Hand, for both the
Ships miscarried j the first being taken by the
Turkeyand the latter cast away and all the Men
lost, the Ship foundring at Sea, as was supposed,
for she was never heard of.
I could fill this Tract with Accounts of this
Nature, but the Reason of the Case is stronger
than the Example ; for as it is an Intimation of
something future, and that is to come to pass, it is
certain, there is a State in which what is Future
and must come to pass is known, and why should we not believe the News, if it comes from the
place where the Certainty of it is known?
Some give all this to a Prescience peculiar to
the Soul it self, and of kin to that we call the
Second Sight; but I see no Ground for this, but
mere presumption. Others call it an afflatus,which they think is a Distemper of the Brain-
Others call it a Sympathetick Power in the Soul,
foreboding its own Disasters. But all this is
short of the Thing, for here is not a Foreboding
only, which indeed is often felt, but is expressed
another way,* but here is a direct Intelligence,- a
plain Intimation of the Evil, and warning to a-
void it: This must be more than an afflatus,more
than a Sympathy; this must be from a certain
Knowledge of a Thing that exists not, by a Some-
thing that does exist; and must be communicated
by a Converse of Spirits unembodied, with the
Spirit embodied, for its Good j unless you will
call it Divine Revelation, which I fee no Ground
for.
All these Reasonings make it abundantly our
Concern to regard these Things, as what we are
greatly concerned in j However that is not the chief
1 Use
Use I make of them here, but (i.) they abundantly
explain the Nature of the World of Spirits,' and the Certainty of an Existence after Death; (2.)
they confirm that the Disposition of Providence
concerning Man, and the Event of Things, are
not so much hidden from the Inhabitants of that
^world as they are from us; as also (r) that Spirits
linembodied fee with a Sight differing from us,
and are capable of knowing what attends us,
Wheli we know nothing of it our selves.
This offered many useful' reflections to my
mind, which, however, xv, impossible for me to
communicate with the fame vivacity, or to ex press with the fame Life, that the impression they make on my own Thoughts came with.
1. The Knowledge of there being a World of
Spirits, may be many Ways useful to us, and espe-
cially that of their seeing into Futurity, so as to
be able to communicate to us, by lwhat Means so-
ever' they do it, what we shall, or shall not don
Or what shall, or shall not befall u$ to communi-
cate dangers before us, so as they may' be avoided,
and Mischiefs awaiting us, so as they may be pre-
vented, and even Death it self, so as we may pre-
pare for it > for we may certainty, if we would at-
tend to these things, encrease our Acquaintance
with them, and that very^much to our advantage. I would befarfroin prompting the crazy Imagina-
tions of Hypocondriac Distempered Heads, which
run Men out to so manyExtravagancies,and which
in fixing their thoughts upon the real World
of Spirits, make this an imaginary World of Spi-
rits to them who think they are talked to from
the invisible World, by the Howling of every Dog,
or the Screeching of every Owl. I believe it was
much of this vapourish dreaming Fancy, by which the Augurs of ihcRomans determined Events from the
Flying of Birds, and the Entrails of Beasts. It will
be hard for me tobe prevailed on to suppose,
that even those intelligent Spirits which I speak of,
who are able by suchr easy Ways, as the Impul-
ses of our Minds, Dreams, and the like, to con-
vey the Knowledge of Things to us, can be put
to the necessity, or find Reason to make Use of
the Agency of Dogs and Birds, to convey their
Notices by ;' this would be to suppose them to
be much more confined in their Converse with us,
than we evidently find they are; and on the other
Hand would suppose the inanimate World to have
more Knowledge of the invisible, than we have,
whereas on the Other Hand we know they have no-
thing at all to do with it.
These is only this to be said for it, namely,
that those inanimate Creatures do it involunta-
rily, and as it were, under the Power of a Pos-
session. ~
I will not affirm, but that the invisible Inhabi-
tants I have been speaking of,' may have Power to
aft upon the brute Creatures, so as to employ
them, or make use of their Agency in the Warn-
ings and Notices which they give to us of things to come i but^hatthe Brutes have otherwise a-
xiy farther Sight of Things than we have, I can
fee nothing at all of that. It is true, Balaam's
Ass saw the Angel with the flaming Sword, stan-
ding in the Road, when the Prophet did not,
but the Reason is plainly expressed ; the Angel
was really there, and actually presenting Terror
to them with d flaming Sword in his Hand, on-
ly the Prophets Eyes were miraculously witheld,
that he could not fee him.
I shall unriddle this Mystery of the Agency of
Beasts, and Birds, as far as Reason dictates;
and it seems to be Easy upon the Scheme of the
«*, . , * < v, . Near-
^eatn,ess q{ the Spirits I am speaking of to
and their concern to convey Intelligence to us:
They may, I fay, have Power to Terrify the
Brutes by horrible apparitions to them, so as tq
force those Hqwlipgs and Scjreichings we have
been told of, and to do this < in such Places, an4
at such Times as shall suit with the Circumstances
of the Family or Person concerned, and so far
their said extraordinary Howlings and Screichingj
may be significant; but that the Brutes can ei-
ther by sense, or by extraordinary Sight have any
Foreknowledge of Things in Futurity relating to us, or to themselves; this has no foundation in
Reason or Philosophy any more than it has in Re-
ligion. Matter may act upon material objects, and so the Understanding or Sense of a Brute
may act upon visible objects, but Matter cannot
aiffc upon immaterial Things, and so the Eye of a
Beast cannot sec a Spirit, or the Mind of a brute act upon Futurity, Eternity 3 and the sublime
things of a State to come.
What Use then the Spirits we speak of, inhabi-
ting the invisible World, can make of the inani-
mate world to direct them, as Missionaries to us,
I do not fee, neither did I in all my Altitudes
perceive they employ'd any re agents. It is from the J4iftinderstanding of these things that we place abundance of Incidents meerly for-
tuitous to the Devils account, which he knows
nothing of; many a Storm blows that is none
of his raising; many a midnight Noise hap-
pens that is none of his making,- if Satan or his
instruments had one Tenth Part of the Pow-
er, either of the Air, or in the Air, or over the
Elements, that we give them in our Intent ions, we should have our Houses burnt every night, Hurricanes rased in the Air* Floods made in the
Come Country, and in a Word, the World would not be habitable: But you remember I told you, as
powerful as he is, he is chains he has a great
Clog at his Foot, and he can do nothing by Vio-
lence, or without Permission.
I might hint here at abundance of idle ridicu-
lous Devils, that we are daily told of, that come
and only make Game among us, put out our Can-
dles, throw Chairs and Stools about the House,
break Glasses, make a Smoak, a Stink of Brim-
stone, &c. whereas after all, the Devil has no
more Sulphur*about him than other Folks, and I
can answer for it, that Satan is not disposed for
Mirth; all the Frolicks and Gambols we ascribe
to him, I dare say, are Anticks of our own Brain.
I heard of a House in Essex,which they told me
was haunted, and that every Night the Devil or
a Spirit, call it which you will, came into such a
Room, and made a most terrible knocking, as if
it had a Hammer or a Mallet, and this for two
or three Hours together: At length, upon looking
about in an empty Closet in tljat Room, there
was found an old Mallet, and this was presently
concluded to be the Mallet which the Devil made
such a Noise with, so it was taken away: But
the next night they said, the Devil made such a.
Racket for want of the Mallet, that they were
much more disturbed than before, so they were ob-
liged to leave the Mallet there again, and every
Night the Devil would come and knock in the
Window, for two or three Hours together with
that Mallet. I have seen the room, and the
Mallet, in neither of which was any Thing ex-
traordinary, but never heard the Noise, though
I sat up to wait for it; nor after causing the Mal-
let to be taken away, was there any Noise ,* be 
like
like the mannerly Spirit would not disturb us who
were Strangers.
This pass'd f§>r a most eminent Piece of Walk-
ing or Haunting, and all the difficulty was to
enquire, to what Purpose all this Disturbance was
made, seeing there was no End answered in it,
and I always thought the Devil was too full of
business to spend his Time to no manner of Pur-
pose.
At last, all the Cheat was discovered, to, that
a Monkey kept in a House three or four Houses
from it, had found the Way finto that Room,
and came every Night almost about Midnight,
and diverted himself with the Frolick, and then
went Home again.
If these Things were not frequently detected,
it would be a great Scandal upon the Devil, that
he had nothing to employ himself in, more signi-
ficant, than Rapping all night with a Hammer
to fright and disturb the Neighbours, making
noises, putting out Candles, and the like: When »
we come into the invisible State, of which we
now know to little, we shall be easily convinced,
that the Devil is otherwise employs and has Bu-
siness of much more Importance upon his Hands.
It would be very insignificant, to have us so fre-
quently warned against Satans Devices, to have us
be caution'd to be sober and vigilant, knowing that
our adversary the Devil, goes about like a roar-
ing Lion, seeking, &c. Ail these Things import,
that he is diligent in attacking us, watching all
Advantages, hunting us down, circumventing,
waiting, and constantly plying us with snares that
he may trapan and devour us: This admits not
any of those simple, ludicrous, and senseless Di-
gressions, which we set him to work upon in our
A Imaginations*
Perhaps
Perhaps, it may be expected I flbould enter hereupon the Subject: of Apparitions, and discourse
with equal Certainty of that yet undecided Que-
stion, concerning the Reality of Apparitions,
and whether departed Souls can revisit the Place
of their former Existence, take up Shapes, Bodies,
and visible and apparent Beings,aflbme Voices,and
concern themselves with the Affairs of Life, of
Families, Persons, and even of Estates, and the
like, as many have affirmed they have been Wit-
nesses to.
I must be*allowed to leave this where I find it;
there are some Difficulties which I am not yet got
over, in it, nor have I been elevated high enough
to determine that Point, and shall not venture to
decide it, without more certainty than I am yet
arrived to.
I would warn all People not to suffer their Ima-
gination!, to form Shapes and Appearances where
there are none; and I may take upon me to fay,
that the Devil himself does not appear half so of-
ten, as some People think they fee him; Fancy go-
verns many People, and a sick Brain forms strange
Things to itself: But it does not follow from
thence that nothing can appear, because nothing
does at that Tifbe.
However, asipiy Design is to instruct, not a-
muse, so I say, Iforbear to enter upon a subject, which I must leave as doubtful as I find it, and
consequently talk of to no Purpose*
I have heard of a Man that would allow the
Reality of Apparitions, but would have it be no-
thing but the Devil, that the Souls of Men de-
parted or good Spirits never appeared, it happened
that to this very Man something appear'djas he (aid,
and insisted upon it to the last: He said he saw
the Shape of an ancient Man pass by him in the
Dusk
Dusk of the Evening, who holding up his Hand,
as it were in a threatning Posture, said aloud, O
wicked Creature, repent, repent. He was exceedingly
terrified, and consulted several People about it,
Who all advised him seriously to take the Advice;
for his Life made it well known it seems, that he
stood in need of it: But being seriously debating
about it, one of his Friends asked what he thought
of the Apparition, and whether it was any of the
Devils Business to bid him Repent; this puzzled
his Thoughts, and in a Word, he grew a very so-
ber Man: But after all, it was a real Man, and no
Apparition that {poke to him, though his frighted
Fancy made him affirm that he vanisli'd out of his
Sight, which he did not. And the Person who
did it, being a Grave atfd pious Gentleman, met
him by mere Accident without any Design* and
spoke as he did, from the Knowledge he had of his
being indeed a most wretched wicked Fellow: By
the Way<> the Gentleman had the Opportunity to
hear the Life that was made of it, and to hear
himself mistaken for an apparition of the Devil,
but he was so prudent as not to discover it to the
Man, lest the Reformation, which was the Con-
sequence of the Fright, should wear off, when he
should know, that there was nothing in the Thing
but what was common.
If we would always make the like good Use of
Satan s real Appearances, I do not know but it
would go a great Way to banish him from the vi-
sible World; for I am well assur d he would very
seldom visit us, if he thought his Coming would
do us any Good; at least he would never come,
but when he was sent, he would never come wil-
lingly: For he is so absolutely at the Divine Dis-
posal, that if Heaven commands, he muft go*
though it were to do the good he abhors; not
* that
that I believe Heaven ever thinks fit to employ him in doing Good, if ever he is let loose, 'tis to act in
Judgment as an Instrument of Vengeance, and
some are of Opinion, he is often employed as
a destroying Angel, tho'Ido not grant that; lean
, hardly think the justice of God would gratify
Satan's Gust of doing Evil, so far as to suffer him
to be even so much as an Executioner: But that is
by the way. v I have another Turn to give this Part of my
Observations, Which tho' perhaps some may not think so much to the purpose, as entring into
* a critical Enquiry after the Devils particular
Million in these Cafes: Yet I think otherwise.
I have observed, that some desperate People
make a very ill use of the general Notion, that there
are no Apparitions, nor Spirits at all * and really
the Use. they make of it, is worse than the ex-
treme of those, who, as I said, make Visions
and Devils of every Thing they fee or hears
For these Men persuade themselves there are no
Spirits at all, either in the visible or invisible
World, and carrying it on farther, they next an-
nihilate the Devil, and believe nothing about
him, either of one kind or another*
This would not be of so much bad Consequence^
if it was not always followed by a worse; namely*
that when they have prevailed with themselves to*
believe there is no Devil, the next Thing is, and
they soon come to it, thatthere is no God,and fa
Atheism takes its rise in the fame Sink, with a
Carelesnese about Futurity.
'I have no Mind to enter upon an Argument to
prove the being of our Maker, and to illustrate
his Power by Words, who has so many undeniable
Testimonies in the Breasts of every rational Being
to prove his Existence: But I have a Mind to con-
35 § elud^'
elude this Work with a short history of some A theists, which I met with many Years ago,
and whether the Facts are testified or not, may
be equally useful in the Application, if you do
not think them a little too Religious for you.
Some Years ago, there was a young Gentleman, a Scholar at the University, eminent for Learn-
ing and Vertue, of prompt Parts, and great Pro-
ficiency, insomuch that he was taken great No-
tice of by the Masters and Fellows, and eveiy
one promised fair in their Thoughts for him, that
he would be a great Mats It happened, when-* ther from his earnest Desire of more Knowledge,
or the Opinion of his own great Capacity, I know
not which; that this Gentleman falling upon the
Study of Divinity, grew so opinionative, so very
positive and dogmatic in his Notions in religious
Things, that by Degrees it came to this Height,
that his Tutor saw plainly, he had little more than
Notions in all his religious Pretences to Know-
ledge, and concluded, he would either grow
Enthusiastic or obstinately, Profane and Athei-
siiek.
He had three Chums or Companions in his Stir- *
dies, and they all fell into the fame Error, as well
by the Consequence of a great deal of Wit and
little Grace, as by the Example and Leading of
this other young Gentleman, who was indeed
their Oracle, almost in every Thing.
As his Tutor who was a very good Man, seated
for him, so it came to pass with him, and all the
rest; for they ran upjtheir superficial Notions in
Divinity to such a Height, that instead of Rea-
soning themselves into good Principles of Reli-
gion, they really reasor/d themselves out of all
Religion whatsoever; running on to expunge
every right Idea from their Minds,pretcnding those
Things
Things really were not, of which they could not
define both how and what they were; they pro-
ceeded to deny the Existence of their Maker, the
Certainty of a future State, a Resurrection, a Judg-
ment, a Heaven, or a Hell.
They were not contented to satisfie themselves
with these impious Foundations, but they set up
to dispute in private Societies against all revealed
Religion; thereby bringing on themselves the Curse
denounced in Scripture against those, that do Evil
and teach Men so to do; in a little Time they grew
so publick, that more Company came in, and
which was worse, many joined with them in
Principle or as I should rather have said, in cast-
ing off all Principles, and they began to be famous
in the. Place, though to the Offence of all good Men,
and were call d, The Atheistical Club.
They soon began to fee sober/eligious People shun them, and in some Time, upon'Information given3
they were obliged by Authority, to separate for Fear of Punishment, so that they could not hold
their publick Disputations, as they began to do;
yet they abated nothing of their wicked Custom;
and this dreadful Creature, who set up at the
Head of the rest, began to be so open in his
blasphemies, that he was at Length obliged to fly
from the University.
However, he went a great while before it came
to that; &nd though he had been often admonish-
ed, yet instead of reclaiming, he grew the more
impious, making the most Sacred Things his
jest, and the subject of his Ridicule: He gave
out, That he could frame a new Gospel, and a
much better systemof religion, than that which
they cail'd Christian and that if he would trouble
himself to go about it, he would not fail to draw
in as great a Part of the World to run after him,
£c 2 i as
as had been after any other. I care not to repeat
any of his blasphemous Words, it is not to be
supposed there can be any blasphemous abominable
thing that this Set of wicked wretched young
men did not run into, neither any Wicked-
ness of that kind within their Reach, which they
did not commit. It would be too long to enter into the particu-
lar History of these Men, and how it pleased
God to dispose of them j they might be in Number
before they separated about twenty-two in all, I
shall tell you of some of them however, who did
not run Inch Lengths as the rest: There was a
young Man, who frequented their Society, though
as he afterwards said, he was rather persuaded to
be among them, than to be one of them > he had
however too much yielded to their Delusions;
and though they made him very much their jest, because they found he still retained some little sense of a God, and of a future State in his Mind, yet
he had yielded dreadfully to them, and began to do
so more and more every Day.
It happen'd one Day, this young Man was going
to their hellish Society, and not minding the Wea-
ther, the Clouds gathered over his Head, and he
was stopped by a sudden Shower of Rain in the
Street: It rained so very hard, that it obliged him
to stand up in the Gate-way of an Inn for some
Time; while he was standing here, a great Flash
of Lightning more than ordinarily surpriz'd him;
it seems the Fire coming so directly in his Face,
that he felt the very Warmth of ir, and was ex-
ceedingly startled ,* in the fame Moment almost,
a* is natural in the Cafe> followed such a Clap of
Thunder that perfectly astonished him. , The Rain
continuing,kept him in the Gate-way, asIsaid,fora
good While, till he had Time for such Reflect: ons,
as
C
as these3 Where am I going! What am Igoing about /
£f%0 /V /> Ææj (lop me thus! Why are these Thunder s%
these Rains ,andthis Lightning thus 'Terrible?and whence
are they! and with the rest came in this Thought,
warm and swift as the lightning, which had terri-
fied him before, What if there should be a God! What'sbecome of me then ! Terrified with these Things,
he starts out of the Gateway into the Street not-
withstanding the Wet, and runs back through the
Rain, faying to himself as he went, 'Iwill go among
them no more! When he came Home to his Cham-
bers, he fell into dreadful Agonies of Mind, and at
length broke out thus: What have I been doing!have I
been denying the powerthat made me! Despising that
God whose Fire flash'd jufl now in my Face! And
which* had not that Mercy I have abused interposed^
might have burnt me to Death! What kind of Creature
am I! While he was thus giving vent to his Re-
flections, a near Relation of his, a pious good
Man, who had often used to speak very plain-
ly to him of the horrid Sin he was guilty of, hap-
pened to come to visit him.
The young Man had thrown himself upon his
Bed, and had with the deepest sense of his Mad-
ness, and most serious Reproaches of himself for
his horrid Life, been expressing himself to his
Friend, and he had been comforting him in the
best Manner he could, when after a while he desir'd
his Friend to retire, that he might be a little alone,
and might give vent to his, Thoughts with the
more Freedom, and his Friend, taking a Book it)his Hand, staid in the outer room. In this Interval came another Scholar to the
Door, who was one of the wicked Company I
mentioned just now: He came not to visit this
first Gentleman, but to call him to go with him to
the usual Meeting of their dreadful Society. And
E e 3 knocking
/
knocking at his Chamber Door; this Gentleman,
who was left in, the Chamber, stept to the Door,
and looking through a little Grate, not only knew
the Person, but knew him to be one of the wicked
Company I have been speaking of: Now as he
was very loath, his Friend should have such an In-
terruption to the good Disposition he was then in,
so above all, he was loth he should be persuaded
to go any more among that miserable Gang;
wherefore he opened the Door a little Way, so
as he was not very distinctly seen, and speaks aloud
in the Person of his Friend thus: O Sir, Beseech
them all to repent;for depend upon it, There is a
God, tell them, I fay so; and with that he shut
the Door upon him violently, giving him no Time
to reply, and going back into his Friends Room,
took no Notice of any Body having been at the
Door at all. The Person who knocked at the Door, you may
suppose, was one of the Leaders of the Company,,
a young Scholar of good Parts and Sense, but de-
bauch d by that horrid Crew; and one that
had made himself eminent, for his declared Oppo-
sition to all the common Notions of Religion; a
complete Atheist and publicity so, without God
or the Desire of God in the World: However,
(as he afterwards confessed) the Repulse he met with
at the Door, and which he thought came from his
friend,gave him a strange Shock at first, and filled him with Hqrror: He went down the College-
Stairs in the greatest Confusion imaginable, and
went musing along a good Way, not knowing
where he was, or whither he went, and in that
Embarrassment of Thought went ja whole Street
out of the Way; the Words had made an unusual
impression upon his Mind, but he had* his other
surprises too 3 for he Thought his Friend, for he
bclievd
believd firmly that it was he that had spoken to him,
had treated him very rudely.
Sometimes he resented it, and reflected upon it
#s an Affront, and once or twice was upon the
Pomt of going back again to him, to know the
Reason of his using him so, and to demand Satis-
faction: ButstiU the Words, THERE IS A GOD,
dwelt upon his Mind, and what if it stoould be so?
fays he, what then? Upon this Question to him-
self, the Answer immediately occurred to his Mind,
What then! tVhy, then I am undone; for, have not
J d clard War against the very Notion, deffd all the
Pretenders to tt> as mere 'Enthusiasts and Men of
Whimsy? However, after these Thoughts his
Mind cooled a little again, and it offered to him,
no doubt in jetted by an EvilSprit, that he should not
trouble himself with enquiring into it one Way op
another, but be easy.
This pacified him for a little While, and he
fliook off the Surprise he was in; the hardned
Temper scem'd to return, and he kept on his Way
towards the hellish Society, that he was go»ng to
before: But still the Words returned upon him,
THERE IS A GOD, and began to bring
some Terror with it upon his Mind; and the
last Words of his Friend came into his Mind often^
tell them, I fay Jo, this fill'd him with a Curiosity
which he could not withstand, » of going back
to his Friend, and enquiring of him, what Disco-
veries he had made of this Kind ? how he came to
have changed his Mind so suddenly? and especially*
how he was arrived to a Certainty ot the Thing?
I tpld you, that there had been a great Shower
of Rain, which had stopp'd the first joung Gen-
tleman in his Way out; it seems the Day was still
showery and 'a little Rain happening to fall again,
as this Gentleman went by a Bookseller's Shop*
Ee 4 he
h§ stops at the Door to stand up a little out of the wet.
There happens to be sitting in the Shop reading
a Book, a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, though
far differing from him in his Principles, being a
very sober, studious, religious young Man, a Stu-
dent in Divinity of the fame College, who look-
ing up called him in, and after a few common Sa~.
lutes, he whispers in his E$r.
Student, I was looking in an old Book here just
now, and began the following short Dialogue ; and
I found four Lines written on the Back of the Title
Page, which put me in Mind of you.
Atheist, Me 1 why 4*4 they put you in Mind of
me ?<
Stud. I'll tell you presently, *come hither.
* He retires into a back.Room,and calls the
other after him.4th. Well, now tell me.
Stud. Because I think they are very fit for such
(in atheistical Wretch as you to read.
Ath. 'You are very Civil.
Stud. You know you deserve it.
Ath. Come, let me fee them however.
Stud. Let me look in your Face all the While
then.
Ath. No you shan't.
Stud. Then you shan't fee them.
Ath. Well, let it alone then.
Stud. Come give me your Hand, you stall fee
them,, if you will promise to read them over three
times. AtL There s my Hand> I'll read them try out to
* ° v §tudL
Stud. FU hold your Hand all the While, because
I'll be sure of your Performance.
Ath. I'll warrant you I'll *read them.
* He reads.
But if it should fall out, as who can tell?
That there MAY BE a God, a Heaven and
* Hell:
Had I not best consider well, for fear
*T fliou'd be too late when my Mistakes appear.
* \ * He held him by the Hand till that wordand then hitit go: pressing gently one of
his fingers.Stud. Well, what do you fay to them?
Ath. I'll tell you my thoughts farther by and
by, but first tell me what did you press my Hand
for when you let it go.
Stud. Did you feel no Motion within you, when
you read those Words, theremay be a God.
Ath. What Motion? What do you talk of?
m Stud. Come do not deny it, for I am a witness against you.
Ath. Witness, for what? I have kill'd no Body,
I have robb'd no Body ; if you would turn Informer,
I value not your Evidence.
Stud. No, no, I shall not turn Informer of that
Kind, but I am a witness in your Maker's Behalf.
Ath. What can you Witness?
Stud. I'll tell you what I can Witness, I can te-
tify, that your own Conscience is against you, in
your impious denying the existence of that God
that gave you Life; You could not conceal it, I tell
you lUkn.
Ath
Ath. How do you pretend to know, what my
Conscience dictates to me, or what the Result of
secret Reflections may be in the Mind? You may
be mistaken, have a Care; you know you are not to
bear false witness,Stud.It's in vain tp struggle with it, 5tis not to
to be concealed, you betray'd yourself, I tell you,
Ath. How betrayed myself? you are mighty dark
in your Expressions.
Stud. Did I not tell you, I would look in your
Face all the While you read? Did I not fee into the
Distraction of your Soul? Did you not turn pale at
the very Words, when your Tongue said, theremay
be a God?Was there not a visible Horror in your
Countenance, when you read the Word HEAVEN?
A Horror, which signified a sense of your having
no Share in it, or Hope about it? And did I not
feel a 'trembling in your very Joints, as I held you
by the Hand, when you read the Word HELL?
Ath. And was that it you held me by the hand for?
Stud. Indeed it was; I was persuaded I should
find it; for I could never believe, but an Atheist
had always aHell within him, even while he braved it out against a Hell without him.
Ath. You speak enough to fright one; how can
you say so positively a Thing, which you cannot
be sure of?
Stud. Never add Sin to Sin, 'tis in vain to deny
it.
Ath. Well, well, its none of .* your Business;
who made you my Father Confessor?
cl? He is a little angry.$tud. Nay do norjbe angry mih your 'friend,
and though you are, do but take the Hint, and be
as Angry as you will. Ath. What
Ath. What Hint, what is it you aim at ? your
Hints are all so general, I can make nothing of
them.
Stud. I aim at nothing but your eternal Felicity?
I thought those Lines very apposite to your Cafe,
and was wishing you had them, before I happened
to see you; I thought, that such a reflection in
the Case of Atheism, sp natural, so plain, espe-
cially blessed from him, whose secret Voice can effectually
reach the mind,might be some Means to open your
eyes, Ath. Open mine Eyes! to what?
Stud. To something that I am persuaded you see
already in Part, though I find you struggle hard
against yonr own convictions, Ath. What is this something you speak of?
Stud, I mean in a few Words, what the Lines
you have read mean3 viz,. That perhaps there may
be a God, a Heaven, and Hell.
Ath. I don't know* but there may.
He observes 'Tears (lands in his eyes*Stud. Well, I fee it begins to touch you, if you
are uncertain,that is a Step to conviction ; and the
rest of the Words you have read, are a most natural
Inference in your Cafe.
* Toud best conjider well for Fear3
'Tfhou'd be too late when your Mistakes appear
Ath. What would you have me consider?
Stud. I am not able to enter into that Part now;
the first Thing is to persuade you to look in; listen
to the Voice of Conscience, I am satisfied you
stand convicted at that Bar, you cannot plead notguilty there.
Ath Con-
Ad,convicted of what?
Stud. Of having acted contrary to the Light of
Nature, of Reason, and indeed of common Sense;
Bioft impiously denied the God whose Air you
breath in, whose Earth you tread on, whose Food
you eat, whose Cloaths you wear, who is your
life, and will be your Judge
Atb. I do not absolutely deny,- I tell you, I
don't know, but there may be a God.
Stud. Dont you know but there may / O SIR, Ibeseech you repent; for certainly THERE IS A
GOD, depend upon it, I SAY SO.
Atb. lou * Fright me.
* He starts and looks surpri&d.
Stud. Indeed I think it may well Fright you.
Ath. But you fright me upon a quite differing
Account from what you imagine; I am indeed ve-
ry much surprised, and so would you too if you
knew the Circumstance.
Stud. What Circumstance?
Atb. Pray did you hear those Words spoken any
where to Day before you spoke them.
Stud. No, not I.
Atb. Was you at Mr. 's Chamber about
half an Hour ago?
Stud. I have not been there this Month past,
I have given over visiting him, and all such as he
is, long ago.
Atb. Have you seen him to Day, or when did
you last see him, did he speak those/Words to
you, or you to him. /
Stud. I have not seen him, since I saw him with
you about fourteen Days ago, when your Discourse
(even both of you) was so Blasphemous sand so
Atheistical, as made my very Heart tremble, and
I re-
I tesolv'd never to come into Company with ei-
ther of you again, and it was that very Discourse,
that made me think of you when I found those
Lines in this Book; I should think it an evident
Discovery of God, and what I might hope sliould
best forward your conviction, if his Providence
should have sent you to this Door at that Minute,
to receive the hint on this Occasion.
Ath, There is something more than common,
in every Thing that has happened to me to day! Stud. If you would explain yourself a little, I
might say more but you know very well, I can-
not make the least guess at what you mean.
Ath. Ask me no more questions, there must be
A * GOD or A DEVIL in Being.
* He looks wildly and anun£dm
Stud. Dear Friend, there are both, depend upon
it, but I beseech you compose your Mind, and do
not receive the conviction with Horror, but with
Comfort and Hope.
Ath. One or other of them has been concerned
in what has happened to me to Day; it has been a
strange Day with me.
Stud. If it relates only to these Things, perhaps
it may be of Use to you to communicate the Par-
ticulars, at least it may give some vent to the Op-
pression of Thought, which you seem to be under,
you cannot open your Mind to One, that has
more earnest Desires to do you Good, tho' per-
haps not sufficiently furnifh'd to advise you.
Ath* I must tell it or * Burst;
Here hegave him the whole Story of his goingto hs Friend's Chamber> in order to take
him with him to the wicked clubthey had
kept,
kept, and how he had met him at the Door,
and said the same wordsto htm, that the
Student had repeated, and when he had
done, says he to his Friend;
and who now do you think must dictate the fame
Words to him, and afterwards to youto fay to me
on the fame Occasion.
Stud. Who do I think! Nay, who do you think I
Ath. Who! The Devil, if there is a Devil
Stud. Why, do you think the * Devil preaches
Repentance!
* lie stands Stock-still, and Fay'snot a Word%
which the other perceivinggoes on.
Pray think seriously, for I see it does a little touch
your Reason; is it likely the Devil should bid ei-
ther of us, or.both of us, intreat you to repent ? Is
it the Devil think you, that would pronounce the
Certainty of, the great Truth I speak of? Is it his
Business to convince you that there is a God?
Ath. That's very true.
Stud. One Thing however, I'll fay in Satan's
Behalf-, and that is, that he never came up to you*
height of sinning. The Devil has frequently set
up himself, and persuaded poor deluded people to
worship him as a God; but to do him justice,he
never had the Impudence to deny the Being of a ,
God; that's a Sin purely Human, and even among
Men very Modern too, the Invention of witty
Men, as they callthemselves; a Way they have late-
ly found out to cherish superlative Wickedness*
and flatter themselves, that they shall have no Au-
dit of their Accompts in a Future State; of whom
it may indeed be said in that Particular, they have
out-sinnd the Devil
m Ath,
Ath. Indeed I think we have.
. Stud. I wish you would consider a little farther
of it.
Ath. What can Men consider that have gone
that Length?
Stud. Yes, yes, remember what St. Peter said to
Simon the Sorcerer*
^A. What was that?
Stud. Read A&s vni. 22. Repent therefore of this
thy pj/tckednefs, and pray God, ifperhaps the thought
of thine Heart may be forgiven thee.
Ath. No, No, the last of your Verses is against
me there most directly.
Its all TOO LA TE now my Mistakes appear.
Stud. No, no, Remember what you said, that
it must be a God or a Devil.
Ath. What is that to the Purpose?
Stud. Why you scem'd satisfied, that it could not
be from the Devil.
Ath. But what the better am I for that, if the
other is my Enemy?
Stud. Much the better if it was from Gody if the
Words you heard were from God% and that two un-
concerted Persons so eminently concurred in speak-
ing to you, you cannot believe God would bid you
REPENT, if it was too late, or if he were your
irreconcilable Enemy; on the contrary, if you
believe it to be the Vo ce of his Providence, you
ought to listen to and obey it.
Ath. You have a strange Power of Persuasion*
there's no resisting your Argument.
Stud. It is not in me to persuade, but Heaven
may make use of me to convince.
Ath. To convince is to persuade, I am convinced
that I have been a dreadful Wretch.
Stud. I am persuaded you were convinced of that
before. Ath. I
rAth. I cannot deny but my Heart always struck
me, a kind of chill Horror ran through my
Veins, when I have utter'd the blasphemous Opi-
nions that I have been drawn into, my very Blood
stagnated at the Thought of it, and I look back
on it with Astonishment.
Stud. I tell you, I felt a Tremor even in your
Flesh, when you read the Words, a God, a Hea-
ven, a Hell.
Ath. I confess to you my very Heart funk with-
in me at the Words who can tell; my Soul answer'd
that I could tell myself, that it both is, and must
be so.
Stud. Conscience is a faithful and never-failing
Evidence in his Maker's Behalf.
Ath. It is a very terrible Evidence against me, and \Wiere will it End?
Stud. I hope it will End where it began, I
mean in a heavenly call to you to repentance. Ath. That is not always the consequence; of
conviction. Stud. You must therefore distinguish again of
what proceeds from Heaven, what from Hell, the
Voice of God, and the Voice of the Devil; the
first calls upon you to repent, the last prompts
you to despair.
Ath. Despair seems to be the natural Conse-
quence of denying God; for it shuts out the
Power that can alone restore the Mind.
Stud. The greater is that Love which refuses to
be shut out, that fends such a heavenly Summons
to you to repent, and in so eminent a Manner; it
is not your having been an Enemy, a blasphemer, a Deftyer of God ,* Peter denied Christ three
Times, nay, the third Time he even abjur'd him,
and yet mark the VPord^ The Lord look'd on him and immediately he repented.
Ath
Ath. My Case is worse than Peters.
Stud, And yet you see you are call'd on to
repent.
Ath. I think you are call'd to make me repent,
there's no answering you.
Stud. Amen; may I have the blessing of being
an instrument to so good a Work, there seems to
be something extraordinary in it all.
Ath. It's all a surprise to me, how came I hi-
ther! "u, Stud. nay, how came I hither! how came this
Book Kere! who writ the Lines in the Frontis-
piece! how came I to read them ! *tis all a Dream
to me.
Ath. How came you to think of me upon the
reading them ! and how came I here just at the
* Moment, and out of my Way too 1
* He lifts up his Hands and cries out. There
is a God, certainly there is, lam con-
vine'd of it, it muft be so.
k Stud. Nothing more certain; nor is there any
Doubt but all these Things are of him.
Ath. But there are yet greater Things behind, I
wish you wduld go with me to my Friend
Mr. 's Chamber, I am persuaded some-
thing yet more extraordinary must have befallen
him.
^ Stud. With all my Heart, t
Xfhey both go to the first Gentleman's Cham-
berand found him at Every much
mt of Order, but willing enough to dis-
course with them.'
F f Ath.
Ath. Well, Friend of mine, I hope you are bet-
ter dispos'd to your Friends than when I saw you
left. Gwt. Truly when I saw you last, I was disposed
of by the Devil, and so I doubt was you," I hope
I shall never come into that horrid Place again.
Ath. What horrid Place?
Gent. You know where I mean, I tremble at
the very Thoughts of the Place, and much more
of the Company; I wish I could prevail upon you
to come no more among them too I assure you
if I know myself, and if God would assist me
to do it/ I would much rather go to a Stake to be
burnt.
Stud. I rejoice in such an Alteration, Sir, upon
you, I hope our Friend here is of the same Mind,
long may it continue in you both.
Ath. Well, pray tell us something of the Occa-
sion of this happy Alteration; for it will seem still
more strange, how you came to be instrumental to
my Change, if I know nothing of the Means that
brought about your own.
Gent. MineM[ assure you, it was all from Hea-
ven: Not the light that shone about St. Pauly was
more immediately from Heaven, than the Stroke
that touched my Soul; it is true, I had no Voice
without, but a Voice has spoken (I hope ) effe-
ctually to my Understanding, I had Voice enough
to tell me, how I was in the Hands of that Power,
that Majesty, that GOD, whom I had wickedly,
and with a Hardness not to be expressed, disowned
and deny'd.
Stud. Pray Sir, if you care to have it known,
give us some Account of the Particulars of this
wonderful Thing.
Gent.
Gent. Sir, I ftall do it * freely, I think I ought
not to £on£eal it.
* Here he gives an Account of the surprisehe
was in by the Lightning, how he was
stop in his wayto his wicked Corn-
fany, and went backto his Chamber.Ath. Well, now I will no more wonder at the Salutation you gave me, when I came to call you,
but thank you for it.
Gent. What Salutation?
Ath. Why, when I was at your Chamber about
two Hours ago.
Gent. You at my Chamber!
Ath. Nay, you need not conceal it, for I have
told our friend here all the Story.
Gem. I know nothipgof what you talk of, much
less what you mean.
Ath. Nay, what need you go about to conceal
it? I tell you I do not take it ill, I hope I may have
Reason to be thapkful for what you said to me,
and look upon it as spoken from Heaven i for I
assure you, it has been an Introduction to that
Light in my Thoughts, which I hope shall never be
extinguish'd.
Gem. Dear Friend, as I believe you are seripus,
so I hope you believe I am so 3 I profess I know
nothing of all you talk about.
Ath. Why, was I not at your Door this After-
noon, a little after the great Shower of Rain?
Gent. Not that I know of.
"Ath. Why, did hot I knock at your Chamber-
Door, and you come to the Door yourself and
speak to me?
GentNot to day, I am very sure of it.
Ff* 4fb.
Ath. Am I awake! are you Mr. am I
sure we are all alive, and know what we are say-
ing, and to who?
Gent. I beseech you unriddle yourself, for I am
surprised,
Ah.Why, about three a Clock this Afternoon,
I came to this Chamber-Door; fknock'd > you
came and open'd the Door $ I began to speak, you
interrupted me, and
Here he repeats thePassage at large,and his own Thoughts, and Resent-
ment as before.
'Gent. Depend upon it, Was some Voice from
Heaven, it was nothing of mine; I have not been
at the Door since two of the Clock, when I came
first in, but have been on the Bed or in my Study
£ver fiance, wholly taken up with my own Thoughts,
and very much indisposed. The young Man turnspale,and falls
into a Swound.
There was a great deal more belonging to this
Story, but 'tis too long for the present JPurpose> I
have related this Part on scveial Accounts, and it
hits the Purpose I am upon many ways. i. Here is a visible Evidence of God, and of
his Being and Mature fix*d so in the Mind,
that not the most hardivd Atheist qm deny it, Nature recoils at every Endeavour to sup-
press it, and the very Pulsation of his blood shall discover and acknowledge it.
a. Yet
a. Yet even in this, we fee how the Power of
Imagination may be worked up, by the se-
cret Agency of an unknown Hand, how ma-
ny Things concurred to make this Man be-
lieve he had seen an Apparition, and heard
*a Voice, and yet there was nothing in it
but the Voice of a Man unseen and mistaken;
the young Man was so surprised at his
Friends declaring that he knew nothing of
his coming there, that he concluded it had
been all a Vision or Apparition that opened
the Door, and that it was a Voice that had
spoken to him, of what Kind he knew not;
and the reflection upon this surprised him so
much as threw him into a Swound, and yet
here was neither Vision or Voice, but that
of an ordinary person, and one who meant
well, and said well.
It is not to be doubted, but that many an Ap-
parition related with a great deal ot Certainty
in the World, and of which good Ends have fol-
lowed, has been no more than such a serious Mi-
stake as this.
But before I leave it, let me observe, that this
should not at all hinder us from making a very
good Use of such Things; for many a voice may
be directed from Heaven, that is not immediately
spoken from thence; as when the Children cried
Hosannah to our Saviour, they fulfilled the Scrip-
ture, which said out of the Mouths of Babes and
Sucklings thou hast ordain'd Praise so doubtless
he that made all Things and created all Things; ^
may appoint instruction to be given by fortuitous
Accidents, and may direct concurring Circum- *
stances to touch and affect the Mind as much, and
^s effectually, as if they had been immediate and
miraculous. Thus
Thus was the two Persons happening to fay the fame Words to the Atheist, the strange reading of
those Lines, when the per foji eame into the Book-
feller's Shop, the incident of his running into the
Shop for Shelter, and-many the like Things of the
fame Nature, and ordered in the fame manner as
the Cock crowing when Peter denied Christ, which
though wonderfully concurrent With what his
blessed Master had foretold, yet was no extraor-
dinary Thing in a Cock, who naturally Crows at
such a Time of the Morning.
In a Word, all these Things serve to convince
us of a great Super-intendency of Divine Provi-
dence in the minutest Affairs of this World, of a
manifest Existence of the invisible World, of the Reality of Spirits, and of the Intelligence between
us and them. I hope I have said nothing of it to
mis-guide any Body, or to assist them to delude
themselves, having spoken of it with the utmost Se-
riousness in my Design, and with a sincere Desire
for a general good,
