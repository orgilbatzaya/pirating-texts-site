ROBINSON CRUSOE
ROBINSON CRUSOE was born in York,
England, in 1632. From the days of his
childhood, he was very fond of stories of
the sea and would often sit on the shore of
a little stream near his home
and dream, for hours at a time,
of voyages on the water.
Robinson Crusoe had a very
comfortable home and received
a fair education. It was his
father's wish that when he was
old enough, he take up law as
a profession; but the lad had
no taste for it, and when he
was eighteen years of age (the
time this story begins), he was
without a trade.
One day, he told his father
of his great longing to go
aboard a vessel and sail on the
seas. His father listened to him attentively and, in
a very kindly way, tried to make it plain to his son
how dangerous such a trip would be and the many
misfortunes that would surely beset him. He urged
3

him to stay in the old home and pointed out that, by
being industrious and thrifty, he could work up a
nice fortune for himself and live a life of ease and
pleasure.

But Robinson Crusoe's love of the sea and his long-
ing for adventure would not let him listen to the
wise counsel of his parents. He told his mother he
felt that some day he would surely run away. He
was further influenced by the son of a sea captain,
who promised to take him, without paying for his
passage. So, on the first of September, 1651, he ran
away from home and went on a ship bound for Lon-
don.
No sooner was the ship out of the harbor than a
furious gale set in. Robinson Crusoe had never been
on the sea before and the storm frightened him ter-
ribly, while the huge waves made him awfully sea-
sick. He thought this was a punishment sent from
heaven because of his conduct. However, the next
day, when the sea was calm and the weather clear
and beautiful again, Robinson Crusoe felt better and
his mind was more at ease.
Some days after, another storm overtook them, far
more violent than the first. The waves were moun-
tain high and the winds were howling fiercely. The
sea was so rough and heavy that ships were dashed
to pieces. The master and the officers on the vessel
with Robinson Crusoe walked hopelessly back and
forth on deck, muttering under their breaths that they
would all be lost. Suddenly one of the men cried,
"The ship has sprung a leak!" All hands were or-
dered on deck to pump out the water. The ship
creaked and swayed and was tossed about on the
high waves. Robinson Crusoe trembled with fear
when he saw what was going on and fell down in a
faint.
The ship at last began to sink. The captain sig-
naled to another vessel a short distance away that
they were in need of help. The ship hove to and
sent two small boats to the sinking vessel. With
great daring and much difficulty, the men were
safely put aboard.
They sailed back to the town from which they had
started. Friends there were happy to meet the res-
cued men and supplied them with food and clothes
and gave money to those who wished to return to
their homes. While Robinson Crusoe's conscience
prompted him to go back to his parents, his strong
desire for further adventure completely mastered
him.
He made friends with a certain captain of a ship
and with him embarked on a voyage to the coast of
Africa. The captain, a plain, honest man, taught
Robinson Crusoe the rules of sailing and gave him
many valuable points as to trading, so that the
young man made a snug little sum before he re-
turned to England. Soon after their arrival there,
the captain died. A former mate took over the com-
mand of his ship and Robinson Crusoe decided to
accompany him on another trip to Africa.
After they had been sailing for some weeks, they
noticed a Turkish pirate ship following them. The
captain ordered all possible speed put to the boat;
but, unfortunately, the pirates soon caught up.
Sixty of them scrambled aboard and fought Robin-
son Crusoe's companions, killing three of the men
and wounding several others, besides cutting all
the sails. Then they took the men and the crew as
captives to a place called Sallee, belonging to the
Moors, and brought them to the Emperor. Robin-
son Crusoe, however, was made a slave to the chief
of the band.
In his new hardships and sufferings, Robinson Cru-
soe had time to think of his home and of the advice
of his good parents. How he wished he had obeyed
them! but it was too late now.
His master made him work very hard at first, but
as the lad was quick and active, the chief took him
into his house to wait upon him, and always had
Robinson Crusoe with him on his fishing trips.
Thus the poor fellow served the man for two years,
without the least hope of escape.
One day, his master sent Robinson Crusoe out in
a small boat to catch some fish (as some friends were
coming to dine with him), and had a Moor and a
boy named Xury go with him. Robinson Crusoe
now saw his first chance of escape. He told the
Moor to get some powder and shot for the guns that
were already in the boat and also to bring some tools,
while he himself carried food and wine to the ship.
Then they sailed away together.
When they had gone about a mile, they stopped to
fish; but Robinson Crusoe would not pull up his
lines, as he did not want the Moor to see that any
fish were there. He planned to sail further and
further, and when they were far out to sea he in-
tended to throw the Moor, whom he did not trust,
overboard. It all happened just that way. Xury
swore to be true to Robinson Crusoe, so he took the
boy with him. (The Moor swam back to shore.)
They sailed on and on and in a few days they were
far out of reach of the Moors and Turks. But they
had no more food left and it was necessary to find
some. They stopped near an unknown coast and
anchored in the mouth of a little river. They saw
no one about and decided to stay there for the night.
As soon as it was dark, however, they heard barks
and growls and other strange and horrible noises and
would not venture on shore until the morning.
Just as they were about to land, a wild beast came
down to the edge of the water and roared so loudly
that Xury cried out in fear. It plunged into the
river and swam toward the boat. Robinson Crusoe
shot at the animal, wounding it; with a cry of pain,
it fled to the woods and they never saw it again.
When the sun had risen, Xury and Robinson
Crusoe took the boat close up to the shore. Xury
went to search for food and drink and soon returned
with a jar full of water and a hare, which he had shot.
He cooked the meal, and he and his master thor-
oughly enjoyed it.
They sailed on for another ten or twelve days
without any mishaps. As they came to a certain
shore, they saw some black men coming down to the
water's edge. One of them had a long lance and the
rest carried clubs and sticks. As Robinson Crusoe
was again in need of food and drink, he thought of
going up to the black men; but Xury imagined, from
their actions, they meant to kill them and he cried
out anxiously, "No go! No go!"
They still had left a portion of the hare they had
shot before, but they did not like to eat this. So
they threw it to the black men, and by signs Robin-
son Crusoe made them understand that he wanted
some food. When the black men saw that no one
meant to harm them, two of them went off and pres-
ently returned with fruit, dried meat and corn,
which they left on the shore; then all of them ran
away. Robinson Crusoe was glad they did not come
closer, for they were a wild looking set and wore no
clothes.
Robinson Crusoe, with his boy Xury, sailed along
for almost two weeks, but did not meet a single ship.
He was very sad and lonely and yet he could not
help thinking it was all his own fault. One day he
felt particularly unhappy and wondered what he
should do and how he should get food. He did not
dare go on shore, for fear of meeting wild men and
beasts. All at once Xury cried out, "Master, mas-
ter, a ship with a sail!"
Robinson Crusoe's heart went pit-a-pat for very
joy! It was a large ship, but he could not tell from
where it came. He took a small flag he had and
waved it aloft and then shot off his gun. He hoped
by these signals to attract the attention of the men
on the other ship. The people saw the smoke and
dropped anchor; for almost two hours they waited,
until Robinson Crusoe's small boat came alongside
their own.
The ship was from Portugal, bound for Brazil,
South America. A Scotch sailor asked Robinson
Crusoe who he was and from where he came. He
explained how he had been captured and made a
slave by the Moors and how he had escaped with
Xury. The two were then taken on board, together
with all the things that were in the boat. Robinson
Crusoe wanted to present these to the captain, in re-
turn for his great kindness; but the good-hearted
man would accept nothing without paying for it.
Robinson Crusoe never forgot how well he treated
him and Xury.
After so many unpleasant adventures, Robinson
Crusoe made up his mind that when once he reached
dry land again, he would settle there. So when the
captain offered to buy his boat, he let him have it.
The man also wanted to buy Xury, but Robinson
Crusoe hated to sell him for a slave, for he had
grown very fond of the faithful and affectionate boy.
However, the captain promised to give Xury his
freedom in a few years and Robinson Crusoe regret-
fully gave him up.
In a few weeks, the ship landed on the coast of
Brazil and here Robinson Crusoe intended to settle
and become a planter. The money he received for
his boat and other things amounted to quite a sum
and with it he bought a farm. A man named Wells
had a plantation next to his and they got on well to-
gether. Robinson Crusoe learnt many useful things
from his neighbor.
Through the captain of the ship, Robinson Crusoe
sent to a friend at home for some extra money he
had left there, with which to buy more land and im-
prove his farm. He realized what a help Xury
would have been to him now and was sorry indeed
that he parted with him, for, in a short time, he had
to buy two slaves to help with the work on the farm.
The friend who sent Robinson Crusoe his money,
sent with it some cloth, dress goods and small wares,
which proved most useful in trading for other ar-
ticles.
Everything went on well for four years, until one
day, three of Robinson Crusoe's friends confided to
him that they intended to sail to Africa to buy some
slaves and asked him to accompany them. He was
prosperous, had friends and enjoyed many comforts,
but the very mention of a sea voyage seemed to
awaken the old longing for adventure. They fitted
out the ship and Robinson Crusoe arranged his mat-
ters at the farm, making the Portuguese captain his
heir, in case he should not return. He sailed away
exactly eight years from the day he had left his home
in England.
On board this ship there were six guns and a crew
of fourteen men, besides the master, his boy and
Robinson Crusoe. Their cargo consisted of toys,
beads, shells, and other odcl things, which they knew
could be traded for slaves.
For two weeks the water was calm ancj the air
clear and hot. Then a sudden change came. A
fearful storm arose and for three days the ship was
tossing on the high seas. There was but a short
calm, when another storm overtook them. In the
midst of this, one of the men cried out that he spied
land—but just then the ship struck upon a sand
bank! In this dreadful position, they could neither
move nor yet stay there, as they thought the vessel
would break to pieces any moment. The mate
flung a small boat over the ship's side and the men
all got in.
There was little hope of reaching the shore in such
a raging tempest; they felt that only God's mercy
could save them now. They had gone but a short
way when the waves rose so high that they were
all swept into the sea. Robinson Crusoe swam
around in a hopeless way, struggling against the fury
of the waters. He was dashed back and forth toward
the shore until at last he was thrown with such force
against a rock that he was stunned. But he was safe
12
ROBINSON CRUSOE
on land. The first thing he did when he felt better
was to offer a prayer of thanks to God for saving his
life. Then he looked around for the rest of the men,
but there was no sign of them—nothing but a few
hats and shoes floating on the crests of the waves.
After regaining a little of his strength, Robinson
Crusoe wondered where he should sleep, for night
was approaching. All that he had with him were a

knife, a pipe and a little box of tobacco. A short
distance away, he saw a thick tree, like a fir, full of
thorns. Fearing wild men and beasts, Robinson
Crusoe took his knife and made a sharp stick for him-
self, and when it was dark climbed up the tree. Not
a very comfortable bed, was it*? But he was so ex-
hausted that he soon fell asleep.
The next morning, he woke up much refreshed.
He could see the ship nearly a mile away, with one
end sticking up out of the water; the small boat was

so far off that it looked like a mere speck. At noon,
when the sea was calm and the tide low, Robinson
Crusoe swam to the ship. He was grieved to find
that if they had only stayed on board, all would have
been safe and in a short time could have reached the
shore.
Robinson Crusoe climbed up on deck by means of
a strong rope. He searched for bread, for he was
hungry, and was glad to find some unspoilt by the
water. Then he looked around to see what else he
could take back with him on shore.. "But how can
I get them there?" he asked himself. He needed a
boat on which to load the things.
Having found some large spars and some rope and
planks, Robinson Crusoe set to work to construct a
raft as best he could. When this was finished, he
placed three chests upon it (which he found in one
of the rooms of the ship), having first filled them
with bread, rice, cheese, dried meat and corn. On
the raft he also put a large keg of rum.
The tide had now begun to rise, and Robinson
Crusoe noticed that the clothes he had left on shore
were carried out to sea. So he made another search
in the cabins and gathered together enough clothes
for his present needs. He also discovered what to
him was a real treasure chest, containing all sorts of
tools, and this he eagerly put on the raft; also two
guns and two pistols, a bag of shot, two old rusty
swords, some powder horns and two barrels of
powder.
The raft was so large and clumsy and loaded with
so many things that Robinson Crusoe was in fear of
ROBINSON CRUSOE
drifting away from the shore, as the sea had now be-
come heavy again. But he succeeded in making a
safe landing.
He wondered what he could do on this island and
where he would sleep that night, for he was too far
from the spot where he had been the previous day.
Besides, he did not want to leave the things he had

brought from the ship. So he made a rude hut with
the chests and the boards and lay down on the hard
planks. As you can imagine, he did not rest com-
fortably, nor could he rid himself of the fear of wild
animals.
Robinson Crusoe thought of his mother, his father
and his friends and knew they would all mourn him
as dead. But how could he send them word?
There were no ships likely to pass by that deserted
island. The only sign of life was the singing of the
birds and the wild cries of beasts. This was indeed
a lonely place and a lonely life stretched before him.
Although Robinson Crusoe had taken enough food
from the ship to last him several days, he knew there
was more on board and was anxious to get it. So
the next morning he swam out again to the wreck.
He immediately set to work to make a smaller raft,
which he could manage more easily than the first. In
a few hours, the new raft was ready for the load he
put on it—some bags of nails and spikes, saws,
knives, hatchets, two barrels of bullets, eight guns,
powder, shot, a spy glass, a grinding-stone on which
to sharpen his tools, some more clothes, a large sail,
a hammock and a bed. Then he set out for shore.
On his return, he found all the things just as he had
left them.
Robinson Crusoe now thought he would like to
build a tent, in which he could stay and sleep as well
as store his goods. He cut some poles that he needed
and used a large sail for the cover, making a door
out of a few boards and a chest. When the tent was
finished, he put in everything that was likely to be
spoiled by sun or rain. The empty chests and casks
he placed around the tent for protection.
For almost two weeks, he made a daily trip to the
ship, taking from it as much as he could find. Once
he loaded his raft so full that it sank and threw him
and all the things into the sea. But no harm was
done, for Robinson Crusoe could swim well and he
brought back most of the goods. He also found
i6
ROBINSON CRUSOE
some gold, which he thought might be of use to him
at some future time.
On his last trip to the wreck, the wind blew hard
and the sea was rough; he knew a storm was coming.
The following morning, the ship had disappeared
from sight and to Robinson Crusoe it must have
seemed as though he lost a friend.
The ground on which his tent was pitched was low

HK.
and damp; so he walked around the island to find a
better place, where he could also have a view of the
sea and keep on the lookout for a ship.
On the side of a steep hill, there was a level spot,
with a great big rock close by, which had a large hole
like a door to a cave. In front of this rock, Robin-
son Crusoe built two tents — a large one and a smaller
one inside—putting a heavy sail on top. He also
put up a strong fence of heavy boards and planks to
protect him against man and beast. In the rock he
made a real cave, chopping away a good deal of the
stone and earth; and this he used as a store-house,
kitchen and cellar. The rest of his belongings he
placed in the tent. Of course, it took a long, long
time to do all this work.
Every day, Robinson Crusoe took his gun and
went hunting for food. Once he shot an old mother-
goat; her little kid was standing next to her and the
sound of the gun frightened the little thing so that
it could not move. He felt very sorry for the young
animal and carried it home. He petted it and
wanted to raise it, but the kid would not eat and so
he had to kill it. The flesh of the two goats supplied
him with food for a long time.
Some weeks later, Robinson Crusoe found a little
kid that was lame. He took it to his tent and looked
after it tenderly, so that by the time the leg was well,
the kid was quite tame and followed him around.
In a short time, he had caught enough goats to sup-
ply him with all the milk he needed.
Often the tears would run down Robinson Cru-
soe's face as he thought of his home and of the lonely
state in which he found himself on this unknown
island. But he took comfort in the fact that he was
better off than the poor men who had been with him
on the ship and lost their lives at sea. He made up
his mind to wait in patience for the time when a ship
would heave in sight that would take him back to
England.
Thus alone, he felt that he would soon forget all
record of time — days, weeks, months and years. He
had no books, nor pen nor ink; so he took his knife
ROBINSON CRUSOE
and made a cross out of some posts, setting this up
near the shore. The first thing he did was to cut in
with his knife, " I came on shore here on the 30th of
September, 1659." For each day, he cut a notch on
the side, making longer notches for the weeks and still
longer ones for the
months, and in this
way he could man-
age to get an idea of
the passing of time.
For companions,
Robinson Crusoe
had two cats and a
dog, which he had
brought from the
ship. The dog was
a great pet and a
true friend to him.
He was so faithful
and wise and did so
many little things
for his master, that Robinson Crusoe often wished
he had the power to speak, so they might exchange
their thoughts.
Looking through one of the boxes which had never
been opened before, Robinson Crusoe found a lot of
blank books, pens and ink. He was overjoyed at
this discovery, for he knew that with this material
(as long as the ink lasted) he could write down
everything that happened each day — even the good
and bad thoughts.
To Robinson Crusoe his book was like a good

19
friend to whom he could open his heart and tell all
that was hidden there. He began to feel that, after
all, he had cause for rejoicing and that God had been
better to him than he deserved.
He now set to work to make a chair and a small
table, which could be used for reading and writing
as well as eating. Whenever he was in need of
boards, he would cut down a tree. He also made

shelves around the sides of his tent, on which he laid
his tools and nails and other things and hung up his
guns. He soon had everything handy and neatly ar-
ranged and his tent was clean and orderly. He was
kept busy improving and enlarging his place from
time to time.
When Robinson Crusoe was through with his
day's work, he would often climb to the top of a big
hill to see if he could spy the sail of a ship. Just
as often he would return disappointed and sad at

heart. His pets seemed to understand his loneliness,
for they would lick his hands and look up at him, as
though they meant to say, "Dear master, we are. so
sorry for you. We wish we could help you."
For a whole year he
wrote daily in his book.
Then the ink gave out
and he had no way of get-
ting any more. But the
notes he had written were
a great help and comfort
to him during all his stay
on the island. Out of
the fat of goats (which
he made soft by the fire)
and a piece of old rope,
which he used for a wick, he made a sort of lamp;
this he placed into a dish of clay, which had been
hardened by the sun. When night came, he was
able to read with the aid of this light.
Rummaging through some of his bags one day,
Robinson Crusoe found some dry corn husks, which
he threw on the ground outside his tent. A few days
after, the rain set in and it rained steadily for a
month. When the wet season was over, he walked
out of his tent. Think of his surprise at seeing a
few small green stalks shooting out of the ground!
He was happy, indeed, to find, a week later, that
barley had sprung up. He also noticed young
stalks of rice growing on the sides of the rock.
One day, while he was busy in his tent, Robinson
Crusoe felt a great shock. The earth crumbled down
from the roof of the cave and from the edge of the
hill and two of his posts broke down. The fright-
ened man ran out to see what was the cause of all
this. He found the ground loose and the dirt and
stones thrown up all around. There were three
more shocks and then he realized it was due to earth-
quakes, which now and then occurred in the southern
islands.
On the sea, too, the shock must have been very se-
vere, for it threw the old ship high up on one end.
When Robinson Crusoe noticed this, he swam to the
wreck to see what he could still find. Of course,
there wasn't much that could be used, as the boat
had lain in the water so long; but from day to day,
for a whole month, he chopped away all the planks
and the boards he could cut loose and as much iron
as he could get off.
The rain had started in again and Robinson Cru-
soe became ill with chills and fever. For two weeks,
he was too sick to use his gun. He was parched with
thirst, but too weak to go out of his tent to get a
drink. He lay on his bed just thinking and think-
ing of what he should do.
In spite of all his sufferings and misfortunes, Rob-
inson Crusoe had not prayed or thought of God as
he should have done. When he saw the green corn
growing on the stalks, he never once gave thanks to
the Lord for His kindness to him.
One night, during his illness, Robinson Crusoe had
a strange dream. He saw a big black cloud in a
flame of fire; a man, as bright as a flame, came out
of the cloud, holding a spear in his hand. The earth
trembled and the air was filled with flashes of fire.
To Robinson Crusoe the man said, "Seeing all these
things have not brought thee to repentance, now thou
shalt die." He raised his spear as if he meant to
kill the sick man. Robinson Crusoe screamed out
in terror and this woke him up; but he remembered
the dream for a long time.
His mind dwelt on his dear ones at home and the
wise advice they had given him, now many years

ago; but he began to think of his sins, too. He
blamed his self-will for his troubles and his sickness.
At last he understood that God had been good to him
in saving his life and providing for him in the wilder-
ness; and now he cried out in his pain, "Lord, be
my help, for I am in great distress!"
He searched for a Bible and found it in one of the
chests. The very first words he turned to were,
"Call on me in the day of trouble and I will deliver
thee." For the first time since he was a child, Robin-
son Crusoe prayed to God for help. He prayed so
earnestly that he felt God was near and would
surely hear him. That night his mind was much
easier and his sleep more restful.
When he woke up the next morning, he felt
stronger and in better spirits. He took several doses
of a drink made of tobacco steeped in rum, which he
had heard would cure chills and fever.
As soon as Robinson Crusoe was well again, he
went to explore the island and to see what he could
find to eat. He still had the flesh of goats and
pigeons as well as the eggs of a large turtle he had
caught, but all his bread was gone and he wanted a
change of food. He went up the creek where he had
brought his rafts on shore and then walked along
farther for about two miles. He came to a small
brook, which was fresh and clear. A quantity of
tobacco grew around here and many kinds of plants.
Nearby were small hills and out the side of one of
these, a cool spring of water flowed. Lemon and
lime trees, grape vines and melons were very plenti-
ful and much of the fruit was ripe. It was such a
delightful, pretty spot, with plants and trees and
trailing vines, that Robinson Crusoe rested here for
a few days. Later he built a comfortable tent in the
midst of these charming surroundings and planted a
row of young trees in front of it. He called this
his country house and made many visits back and
forth.
When Robinson Crusoe returned to his tent, he
found everything safe. He took with him all the
ROBINSON CRUSOE
fruit he could carry and hung the grapes in the sun
to dry. In this way, as raisins, he could keep them
for a long time and enjoy their sweetness.
Looking at his post, in which he had notched his
calendar, Robinson Crusoe found he had been on
the island for a whole year. In all that time, there
was no sign of a ship or of a living soul. He read
his Bible every day and lived a quiet and contented
life.'
At meal times, Robinson Crusoe would sit at the
table with all his pets around
him—a poll parrot, which he
had caught and tamed, would
rest on the back of his chair;
his dog would lie
at his feet; his cats
nestled on each side
of him—all wait-
ing for the morsels
of food he fed to
them from his
He was thankful for
the companionship of these
little pets. In the evening, when the day's work was
over, he would sit with his little family at the door
of his tent. He taught the poll parrot to talk, and
the first time it spoke the sound of its voice fright-
ened him. You see it was such a long time since he
had heard any voice but his own.
Robinson Crusoe made some rude tools and with
these he dug up the ground and planted corn, rice
and barley, in order to raise his bread. He was not

successful with his crops the first year, as the sowing
was done too late; the second year, the hares and
goats and birds ruined them; but the third year, he
made a trap to catch the birds and set his dog to hunt
the hares and also put a hedge around the field for
protection, and that year he raised a good crop.
He wondered how he could grind his corn and bake
his bread, for he had no mill, neither had he pots nor
pans. So he got clay and sand and mixed them to-
gether, making a sort of paste. This he formed into
jars and bowls and other dishes. When they were
dry, he burned them on the fire, to make them strong
and firm. After a few experiments, he succeeded in
making all the dishes he needed.
To enable him to grind his corn, he took a big block
of hard wood and cut a deep hole. Into this he put
the grain, using a short, heavy stick to beat it out fine.
To separate the meal from the bran and the husk
(outside covering of the grain), he had to have some
kind of a sieve. He found a piece of thin cloth,
which he had brought from the ship a long time ago,
and out of this he made three small sieves.
All that Robinson Crusoe still needed to bake his
bread was a proper fire. He built a large fire, and
when the wood was all burnt to live coals, he drew
the coals out on the tiles he had placed around his
hearth. He waited until the tiles were hot before
he put the pan on, and in a short time he had a nice
loaf of bread. He also baked cakes and puddings.
Without anyone around to help him, he had to learn
a great many things by himself.
Four years passed by and still no ship appeared.
Some distance away from the island was the main-
land. Robinson Crusoe longed to go there and ex-
plore the country, but the fear of wild men kept him
away. He wanted to build a boat for himself to
sail around the island and give him a little pastime.
He cut down a large tree and, with his tools, shaped
the trunk into a boat. It took him five months of
steady work to finish it and all the time he was hew-
ing it into shape, he was thinking of the good time
he would have on the water. Unfortunately, how-
ever, when the boat was ready to be launched, it was
so big and heavy that he found it impossible to move
it. What a disappointment it was to him to be
obliged to leave it on shore!
The time had come when Robinson Crusoe must
think about his clothes. He had plenty of food and
goats and milk, but his clothes were almost in rags.
All the clothing he had brought from the wreck years
ago was now worn out. From the goats he killed, he
would save the hides and hang them in the sun to
dry. He now had a lot of skins on hand and made a
cap for his head, which turned out well; then he
made a whole suit for himself. He had nothing to
protect him from the rain or from the heat and glare
of the sun, so he made an umbrella out of a frame
covered with a skin. This he found very useful.
Another year went by. Robinson Crusoe decided
to build another boat; this time, a smaller one.
After working on it a long time, it was finished;
there was even a little cabin in which to place his
food and arms. He put on a mast and a sail, and
at one end his shade to shield him from the sun.
27
Then he took a short sail around the island, which
he enjoyed so much that he made up his mind to take
a longer cruise soon after.
One morning, Robinson Crusoe put his gun and
some food into the boat and went exploring the is-

land. He found the currents so strong, they almost
carried him out to sea. He struggled against them
for two days and thought that he and his boat
would be lost. On the fourth day, the sea was calm
again, but the wind and the tide had driven him to
the end of the island. He left his boat there and
had a long walk home. He did not venture on the
water again for almost a year.
ROBINSON CRUSOE
At the end of that time, he decided to walk
back to the place where he had left his boat. He
started off along the
shore and when he
was almost at the end
of his walk, he was
astonished to see the
print of a man's
naked foot in the
sand. Yes, there it
was, toes, heel and
sole! In the ten
years that Robinson
Crusoe spent on this
island, this was the
first sign of a human
being. He walked
up and down the
shore, but could see no one. Then he hurried back
to his country house (which was nearer) as fast as
possible. All manner of thoughts filled his head
and he was strangely frightened.
He was so uneasy he could not sleep that night
and for three days he did not go out — not until he
had to go in search of food. He looked around cau-
tiously in every direction, but still there was no sign
of man. He began to think that perhaps, after all,
it was only the impression of his own foot that he
saw.
Three or four years more passed by in the same rest-
less way. The fear of wild men prompted Robinson
Crusoe to strengthen his fence and walls around his

tent and cave, and to make his flock of goats (which
now numbered over forty) more safe. Some years
before, he had built a pen for them near his country
house.
During one of his walks, Robinson Crusoe climbed
to the top of a hill and looked out to sea. He
thought he saw a boat, but it was so far off it scarcely
seemed bigger than a speck and he could not make
out what it really was. He strolled down the hill
to a part he had not visited before and there, close
to the edge of the shore, he saw a pit in which a fire
had once been made; lying all around were skulls,
hands, feet and burnt bones of men. The sight of
this made him sick, for he knew that cannibals (or
man-eaters) had been there at one of their gruesome
feasts. He hurried back to his tent with all possible
speed and took out of the earth all the things that
grew on his farm, so as to give the place as wild an
appearance as possible. He thus hoped the wild men
would not be led to think any one lived there.
For a long time after this, Robinson Crusoe went
daily to the top of the hill to see if there were
any boats or men about. But he saw neither one nor
the other and gradually he felt more at ease. Once,
when he went into the wood to cut down some small
trees for fire-wood, he spied, for the first time, a large
hole in the back of a thick patch of low brush. From
this hole, two large, shining things like eyes seemed
to gleam at him and a cold shiver ran through him.
He walked toward the hole and heard a sound like
a moan. On coming up close, he was much relieved
to find that it was only an old goat which had crept
ROBINSON CRUSOE
in there to die. He saw the hole was the mouth of
a deep cave.
The next morning, Robinson Crusoe took six lights

with him and went to the cave. He had to creep in
on his hands and knees, for about ten feet, through
a sort of tunnel. At the end of this, he noticed the
roof rose up high and that he could stand up. And
such a wonderful sight as he now beheld! The roof
and the sides of this cave shone like brilliant jewels
—whether there were diamonds, precious stones or
gold in the rock, he did not know. He felt this cave
would afford fine shelter in case it was needed at
any time for a hiding-place. Here he brought many
of his guns and powder for safe-keeping.
Robinson Crusoe had now lived on this island
twenty-two years. He had become so accustomed
to this place and his manner of living that, but for
the thought of wild men, he was content to end his
days here.
One day, he noticed smoke coming from his side
of the island, about two miles away. He ran back
to the top of the hill and lay down flat, so he
could look around without being seen. Through
his spy glass, he saw a large fire with nine wild
men around it. Two canoes, in which they had
come, were lying on the edge of the shore, while three
more were sailing away toward the mainland. As
soon as the tide went out, the men on shore scram-
bled into their boats and they, too, were off.
When Robinson Crusoe went down to investigate,
he saw, from the bones and skulls that were left, that
these wild men must have come again on one of their
man-eating visits. He determined to kill them
when next they landed on the island.
For a long time, Robinson Crusoe did nothing on
his farm. He kept constant watch for over a year,
never using his gun for fear the sound might attract
the savages. But they did not appear and nothing
happened to cause him alarm.
One night, in the spring, a terrible storm arose and
the wind blew a regular gale. Robinson Crusoe sat
in his tent, reading his Bible. Suddenly, a gun was
fired and then another shot. He rightly thought it
was some ship in distress. He ran to the top of the
hill and built a big fire, in the hopes of signaling to
the men. In spite of the wind, the dry wood burned
freely and the people doubtless saw the blaze, but
were unable to reach the shore in such a tempest.
ROBINSON CRUSOE
In the morning, Robinson Crusoe was pained to
see that the ship had struck on the rocks near the very
current that once almost wrecked his own boat. For
the first time in years, he
got into his little boat
and sailed out to the
ship. He had no fear of
wild men then; his only
thought was to see if he
could save the lives of
any who might still be
on board. But the only
living thing in the ship
was a dog and he was al-
most starved to death.
Robinson Crusoe
gave him some
bread and a
drink from a jar
he had with him and then put the dog into his sail-
boat. He was glad to take him, for his old dog was
dead for some years.
In one of the rooms of the ship were two dead men;
the others must have drowned. There were some
large.casks of wine and rum in the hold, but they
were too big and heavy for Robinson Crusoe to lift.
He found two chests, a little cask of liquor, a fire
shovel and tongs, two brass kettles and a copper pot,
some handkerchiefs, shirts and other useful things.
All these he put into his boat and sailed back to the
island, and stored them all in his cave in the woods.
He had been gone from his tent for three days

(sleeping in his boat), but on his return, he found
everything just as he had left it. In one of the
chests were three large bags of gold, which he stored
away with the other gold he had saved.
Another two years passed without anything of im-
portance having occurred.
One morning, when Robinson Crusoe went out to
look after his boat, he spied five canoes close by and
near them were a band of black men, at least thirty
of them. He ran back to his tent and put all his
things away as safely as he could, placed his ax and
his sword into his belt and carried his gun and spy
glass in his hand. Then he walked to the top of the
hill to watch the actions of the black men. He saw
they were all dancing around a fire, in which was
some kind of meat, but he could not tell what it was.
Presently, two slaves, who were bound hand and
foot, were dragged from one of the boats. The can-
nibals untied them, letting one stand, while they
cut up the other.
When the first one found he was free, he ran away,
taking the road which led straight to Robinson Cru-
soe's tent. Three of the black men gave chase.
Robinson Crusoe hastily fetched two more guns, for
he wanted to save the poor fellow, if he could. One
of the black men had run back and the frightened
captive was now quite close to Robinson Crusoe, fol-
lowed by the other two. Crusoe hesitated firing his
gun at the savages, for fear the others would hear.
So he made a sign to the slave to come up to him; then
he shot his pursuers, killing one and wounding the
other. Believing the wounded man might still do
ROBINSON CRUSOE
him harm, the slave cut off the other's head with his
rescuer's sword. Then he buried the two bodies in
the sand.
The fire and noise of the gun terrified the slave
so that he stood as if glued to the spot. Robinson
Crusoe gave him to understand, by making signs,
that he would not hurt him. Then the slave put his

head down flat on the ground, took one of Crusoe's
feet in his hand and laid it on his own bowed head
and made him understand that he would serve him
as long as he lived. Robinson Crusoe let the black
man know that he was pleased. He took him to the
cave at the other end of the island and made him a
comfortable bed of straw, covered with a blanket, and
gave him food and drink. Then the tired slave fell
asleep.
Shortly after, while Robinson Crusoe went out to
milk the goats in the pen near the cave, the man
awoke. He came out and made many signs that he
wanted to wait upon his new master. He was a
handsome, gentle-looking fellow, with fine features
and straight black hair.
Robinson Crusoe taught him to call him master,
also to say a few words. As the man wore hardly
any clothes, Robinson Crusoe made him a goat-skin
coat and a hare-skin cap (in which he felt very un-
comfortable at first), and called him Friday, as that
was the day on which he had found him.
Friday's tribe had also been in the habit of eating
human flesh. To cure him of his taste for this, his
master knew he must give him some kind of meat.
So he taught Friday how to kill and dress game.
One day, Robinson Crusoe took his man out hunt-
ing with him. When he aimed his gun and shot a
little kid, poor Friday sank to the ground, trembling
with fright. Every time the gun went off, he had an
idea his master meant to kill him. At last, Robinson
Crusoe taught him how to handle a gun himself and
how to shoot, and in a few weeks, he could hunt with
skill.
Friday enjoyed the flesh of goats and other game
they shot on the island and made his master under-
stand he would never again eat man's flesh. This,
of course, pleased Robinson Crusoe very much.
Friday watched his master prepare their meals and
bake the bread, and in a short time, he could do all
the work himself. He also helped on the farm and
did everything most cheerfully and faithfully, for
he loved his master for all his kindness to him.
ROBINSON CRUSOE
Robinson Crusoe taught Friday to speak intelli-
gently and to understand everything that was said
to him, and he learned very quickly. His master
also taught him religion, and in doing so strength-
ened his own faith.

»K
Robinson Crusoe wondered how it came that Fri-
day was with those wild men. He asked him
whether his nation never conquered in battle.
"Yes, yes," answered Friday, "we always fight the
better."
"How came you to be taken prisoner, then, Fri-
day?"
"They more many than my nation, in the place
where me was. They take one, two, three and me;
my nation beat them in the yonder place, where me
no was; there my nation take one, two, great thou-
Robinson Crusoe and Friday Cruising around the Island.
sand," answered Friday in as good English as he had
mastered.
"But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies, then?" continued Robinson
Crusoe.
"They run one, two, three and me and make
go in the canoe. My nation have no canoe that
time," replied Friday, meaning that he and three
others had been captured and taken away in a
canoe.
"Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they carry them away and
eat them, as these did?"
"Yes," said Friday, "my nation eat mans too, eat
all up."
"Where do they carry them? " inquired Robinson
Crusoe.
"Go to other place, where they think," explained
Friday.
"Do they come here?" asked Robinson Crusoe
with interest.
"Yes, yes, they come here," said Friday. "Come
other else place."
"Have you been here with them?"
"Yes," said Friday, "I have been here "— point-
ing to the northwest side of the island, which, it
seemed, was their side, and where, indeed, his tribe
had been on Robinson Crusoe's first discovery of the
skulls and human bones.
Robinson Crusoe asked Friday many questions
about his country and the people there. Friday told
him that west of their land, there were white men
and that they had killed such men — meaning the
cruel Spaniards.
Robinson Crusoe told Friday of his own life, and
how, being cast on the island, he lived there all these
years. He also spoke about the ship. One day, he
took Friday to see the wreck. For a time, Friday
seemed to be in deep thought. Finally, he said,
"Me see such boat like come to place at my nation."
This made Robinson Crusoe think the white men
from the ship that was lost might have gone to Fri-
day's land; so he asked Friday whether there were
white men in the boat. Friday answered quickly,
"Yes, the boat full of white mans. We save the
white mans from drown." Robinson Crusoe asked
him where they were now.
"They live, they dwell at my nation," said Friday.
Then Robinson Crusoe inquired how it was that
Friday's people did not kill and eat them. Friday
said they ate no men except those who came to fight
them.
One day, when they were on the top of a cer-
tain hill, Friday cried out in excitement, "Oh,
joy! Oh, glad! There see my country! There
my nation!"
Robinson Crusoe asked him whether he wished to
return to his own land.
"Yes, I be much O glad to be at my own nation,"
answered Friday.
"What would you do there? Would you turn
wild again and eat man's flesh?"
Shaking his head, Friday said, "No! No! Fri-
day tell them to live good, tell them to pray God,
tell them to eat corn bread, cattle flesh, milk. No
eat man again."
Robinson Crusoe said he thought Friday's people
would kill him; but Friday told his master that they
would do him (Friday) no harm, for they would love

to learn. Then Robinson Crusoe asked him whether
he would go back to them; Friday answered that he
would return to his people only if his master went
with him.
"Why," said Robinson Crusoe, "they will eat me
if I come there."
"No, no," said Friday. "Me make they no eat
you; me make they much love you."
Friday said their boat was too small to sail so far.
When Robinson Crusoe promised to make him a big
boat, which would bring him home to his tribe, Fri-
day looked up at his master in a sad, affectionate
way, and said:
"Why you angry, mad with Friday? What me
done? Why send Friday home away to my na-
tion?"
"Why, Friday, did not you say you wished you
were there?" asked Robinson Crusoe.
"Yes, yes," answered the loyal fellow, "wish we
both there."
"What shall I do there?" said Robinson Crusoe.
"You teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans;
you tell them know God, pray God, live new life;
you teachee me good, you teachee them good."
Robinson Crusoe's heart was touched by this proof
of Friday's faith and love. He saw the truth of
what the black man said and made up his mind that
whenever Friday went back to his people, he would
go with him.
They both set to work building a large boat out of
a tree they had cut down. When it was finished,
they fitted it with sails and only waited until the
rainy season was over to sail away. Robinson Cru-
soe had now spent twenty-six years on the island and
had Friday with him three years.
Friday went to the shore one day to hunt for some
large turtles, which his master thought would be nice
to take along on their trip. He had been gone but a
little while, when he came running back to Robinson
Crusoe, trembling with fear and crying, " O, master!
O, master! O, sorrow! O, bad!" Friday spoke of
three boats he had seen near the shore and thought
the wild men had come to take him. Robinson Cru-
soe tried to calm him and said that together they
would get rid of those bad men, if Friday did just
as he was told. The faithful servant answered that
he was ready to die, if his master bade him.
Coming up to the side of the hill, they saw the
three boats and about twenty savages, carrying with
them three men bound hand and foot. These they
intended to eat. When Robinson Crusoe reached
the edge of the wood (near where the men were),
Friday following quietly at his heels, he told his man
to go behind a large tree, look around and bring him
word of what he saw. Friday soon returned and re-
ported that the men had made a fire, that one of the
captives had been killed and that another, a white
man, lay bound nearby.
Thereupon, Robinson Crusoe and Friday fired their
guns again and again and those of the wild men who
were not hit ran in all directions, yelling out in
fright. As a few rushed to their canoes, Friday shot
at them again, and they all seemed to fall in a heap
in the boat; two of them, however, soon sat up again.
Robinson Crusoe went to the poor white man, who
was a Spaniard, and cut away his bonds. He was so
weak, he could hardly speak. Robinson Crusoe gave
him a drink from his flask, which revived him a little,
and handed him a sword and pistol for protection,
with which he killed four of the savages. Out of
the band of twenty, only four made their escape.
Robinson Crusoe now went to look after the poor
fellow who lay bound in a canoe the cannibals had
left behind, in their hurry to get away. As he freed
the man's arms and feet, Friday came up to them.
His master asked him to give the suffering man a
drink of rum. This made him feel stronger, and he
sat up in the boat and spoke to Robinson Crusoe.
When Friday heard the man's voice and looked into
his face, he took him in his arms and embraced him.
For a long time, Friday could not speak, only wring
his hands in pain and beat his face and head in anger.
At last, when his manner became more quiet, Friday
told Robinson Crusoe that the man was his father.
The two captives were now free and Robinson Cru-
soe's only thought was to get them to his tent. He
gave them some food he had with him, while Friday
darted back to the tent as swift as a deer and brought
back a jug of refreshing spring water, of which all
in turn took a drink.
The men were too weak to walk to the tent, so Fri-
day helped them into the canoe and rowed them back
to the creek landing; then he went back for the other
boat. He and his master carried the two men to the
shore and left them there, until they hastily con-
structed a tent and made two soft beds of straw, cov-
ered with blankets. Friday then returned for the
guns and other things that had been left behind,
while Robinson Crusoe busied himself with cooking
a young kid and making a dish of good broth for the
men.
The next morning, Robinson Crusoe had a long
talk with them. The white man, whom he gave the
name of Frank, told him he had come from Spain,
that he, with others, had been on the ship that was
wrecked and that they sailed in the small boat to
the mainland. There they found only wild men,
but lived peaceably among them. They could not
get away, as they had no tools to make a boat and
were in a sad state because they had no guns or means
of getting food. Frank said if they would all go
to the place he came from, the other white men there
would be happy to come back with Robinson Crusoe
and serve him, but that it was wise to wait until they
had a sufficient supply of food, for there were sixteen
men in the party.
So Robinson Crusoe and the other three men
worked on the farm for many months, and as a result,
raised a much larger crop. When he felt he had
enough food for them all, he sent Frank and Jack
(Jack was the name given to Friday's father) out
in a boat to bring the other white men back with
them to the island.
The two men had been gone about eight days,
when, one morning, Friday ran up to his master, call-
ing excitedly, "Master, master! They are come!
They are come!" Robinson Crusoe went out to
meet them. To his astonishment, however, it was an
English ship he saw. He watched the men on deck
launch a long boat, into which they had put three
men who were bound. Five others then jumped
aboard and headed for the shore.
They all got off the boat. Robinson Crusoe no-
ticed one of the men raised his sword as if to strike
at one of the captives, who hung his head and seemed
to be begging for his life. The same thing happened
with the other two men who were bound. Then they
were set free.
The three men went off and sat under the shade of
a tree, out of sight of the rest, while some of the
other men went strolling around the island. When
these returned to the shore, intending to sail away,
the tide was so low they could not get the boat off
the sand; so, of course, they had to wait.
Robinson Crusoe walked back to his tent, took all
the arms Friday and he could use and returned to
the three men sitting on the ground. He asked who
they were and why they were here. One of the men
spoke: "I was commander of that ship; my men
have mutinied against me; they have been hardly pre-
vailed on not to murder me, and at last have set me
on shore in this desolate place, with these two men
with me (one my mate, the other a passenger), where
we expected to perish."
Robinson Crusoe inquired whether they had any
firearms and the man said they had two guns, one
of which was left in the boat. "Well, then," said
Robinson Crusoe, "leave the rest to me. I see they
are asleep. It is an easy thing to kill them all. But
shall we not rather take them prisoners?" After
speaking further with the man, Robinson Crusoe felt
he could trust him and his companions and gave
each of them a gun.
They walked toward the other men. Two of the
band were the leaders of the mutiny and bad char-
acters, and these only the captain said should be
killed. The others were awake by this time and
begged for mercy, promising to be faithful to the
captain, to look after the boat and sail back with
him. So only the two bad fellows were shot. Robin-
son Crusoe and his men bound the others hand and
foot and took them up to his place, putting them in
a safe spot. The commander and his two compan-
ions went to the tent with their rescuers, where they
all enjoyed a good meal and sat down to talk and
rest.
They knew that the other members of the crew
(there were twenty-six men still on the ship) would
soon come to look for their comrades. So Robinson
Crusoe and his men made a large hole in the boat in
which the crew came and drew it up on the sand.
Sure enough, while they were in the tent, they
heard a gun fired! It came from the ship and was
a sign for the crew to return. But when the men on
deck saw that the boat did not move, they immedi-
ately sent out a small boat with ten men, who were
supplied with guns. They reached the shore just
where the first boat lay, and seeing no one around,
some of them walked up and down, yelling loudly
to attract the attention of their friends. As none of
them appeared, however, all came ashore but three,
who stayed behind to watch the boat. The others
walked to the south side of the island and talked
over what to do.
When they returned, Robinson Crusoe sent Friday
and the mate down a short way and told them to call
to the men, who were getting ready to sail away. In
a little while, three of them came up close to Robin-
son Crusoe and at a sign from him, Friday and the
mate fired at them and killed two that were bad men.
The mate told the others of the crew to lay down
their arms and yield or they would all be dead
men.
"To whom must we yield? Where are they?"
asked one of the crew.
ROBINSON CRUSOE
"Here's our captain and fifty men with him have
been hunting you these two hours," answered the
mate. (He said this just to frighten them.)
They laid down their arms and they, too, were
bound. Friday and the mate brought them to the
cave, where Friday kept watch all night and where

they had to stay a few days. He looked after them
and gave them food and drink.
The mate and some of the other men who could be
trusted went back to the ship. They soon brought
the other mutineers to terms, and before long all
were willing again to obey their commander. Then
they steered the ship to the shore. The captain
came up to Robinson Crusoe, who was standing on
the hilltop, and embracing him, said:
"My dear friend and deliverer, there's your ship,
for she is all yours, and so are we and all that belong
to her."
Robinson Crusoe was so overcome at the sudden
news, he sank to the ground, weeping for joy. There
was the ship he had longed for so many, many years,
right before his eyes! He embraced his new friend
and told him he would go with him, for he felt that
God had sent the captain to him. He knelt down to
give praise and thanks to the Lord for the many kind-
nesses bestowed on him.
The captain gave Robinson Crusoe a suit of clothes
and brought many good things to eat. Then they
went back to the cave where the men were bound.
Robinson Crusoe told them he had come from the
Governor of the island, who promised to give them
their freedom if they agreed to stay there and work
the land; that if they went home on the ship, they
would be hanged when they reached England.
They all declared their willingness to stay and live
peaceably together. Then Robinson Crusoe set
them free and told them how they might live com-
fortably and securely. He also spoke to them about
the Spaniards who were coming, for whom he left a
letter.
The next day, he took Friday, one of his poll par-
rots, his goat-skin cap and umbrella, together with
all the gold he had stored away so long, and went
on board the ship.
After having spent twenty-eight years on the
ROBINSON CRUSOE
island, Robinson Crusoe set sail for home on the 19th
of December, 1686, and arrived in England on the
1 ith day of June, 1687.
