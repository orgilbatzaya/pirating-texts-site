LIFE

Adventures
O F
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
1[ WAS born in the year 1632; in the city of
A York; of a good family, though not of that
country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen^
who fettled first at Hull. He got a good estate
by mercharidize,* and leaving off his trade* lived
afterwards at York, from whence he had^married
my mother, whose relations were named Robinson,
& very good family in that country* and from
whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but by
xou u B the
the usual corruption of words in England, we ate
now called, nay we call ourselves, and write our'
name Crusoe* and so my companions always
called me,
I had two elder brothers, one of wham was
Lieutenant Colonel to an English regiment of
foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the
famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the
battle near Dunkirk, against the Spaniards*
What became of my second brother, I never
knew, any more than my father and mother did
<vhat was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred
to any trade, my head began to be filled very
early with rambling thoughts; my father, who
was very ancient, had given me a- competent
share of learning, as far as house education and a
country free-school generally go, and designed
- me for the law; but I would be satisfied with no-
thing but going to sea, and my inclination to
this led me so strongly against the will, nay.the
commands of my father,* and against all th,e en-*
treaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal
in that propenfton of nature, tending directly to
that life of misery which was to befal me.
1 My
3
My father, a wife and grave man, gave me se-
rious and excellent counsel against what he fore-
saw was my design* He called me one morning
into his chamber* where he was confined by-the
gout> and expostulated very warmly with me
upon this subject; he asked me what reasons,
more than a mere wandering inclination, I had
for leaving his house, and my native coun-
try, where I might be well introduced, and
had a prospect: of railing my fortune by applica-
tion and industry, with a life of ease and plea-
sure. He told me it was for men of desperate
fortunes on one hand* or of aspiring superior for-
tunes on the other, who went abroad upon ad-
A^entures, to rife by enterprise, and make them-
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of
the common road; that these things were all ei-
ther too far above me, Or too far below me; that
mine was the middle state, or what might be
called the upper station of low life, which he had
found, by long experience* was the best state in
thev WorM; the most suited to human happiness,
not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the
labour' and sufferings of the mechanic part of
mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride,
luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of
.mankind; he told me, I might judge of the hap-
piness of this state-by 'One thing, viz. That
this was the state of life which all other people
B z envied;
4'
ADVENTURES OF
envied; that kings have frequently lamented thtf
miserable consequences of being born to great
things, and wished they had been placed in the'
middle of the two extremes, between the meat*
and the great; that the wife man gave his testi-
mony to this, as the just standard of true felicity,
when he prayed to have neither poverty nor
riches.
He bid me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the
upper and lower part of mankind, but that, the
middle station had the fewest disasters, and was
not exposed to s6 many vicissitudes as the higher
or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not
subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses
either of body or mind, as those were, who, by
vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies, on;
one hand, or by hard labour, want of ,necessariesy
and mean and insufficient diet on the other hand,
bring distempers upon themselves by the natural
consequences of their way of living; that the
middle station of life was calculated for all kind
of virtues, and all kind of enjoyments; that,
peace and plenty were the handmaids of a mid-*
die fortune; that temperance, moderation,.quiets
ness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and:
all desirable pleasures, were the blessings at-
tending the middle station of life; that this war-
mer*
men went silently and smoothly thro' the world,
and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with
the labours of the hands, dr of the head, not fold
to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harrassed
with perplexed circumstances, which rob the
foul of peace, and the body of rest; not enraged
with the passion of envy, or secret burning lust
of ambition for great things; but in easy cir-
cumstances, sliding gently through the world,
and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without
the bitter, feeling that they are happy, and learn-
ing, by every day's experience, to know it more
sensibly. % /'
After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the
most affectionate manner, not to play the young
man* hor to precipitate myself into miseries
which nature and the station of life I was born
in, seemed to have provided against; that I was
under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he
would do well for me, and endeavour to enter
me fairly into the station of life which he had
been just recommending tor me ;7 and that if I
was not very easy and happy in the world, it must
be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it, and
that helhould have nothing to answer for, having
thus discharged his duty in warning me against
measures which he knew would be to my hurt,
Jn a word, that as he would do very kind things

ADVENTURES OF
for me, if I would stay and fettle at home, as he
directed, so he would not have so much hand in
rriy misfortunes, as to give me any encourage-
ment to go away; and to close all, he told me I
had my elder brother for an example, to whom
he had used the fame earnest persuasions to keep
him from going into the low country wars,, but
could not prevail, his young desires prompting
him to run into the army, where he was killed;
and though he said he would not ce^fe to pray
for me, yet he would venture to fay to me, that if
I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect
upon having neglected his counsel, when there
might be none to aflist in my recovery,
. I observed in this last part of his discourse,
which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my
father did not know it to be so himself; I say,
I observed the tears run down his face very plen-
tifully, and especially when he spoke of my bro-
ther who was killed; and that when he spoke of
my having leisure .to repent, and none to assist
me, he was so moved that he broke off the dis-
course, and told ipfc his heart was so full he could
fay no more to me.
, I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as
indeed who could be otherwise? and I resolved
, not
7
not to think of going abroad any more, but to
settle at home, according to my father's desire.
But, alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in
lhort, to prevent any of my father's further im-
portunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run
quite away from him. However, I did not act
so hastily neither, as my first heat of resolution
prompted, but I took my mother, at a time when
I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary,
and told her, that my thoughts were so entirely
bent upon seeing the world, that I should never
settle to any thing with resolution enough to go
through with it, and my father had better give
me his consent than force me to go without it:
that I was now eighteen years old, which was too
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an
attorney; that I was sure if I did, I sliould never
serve out my time, and I sliould certainly run
away from my master before my time was out,
and go to sea; and if slie would speak to my
father to let me make but one voyage abroad^ if
I came home again, and did not like it, I would
go no more; and I would promise, by a double
diligence, to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great paflion; slie
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to
speak to my father upon any such subject; /that
he knew too well what was my' interest to give
B 4 his
\
his consent to any thing so much for my hurt^
and that slie wondered how I could think of any
such thing, after such a discourse as I had with
my father, and such kind ancl tender expressions*
as she knew my father had used to me; and that,
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help
for me, but I might depend I Ihould never have
their consent to it: that, for hejr part, {he woul4
not have so much hand in my destruction; and J
sliould never have it to say, C6 that my mother
was willing when my father was not/'
Though my mother refused to, move it to my
father, yet, as I have heard afterwards she re-
ported all the discourse to him; and that my fa-
ther, after stiewing a great concern at it, said tq
her with a sigh, "That boy might be happy, if
"he would stay at home ; but, if he goes abroad^
<{ he will be the most miserable wretch that; eyeif
"was born; I can give, no consent to it/*
It was not till almost a year after this that I
broke loose, though during that time I continued
obstinately deaf to all proposals .of settling to}
business; a^id frequently expostulating with my
father and mother about thei^ beuig so positively
determined againfl: what they knew my incline
tions prompted me tb. But, being one day at
Hull, where I. weitf casually a,ndr without any
purpose
purpose of makipg an elopement at that time;
^nd one of my companions, about going to
London by sea in Jiis father's sliip, he prompts
ed me to go with him, and the common al-
lurement of seafaring ri^en, viz. 66 that it
fc lhould cost me nothing for my passage"; I con-
sulted neither father nor mother any more, nor
so much as sent them word of it; but leaving
them to hear of it; as they might, without asking
God's blessing, or my father's, without any con-
sideration of qrcymstances or consequences, an4
\i\ an ill }}pur, Gpd knows,
On the jst qf September, 1651, I went on
bpard a fjaip bound for London; never any young
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began earlier,
or continued longer than mine. The ship was
po sooner gotten out of the Humber, but the
winci begai) to blpw, apd the waves to rife in a
most frightful manner; and as I had never been
at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in
body, and terrified in my mind: I began now
seriously to reflect upon what I had done,
and how justly I was overtaken by th$ judge-
ment of* Heaven, for leaving my father's
house, and ^bando$ing my duty. All the goqd
Counsel, of my parents^ my father's tears, and my
mother's intreaties, came now frefli in, my mind;
^nd my conscience, which was not yet come to
the
the pitch of hardness to which it has been since,
reproached me with the contempt of advice, and -
the breach of my duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea, .
which I had never been upon before, went very
high, though nothing like what I have seen ma-
ny times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after.
But it wras enough to affect me then, who was
but a young sailor, and had never known any
thing of the matter. I expected every wave
would have swallowed us up, and that every time
the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough or
hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and
in this agony of mind I made many vows and
resolutions, that if it would please God to
spare my life this voyage, if ever I got once
my foot upon dry land again, I would go di~
rectly home to my father, and never set it into a
ship again while I lived; that I would take his
advice, and never run myself into such miseries
as these any more. Now I saw plainly the good-
ness of his observations about the middle station
of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived
all his days, and never had been exposed to tem-
pests at sea, or troubles on stiore: and I resolved
that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go
home to my father.
These
These wise- and sober thoughts continued
during the storm, and indeed sometime after;
but the next day, as the wind was abated, and
the sea calmer, I began to be a little inured
to it. However, I was very grave that day,
being also a little sea-sick still; but towards
night the weather cleared up, the wind was'
quite over, and a charming fine evening followed:'
the fun went down perfectly clear, and rose so
the next morning; and having little or no wind
and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the
fight was, as I thought, the most delightful that
I ever saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no:
more sea-sick, but very chearful, looking with
wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terri-
ble the day before, and could be so calm and
pleasant in a little time after. And now, lest
my good resolutions should continue, my compa-
nion, who had indeed enticed me away, came to
me, and said, " Well, Bob/' clapping me on the
shoulder, " how do you do after it? I warrant
"you were frighted, wa'nt you, last night,
tc when it blew but a cap full of wind?" "A
"cap full, d'you call it?" said I. 'Twas a ter-
u rible storm." <c A storm, you fool," replies
he, " do you call that a storm? Why, it was no-
's thing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-
"room,
Ci room, and we think nothing of .such a squall
iC of wind as that: you are but a freshwater
€i sailor, Bob; come, let us make a bowl of
4* punch, and we'll forget all that. D'ye fee
"what charming weather 'tis now?" To make
short this fad part of my story, we went the old
way of all sailors; the punch was made, and I
was made drunk with it, and in that one night's
wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my
reflections upon my past conduct, and all my re-
solutions for my future. In a word, as the sea.
was returned to its smoothness of surface and
settled calmness, by the abatement of that storm,,
so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears
and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the
sea being forgotten, ajid the cyrrent of my for-
mer desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows
and promises that I made in rny distress, I founds
indeed, some intervals of reflection, and seri-
ous thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return
#gain sometimes, but I shook them off, and roused
myself from them, as it were from a distemper,,
and applying myself to' drink and company,
spon mastered the return of those fits,, for so I
called them, and I had hrfive or #x days got as
complete a victory over Conscience as any young
fellow, that resolved not, to be troubled with it*,
could desire. But I was to have another trial for
it still; and Providence, as in such cases ge*
perally
ROBItfSOtf CRtfSfcE.
fcerally It does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse i for if I would not take this for
a deliverance, the next was to be such a one aa
the worst and most hardened wretch among us
would confess both the danger and the mercy-
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into
Yarmouth roads; the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little
way since the storm. Here we were obliged to
cpme to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind
continuing contrary, viz* at south-west, for seven
or eight days, during which time a great many,
ships from Newcastle came into the fame roads,
as the common harbour wliere the strips might wait
for a wind in the river. We had not, however,
fid here long, and should have tided up the river,
but that the wind blew too frefli; and after we
had lain four or five days, blew very hard. How-
ever, the roads, being reckoned as good as a har-
bour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle
very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not
in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent
the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of
the sea \ however the eighth day in the morning,
the wind increased, and we had all hands at work
to strike our topmasts, and make every thing
snug and close, that the strip might ride as easy
as possible. By noon the sea went very high in-
deed, and our ship rid forecastle in, stripped se-
veral
Veral seas, and we thought once or twice dtff
anchor tad come home; upon which our master
ordered out the iheet-anchor, so that we rode
with two anchors a-head, and the cables veered
out to the better end,
. By this time it blew a terrible storm irideed,
and now I began to.fee terror and amazement in
the faces of even the seamen themselves- The
master, though vigilant to the business of pre-
serving the sliip, yet, as he went in and out of his
Cabin by me, I dould hear him softly to himself
say, several times, "Lord, be merciful to us, we1
"stall be all lost; we shall be all Undone," and
the like. During these first hurries I was stupid,
lying still, in my cabin> which was in the steer-
age, and cansiot describe my temper. I could ilf
re-assume the first penitence, which 1 had so ap-
parently trampled upon, and hardened myself
against; I thought that the bitterness of death
had been past, and that this' would be nothing
too, like the first: but when the master himself
came by me, as I said just now, and said we
sliould be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted. I
got u„p out of my cabin and looked' out, but
such a dismal sight I never saw; the sea went
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or
four minutes. When I could look about, I could
fee nothing but distress round us; two Ihips, that
rid
tid near us, we found had cut their masts by the
board, being deep loaden, and our men cried out^
that a ship which rid about a mile a-head of us
was.foundered* Two more ships, being driven
from their anchors, were run out of the roads to
sea at all adventures, and that with not a mast
standing* The light ships fared the best, as not
so much labouring in the sea; but two or three
of them drove and came close by us, running
away with only their sprit-fail out before the
wind* Toward evening the mate and boatswain,
begged the master of our ship to let them out
away the foremast, which he was very loth to do;
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he
did not-, the ship would founder, he consented,
and when they had cut away the foremast, the
mainmast stood so loose, and shook the ship so
much, they were obliged to cut it away also, and
make a clear deck*
Any one may judge what a condition I must be
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and.
Who had been in such a fright before, at but a
little. But if I can express at this distance the
thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in
tenfold more horror of mind, upon account of
my former convictions, and the having returned
from them, to the resolutions I had wickedly
taken at first, than I was at death itself; and
these
l6 ADVENT VR IS O £
these, added to the terror of the storm, put m6;
into such a condition, that I can by no words
describe it. But the worst was ndt comd yet; the
storm continued with such fury, that the seamen
themselves acknowledged they had never known
a worse* We had a good lhip, but she was deep
loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the sea-
men every noW and then cried out, lh6 would
founder.. It was my advantage in one respects
that I did not know what they meant by " fdun-»-
u der," till I enquired. However, the storm
was so violent, that I saw, wh&t is not ofteir
seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others/
more sensible than the rest, at theif prayers, and
expecting every moment the ship would gc*
to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and1
under all the rest of our distresses, one df the men'
that had been down on purpose to see, cried out/
€c we had sprung a leak another said, "there:
€C was four foot water in the hold." Then all
hands were called to the pump* At that very
word, my heart, as I thought, died within mfef
4hd I fell backwards upon the side of my' bed
where I fat in the cabbin. However, the mid
touscd me, and told me, €c that I, who was able'
to do nothing before, was as well able to pump?
"as another/' at which I stirred up> and went to'
the pump and worked very heartily. While this
'Was doing, the master seeihg some light colliers,-1
who
Who not able to ride out the storm, were obliged
to slip and run away to sea, and wouldnotcome near
iis, Ordered us to fire a gun as a signal of distress.
I who knew nothing what that meant; was so
surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, or
some dreadful thing had happened; In a word,
I was so surprised; that I fell down in a swoon.
As this was i time when every body had his own
life to think of; no body minded me, of what
Was becoihe of me; but another man stept up to
the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot,
let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was
a great while before I came to myself;
We Worked on, but the Water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would foun^
der; and though the storm began to abate a lit-
tle; yet as it was not possible stle could swim till
We might run intb a pbrt, so the master conti-
nued firing guns for Help; arid a light ship who
> had rid it but justa-head of us, ventured a boat
but to help us; It was with the utmost hazard
the boat came near us; but it was impossible for
us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near th6
Ihip's side; till at last the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their liveS to savfc burs,
bur men cast them a rope over the sterri with a
buoy to it, and then vfcered it but a great length,
which they, after great labtiiir and hazard, took
C hold
hold of, and we haled them close under our stern,
and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose
.for them us, after we were in the boat, to
think of reaching their own ship; so all agreed
to let her drive, and only to pull.her in towards
sliore as much as we could; and our master pro-
mised them, that if the boat wa$ staved upon
fhore^ he would make it good to their master;
so partly^rowing, aii4 partly djriyir^g our boa,t, we
.went away to the northward, sloping towards
the stipre almost as far, as Winterton-Ness*
We were not much mqre than a quarter of.an
hour out of our sliip, but we saw her sink, and
then I understood, for the first time, what was
ineant by a ship foundering in the sea: I must
acknowledge, I had hardly eyes to look up whea
the seamen told me, "flie was( finking for,
from that moment, they, rather pyt me;into the
boat than that I might be said to go in. My
heart was ask were dead withia.me, partly with,
fright, partly with horror of mind, and th$
thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the .men yet
labouring at the. oar to bring the boat near the
sliore, We .could fee (whpn our boat mounting
the wayes we /were able to fee the sliore) a great
many people running along the sliore, tQ assist, us

thought fit.

this, nor will I urge, that it is a secret over-
ruling decree that hurries us on to be the instru-

before us, and that we rusli upon it with our eyes
open. Certainly nothing but such decreed, un-
avoidable misery attending, and which it was im-
possible forme to escape, could have pushed me
forward against the calm reasonings and persua-
sions of my most retired thoughts, and against two
such visible instructions as I had met with in my
first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me
before, and who was the master's son, was now
less forward than I; the first time he spoke to me
after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till
two or three days, for we were separated in the
town to several quarters; I fay, and the first time
he saw me it appeared his tone was altered, and
looking very melancholy, and shaking his head,
aiked me how I did; telling his father who I was,
and how I had come this voyage only for a trial*
in order to go farther abroad; his father turning,
to me, with a very grave and concerned tone,

"list. Perhaps this is all befallen us on your
"account; like Jonah in the ship of Tarfhisti/-
66 Pray/' continues he, "what are you,, and,on
*6 what account did you go to sea?" Upon that,
I told him sortie of my story, at the end -of which.,
he burst out with a strange kind of passion,
"What have I done," said he, "that such an

ADVENTURES OF
London by land ; and there, as well as on the
road, had many struggles with myself, what
course of life I should take, and whether I stiould
go home^ or go to sea. As to going home,
shame opposed the best motions that offered tq
my thoughts; and it immediately occured to me,
how I should be laughed at among the neigh-
bours; and should be ashamed to fee, not my
father and mother only, but even every body
else; from whence I have since often observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common tern?
per of mankind is, especially of youth, to that
reason which ought to guide them in such cases,
viz. that they are not astiamed to sin, and
yet are alhamed to-repent; not ashamed of the
action, for which they ought justly to be
esteemed fool?, but are ashamed of the return-
ing, which only can make therji be esteemed
wife men.
In this state of life, however, I remaned some
time, uncertain what measure to take, and what
course of life to lead, &n irresistable reluctance
continued to go home; and as I stayed a while,
the remembrance of the distress I had been in
wore off; and as that abated? the little motion I
had in my desires to a return, wore off with it?
till at'last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it^
and looked out for a voyage. That evil influ-
ence
cnce which carried me first away from my father's
house, that hurried me into the wild and indi-
gested notion of raising my fortune; and that im-
prest those conceits so forcibly upon me, as tb
make me deaf to all good advice, and to the en-
treaties, and even command of my father: I fay;
the fame influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprizes to my
view; and I went on board a vessel bound to the
coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it,
a voyage to Guinea*
It was my great misfortune, that in all these
adventures, I did not ship myself as a sailor,
whereby, though I might indeed, have worked
a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same'
time, I had learned the duty and office of at fore-
mast-many and in time^ might have qualified
myself for a mate, or lieutenant, if not for amias-
ter: But as it was always my fate to chooft for
the wofse, so I did here; for having money in"
my pocket, and good cloaths upon my back, I
would always go on board in the hai>it of a gen-
tleman; and so I neither had any business in the
lhip,- or learned to do any. It was njiy lot first of
all;, to'fall into pretty good company in London,
which does nbt always happen to such loose and
wn^uided young fellows as'I then was; the devil
generally, not orjiitting to lay some snare for them

very early. But it was not so with me, I first fell
acquainted with the master pf a stiip, whp ha4
been on the coast of Guinea, and who having had
very good success there, was resolved to go
again ; and who taking a fancy to my conversa-
tion, which was not at all disagreeable at that
time, hearing me say, "I had a mind to see the
66 world," told me, « If I would go the voyage
<c with him, I sliould be at no expence: I sliould
V* be his mess-mate and his companion, and if I
€C. could carry any thing with me, I ihould have
C( all the advantage of it that the trade would ad-

"encouragement." I embraced the offer, and
entering into a strict friendship with this captain^
;who was an honest and plain-dealing man. I
* went the voyage with him, and carried a small
adventure with me, which by the disinterested
honesty of my friend the captain, I encreased

. which I may fay, was successful in all my'adven- .
tures, and which I owe- to the integrity and ho-
nesty of my.ffieod the captain,, under .whom also,
I got
I got a competent knowledge of the mathema-
tics and the rules of navigation, learned how to
fceep an account of the ship's course, take an ob«
servation, and, in short, to understand some things
that were needful to be understood by a sailor;
for as he took delight to introduce me, I took de-
light to learn, and, in a word, this voyage made
me both a sailor and a merchant, for I brought
home 51b. 9Z. of gold dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London at my return almost
30ol.and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin. Yet
even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too,
particularly, that I was continually sick, being
thrown intp a violent calenture by the excessive
heat of the climate; our principal trading being
\ipon the coast, from the latitude of 15 degrees
north, even to the line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying foen after
tiis arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage
again, apd I embarked in the same vessel with one
who was his mate in the former voyage, and had
npw got the command of the ship. This was
the* unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for
fhough I did not carry quite iool. of my new-
gained wealth, so that I had aooh left, arid which
i lodged mth my friend's widow, who was very

ADVENTURES OF
just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes hi
this voyage, and the first was this, viz. Our slup
making her course towards the Canary Islands,
or rather between those islands and the African
ihore, was surprized in the grey of the morning4
by a Turkisli rover, jof Sailee, who gave chace1"
to us, with all the fail she could make. We'
crouded also as much canvas as our yards would
spreads or our masts carry, to have got clear; but
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would
certainly come up with us in a few hours, We pre-
pared to sight, our ship having 12 guns, and the
rogue 18. About three in the afternoon he came*
up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, jjast
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our sterny
as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to
bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon*
him, which made him slieer off again, after re-
turning our fire, and pouring in also his small lhot
from near doo men which he had on board.
However, we had not a man touched, all our men
keeping close. He prepared to attack us* again^
and we to defend ourselves; but laying us on
board the next time upon our other quarter, he*
entered 60 men upon our decks, who immediately1
fell to cutting and hacking the fails and? rigging.
We plyed them with small stiot, half-pikes, pow-
der-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of
them twice. However, to cut sliort this!.melan-
choly
choiy part of our story, our ihip being disabled,
aud three of our .men'killed, and eight wounded,
we were obliged to yield, and were carried aE
prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the
jVfaors,
The usage J had there was not so dreadful as
at first I apprehended, nor was I carried up the
.country to the emperor's court, as the rest of our
men were, but was kept by the captain of the
rover as his proper prize, and made his stave-,
being young and nimble, and fit for his business.
At this surprizing change of my circumstances,
from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was per~
fectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back up^
on my fathers prophetic discourse to me, u that
,ff I slxould be miserable, and have none to relieve
<c me which I thought was now so effectually
brought to pass, that it could not be worse; that
now the hand of heaven had overtaken me, and
I was undone without redemption. But alas!
this was but a taste of the misery I was to go
through as will appear in the, sequel of this story.
As my new patron, or master, had taken me
home to his house, so I was in hopes that he
would take me with him when he went to sea
again, believing that it would some time or
pther be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Por-
tugal
hold of, and we haled them close under our stern,
and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose
.for them pr us, after we were in the boat, to
think of reaching their own ship; so all agreed
to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
stiore as much as we could; and our master pro-
mised them, that if the boat was, staved upon
sliore, he would make it good tp their master;
so partly rowing, and partly driving our boat, we
/went away to the northward, sloping towards
the stiore almost as far as Winterton-Ness,
We were not much more than a quarter of an
hour out of our sliip, but we saw her sink, and
then I understood, for the first time, what was
meant by a ship foundering in the sea: I must
acknowledge, I had hardly eyes to loot up when
the seamen toj.d me, "flie was finking for,
from that moment, they rather, pyt m^e into the
boat than that I might be said to go in. My
heart was as .it were dead within me, partly with,
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the
thoughts of what was yet before me*
While we were in this condition, the .men yet
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the
sliore, we could fee (when our boat mounting
the waves we .were able to fee the shore) a great
many people running along the shore, tQ assist us
4 when
Wkeft we stibuld come hear, but we made but
slow way towards the sliore> nor were we able to
reach the shore, till being past the light-house at
Wintertori, the ihore falls off to the westward
tcSWafd^Cromer; and'so the land broke off a lit-
tle, the violence of the; wind": here we got in,
and, though not without much difficulty, got all
safe on 'iiiore, arid walked afterwards on foot to
Yarmouth; where, as unfortunate men, we were
used with great humanity^ as well by the magi-
strates of the town, who assigned us good quar-
ters, as by particular merchants-and owners of
ihips; and had rrioney given us sufficient to car-
ry u& either to London, or back to Hull, as we
thought fit.
Had I now had the fense to have gone back to
HUM, arid have gb'ne home, I had been happy*
and my father, an ernblem of our blessed Saviour's
parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for
hearing the ship I went away in, was cast away
iri Yarmouth Roads; it was a great while before
he had any assurance that I was not drowned.
Bits my ill fate pushed riie on now ivith an ob-
stinacy that nothing could resist ; and though t
had several times loud calls from my reason, knd
my more composed* judgmeiit, to go home, yet
I had no'power to do it. I know not what to call
C ?> this,
this, nor will I urge, that it is a secret over-
ruling decree that hurries us on to be the instru-
ments of our own destruction, even though it be
before us, and that we ru(h upon it with our eyes
open. Certainly nothing but such decreed, un-
avoidable misery attending, and which it was im-
possible for me to escape, could have pushed me
forward against the calm reasonings and persua-
sions of my most retired thoughts, and against two
such visible instructions as I had met with in my
first attempt*
My comrade, who had helped to harden me
before, and who was the master's son, was now
less forward than I; the first time he spoke to me
after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till
two or three days, for we were separated in the
town to several quarters; I fay, and the first time
he saw me it appeared his tone was altered, and
looking very melancholy, arid shaking his head,
alked me how I did; telling his father who I was,
and how I had come this voyage only for a trial*
* in order to go farther abroad; his father turning,
tome, with a very grave and concerned tone,
"Young man," fays he, « you ought never to
"*< go to sea any more, you ought to take this
« for a plain and visible token, that you are not
"to be a seafaring man." «Why, fir," said I,
ix will you go to sea no more?" "That is another
"cafe/'
21
"case/' said he, "it is my calling, and there-
"fore my duty; but as. you made this voyage
*c for a trial, you fee what a taste heaven has giv-
"en you of what you are. to expect, if you per-
*< list. Perhaps this is all befallen us on your
"account; like Jonah in the ship of Tarsliisti/?
"Pray," continues he, "what are you,, and on
*' what account did you go to sea?" Upon that,
I told him some of my story, at the end of which,
he burst out with a strange kind of passion,
"What have I done," said he, "that such an
"unhappy wretch should come into my ship? I
"would not set my foot in the same ship with
"thee again, for a thousand pounds." This in-
deed was, as I said, an excursion of his.spirits,
which were yet agitated by the fense of his loss,
and was farther than he could have authority to

choly part of our story, our Ihip being disabled,
aud three of .our men killed, and eight wounded,

I was undone without redemption. But alas!
this was but a taste of the misery I was to go
through as will appear in the, sequel of this story.
As my new patron, ox master, had taken me
home to his house, so I was in hopes that he
would take me with him when he went to sea
again, believing that it would some time or
pther be his fate to be taken by a Spanilh or Por-
tugal.
tugal nian of war, and that then I stiould be set at
liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken
away; so? when he went to sea, he left me on
fliore to look after his little garden, and do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house;
and when he came home again from his cruise,
he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look after
the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and
what method I might take to effect it, but found
no way that had the least probability in it. No-
thing presented to make the supposition of it ra-
tional; for I had nobody to communicate it to
that would embark with me; no fellow-slave,
no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman there but
myself; so that for two years, though I often
pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never
had the least encouraging prospect of puttipg it
in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance
presented itself, which put the old thought of
making some attempt for my liberty again in my
head: My patron lying at home longer than
usual, without fitting out his sliip, which, as I
heard was for want of money; he used constantly
once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the
weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnace and
go out into the road a fishing; and as he always
took
Z9
took me and a. youftg Maresco with him to row
the boat, we made him- very merry,, aird I proved
very dextrous in catching fish, insomuch that
sometimes he would fend me with a Moor, one of
his kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of filh for him.
It happened one time, that going a fishing in
a stark calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though we were not half a league from the sliore
we lost sight of it; and rowing, we knew not
whither, or which way, we laboured all day and
all the next night, and when the morning came,
we found we had pulled off to sea, instead of
pulling in for the stiqre, and that we were at least
two leagues from the stiore: However we got
well in again, though with a great deal of la-
bour, and, some danger, for the wind began to
blow pretty fresh in the morning; but particu-
larly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, re-
solved to take moreHcare of himself for the fu-
ture; and having lying by him the longboatof our
Englisli ship he had taken, he resolved he would
not go a fishing any more without a compass and
some provision; so he ordered the carpenter os
Jiis ship, who was also an English slave, to build
a little state room or cabbin in the middle of the
lomr

long-boat; like that of abafge, with a place to
stand behind it to steer and haul home the main-'
sheet, and'room before; for ajhand or two to:stahcs
and work the sails* She sailed with whatrwe call
aihmilderof mutton sail,* and tlife booth gibb*d
over the top of thfe cabiny which lay very snugs
and low, and had in it room for him to lie with a
stave or two, and a table'to; eat on, with1 some
small lockers ]to put in some bottles of such liquor
ashe thought fit to drinks particularly his' bredd;
rice, and coffee. ,"
WE'went frequently out witlv this boat ^fish-
ing, and as I was most dextrous to catch fiflbi; for
himj he never went without me; It happ;eried:
that he had appointed to* go out in this boat, eitlief
for pleastire or for fish, with two* or three Moors
of some distinction in that place^ and for whom
he had provided extraordinarily^ and had there-
fore sent on board the boat ovef-night a larger
store of provisions than ordinary, and had Ordered
me to get ready three fusees/ with powder and
jfhot, which were on board his ship, for that they1
designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing*
I *got all things ready as he had directed, arid1
waited the next morning with the boat waflied:
fclean, her antient and penantsout, and every1
thing to accommodate his guests: When by and
by
by my patron came on .board atone, and fold
me his guests had put off going, upon some bu-
siness that fell out,, and ordered me withtherrian
and b°}r* as usual, tp go out with the boat, and
catch them some fiih, for that his friends were to
sup at his house; and commanded that as soon as
I had got some fish, I should bring it home to his
house; all which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, fop now 1 found I was
like to.have a little sliip at my command; and
my, master,being gone, I prepared to furnistv my-
self,.not for a filhing business, but for a voyage;
though I knew hot, neither did I so much-as con-
sider^ whither! ihould steer, for any where to get
put of that place was -my«way.' •
Myi first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something/for our
subsistence,on board; for I told him we must not
presume, to eat of our patron's bread; he said
that was.true;.so he brought a large basket of
rusk or biscuit of their kind, ai\d three jars with
freih water into the boat; I knew where my pa-
tron's cafe of bottles stood, which it was evident
by, the make, were taken out of some English
priz§, and I conveyed them into the boat while
the Moor was on Ihore, as if they had been there
belore
A D VENTURES O
before for our master. 1 conveyed also a grfeaf
lump of bees wax into the boat, which weighed
above half a hundred weight; with a pat eel of
twine or thread, a hatchet, a &w; afrd a ham-
mer, all which were of great use to' us after-
wards, especially the wax to make candles.
Another trick I tried upon him, which he
innocently came intd also; his name was Ismaef;
whom they called Muley or Moley; so I called
to him, " Moley," said I, " our patron's guns'
"are on board the boat, can you not get a litttfe
€e powder and shot? it may be we may kill some
"acalmies (fowl like our curlieus) for ourselves;
"for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the
"ship." "Yes/' fays ha, " I'll bring some;"'
and accordingly he brought a great leather pouchy
which held about a pound and half of powder^
or rather more, and another with stiot that had
five or fix pounds^ with some bullets, aiid put alt
into the boat: at the fame time I found somd
powder of my master's in the great cabin, withr
which I filled one of the large bottles in the cafe;
which was almost empty*; pouring what was in ic
into another; and thus furnilhed with every
thing needful, we sailed out of the port to sift;
the castle, which is at the entrance of the port/
knew who we were, and took no notice of us
and We were not above a mile out of the port, be-
fore we hauled in our s^il; and set us down to fif^;'
The wind blew from N. N. E. which was con-
trary to my desire; for, had it blown southerly, I
had been fare to have made the coast of Spain,
and at last reached to the bay of Cadiz: but my
resolutions were, blow which way it would, I
wovild be gone frdm that horrid place where I
was, and leaye the rest to fate.
After we had fished sortie time and catched no-
thing, for when I had fifli on my hook I would
hot pull them up, that he might not fee them.;.
I said to the Moor, "This will not do, bur maf-
u ter will not be thus served, we must stand far-
ther off. He, thinking no harm* agreed; and
being in the.head of the boat* set the sails; and
as I had the helm* I run the boat Oijt near a
league farther, and then brought her to, as, if I
would fish. Then, giving the boy the helm* I-
stepped forward to where the Moor was_, and
making as if I stooped for something behind him,
I took him by surprise with my arm under his'
twist* and tossed him clear overboard into the
sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like jgL
cork, and called to me, begged to be taken ia,
told me he would go all the world over with me.
He swam so strong after the boat, that he^would.
have reached me very quickly, there being bu£
little wind; upon which I stepped" into the cab-
bin, and. fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I

presented it at him, and told him, "I had done
"him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would
"do him none; but, said I, you swim well
cc enough to reach the sliore, and the sea is calm,
"make the best of your way to shore, and I will
<f do you no harm: but if you come near the
<f boat, I will shoot you through the head, for I
cc am resolved to have my liberty," So he tump-
ed himself about, and sw^m for the lhore; ^nd I
make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for
he was an excellent swimmer*
I could have been content' to have taker* thi£
Moor with me, and have drowned the boy, but
there was no venturing to trust him* When he
Avas gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called
Xury, and said to him, "Xury, if you will be
"faithful to me, I will make you a great man $
« but if you will not stroak your face to be true
"to me, (that is, swear by Mahomet and his
<c father's beard) I must throw you into the sea
"too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke
so innocently, that I could not mistrust him, and
swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the
world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was
swimming, I stood out directly to the sea with
the boat, rather stretching tq-windward, that they
might
1$
Slight think me gone towards the Strait's mouth,
(as indeed any one that had be6n in their wits
must have been supposed to do) for who would
have supposed we were sailed on to the south-
ward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole
ftations of Negroes were sure to surround us with
their canoes, and destroy us; where we could
never once go on shore, but we should be devoured
by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of
human kind.
But as soon as it grew diifk in the evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending toy course a little toward the
east, that I might keep in with the sliore; and
having a fair freih gale of wind, &hd a smooth
quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe by the
the next day, at three o'clock in the afternoon,
when I first made the land, I could not be less
than 150 miles south of Sallee, quite beyond the
Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of
any other King ther'eaboyts, for we saw no peo-
ple*
Yfit such -was the fright I had takeil at the
Moors, and- the dreadful apprehensions I had of
falling into their hands, that I would not stop,
t>r go on shore, or come to ail anchor, the wind
Continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner
D 2 five
ADVENTURES OF
five days; and then the wind shifting "to the
southward, I concluded also, that if any of our
vessels were hi chafe of me, they also would now
give over: so I ventured to make to the coast,
and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little
river. I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, or what
river. I neither saw or desired to see any people.;
the principal thing I wanted was frelh water.
We came into this creek in the evenings resolving
to swim on s ore as soon as it was dark, and dis-
cover the country; but as soon as it was quite
dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the bark-
ing, roaring and howling of wild creatures^, of we
knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready
to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on
Ihore till day. "Well, Xury," said I, "then I
"will not; but, it may be, we may see men by
sc day, who will be as bad to us as those lions.'*
"Then we give them the shoot-gun," fays Xury,
laughing; "make them run way."—SuchEngliih
Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves*
However, I was glad to fee the boy so cheerful,
and I gave him a dram out of our patron's cafe
of bottles, to cheer him up. After all, Xury's
advice was good, and I took it. We dropped
our little anchor, and lay still all night; 1 fay,
. still, for we slept n<?ne; and in two or three hours
we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what
. 2 tO
37
to call them) of many forts, come down to the
sea-sliore, and run into the water, wallowing and
washing themselves, for the pleasure of cooling
themselves, arid they made such hideous howl-
iftgs md yellingSj that I never indeed heard the
Jike,
XtfRY was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so
was I too; but we were both more frighted when
we heard one of these mighty creatures come
swimming towards our boat; we could not fee
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to
be a monstrous, huge, and furious beast, Xury
said it was a lion, and it might be so for aught I
know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the
anchor and row away. 6C No, fays, I Xury
« we can flip our cable with the buoy to it, and
"go off to sea: they cannot follow us far,?* I
had no sooner said so, but I perceived the crea-
ture (whatever it was) within two oars length,
which something surprized me; however, I im-
mediately stept to the cabbin door, and taking
up my gun, fired at him: upon which he im-
mediately turned about, and swam to the shore
again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrible
noises, and hideous cries and howlings that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as
D 3 higher
ADVENTURES OF
higher within the country, upon the noise or re-
port of the gun; a thing, I believe, those crea-
tures had never heard before* This convinced
me there was no going on shore for us in the night
upon that coast, and how to venture on flbore in
the day was another question too; for to have
fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had
Ipeen as bad as to have fallen into the paws of
lions and tygers; at least we were equally appre«r
hcnsive of the danger of it?
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
shore somewhere or other for water, for we had
not a pint left in the boat; when and where to,
get it was the point. Xury said, if I wpuld let
him go on sliore with one of the jars, he would'
find if there was any water, and bring some to
me. I asked him <c why he would go? why I
"ihould not go, and he stay in the boat }u The
boy answered with so much affection, that he
made me love him ever after. Says he, " If
» ?c wild mans come they eat me, you go way."
"Well, Xury," said I, "we will both go; and
"if the wild rpaijs come, we will kill them; they
<c shall eat neither of us." So I gave Xury a
piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our
patron's cafe of bottles, which I mentioned be-
fore; and we haled the boat as near the sliore as
we thought was proper, and so waded to shore,
carrying
39
carrying nothing but our arms and two jars for
water,
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat,
fearing the coming of canoes with savages down
the river; but the boy seeing a low place about
a mile up the country, rambled to it; and by and
by I saw him come running toward me. I thought
he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with
some wild beasts and I ran forwards towards him
to help him; but, when I came nearer to him, I
saw something hanging over his stioulders, which
was a creature that he had stiot, like a hare, but
different in colour, and longer legs; however, we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
but the great joy that poor Xury came with was
to tell me, he had found ejood water, and seen no
wild maps.
But we found afterwards, that we need npt
take such pains for water, for a little higher up
the creek where we were, we found the water
fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a
little way up; so we filled our jars, and, haviqg
% fire, feasted on the hare we had killed; and pre-.
pared to go on our way, having seen no foot-
steps of any human creature \x\ that part of tjie
country.

ADVENTURES OF
As I had been one voyage to this coast before^
I knew very well that the islands of the Canaries,
and the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far
from the coast. But as I had no instruments to
take an observation, to know what latitude we
Were in, and did not exactly know, or at least re-
member what latitude they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or when to stand off to
sea towards them, otherwise I might now have
easily found some of these islands. But my hope
tvas, that if I stood a long this coast, till I came
to the part where the Englilh traded, I should find
some of their vessels upon their usual design of
trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, the place wher$
I now was, must be that country, which lying
between the Emperor of Morocco's dominions
and the negroes, lies waste ^nd uninhabited, ex-
cept by wild beasts, the negroes having aban-
doned it, and gone farther south, for fear of the
Moors, and the Moors not thinking it worth in-
. habiting, by reason of its barrenness; and indeed,
both forsaking it because of the prodigious num-
bers of tygres, lions, leopards, and other furious
cfeatures which harbour there; so that the Moors
uso it for their hunting only, where they go like,
an army, two or three thousand men at a time ;,
and indeed, for near an hundred miles together.
upo^
Upon the coast, we saw nothing but a waste unin-
habited country by day, and heard nothing but
bowlings and roaring of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the day-time, I thought I saw
the Pico of Teneriffe, being the top of the moun-
tain Teneriffe in the Canaries ; and had a great
mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither,
but having trted twice, I was forced in again by
contrary winds; the sea also going too high for
my little vessel, so I resolved to pursue my first
jdesign, and keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh
water, after we left this place; and once in par-
ticular; being early in the morning, we came to
an anchor under a little point of land which was
pretty high, and the tide beginning to flow, we
lay still, to go farther in: Xury, whose eyes
were more about him, than it seems mine were,
palls softly to me, and tells me, "that we had
"best go farther off the lhore; for," fays he,
ftf |ook yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side
"of that hillock, fast asleep:" I looked where he
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for
it was a terrible great lion, that lay on the side of
the lhore, under the lhade of a piece of a hill,
that hung as it were over him. "Xury," fays I,
ff you shall go on lhore and kill him:" Xury
looked
looked frighted, and said, ",Me kill! he eat me
46 at one mouth one mouthful he meant:
However, I said no more to the boy, but bad him
lie still; and I took our biggest gun, which was
almost musquet bore, and I loaded it with a good
charge of powder, and with two, stags,, and laid it
down; then I loaded another gun with two bul-
lets, and the third, for we had three pieces, I
loaded with five smaller bullets: I-took the best
aim I could with the first piece, to have shot him
into the head, but he lay so with his leg raised
a little a£>ove his nose, that the slugs, hit his leg
about the knee, and broke the bone ; he started,
up, growling at first, but finding his leg broke,
fell down again, and then gat up upon three legs,
and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard;
I was a little surprized that I did not hit him on
the head; however, I took up the second piece
immediately, and though he began to move off,
fired again, and lfyot him into th? head, and had
the pleasure to see him drop, and make but lit-*
tie noise, but lay struggling for life. Then Xury
took heart, and would have me let him go on
store: v Well go," said I, so the boy jumped
into the water, and taking a little gun in one
hand, swam on Ihore with the other hand, and
coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of
the piece to his ear, and stiot him into the head
?igain, which dispatched him quite.
43
This was game indeed to us, but it was no
food, and I was very sorry to lose three charges
kof powder and shot, upon a creature that was
good for nothing to us. However, Xury said,
he would have some of him; so he comes on
board, and asked me to give him the hatchet;
for what Xury?" said I; "Me cut off his
head," said he. However, Xury could not cut
off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it
with him, and it was a monstrous great one. I
bethought myself, however, that perhaps the
fcin of him, might one way or other, be of some
value to us; and I resolved to takeoff his ikin, if
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him;
but Xury was much the better workman at it, for
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us
both up the whole day, but at last we got the
hide pf him, and spread it on the top of our cab-
bin, the sun effectually dried it in two days time,
^nd it afterwards fefved rne to lie upon.
After this stop we made on to the southward
continually, for ten or twelve days, living very
sparing on our provisions, which began to abate
very much, and going no oftner into the shore,
than we were obliged to go for frelh water; my
design in this, was to make the river Gambia, or
Senegal, that is to fay, any where about the Cape
$e Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some
European
44
adventures of
European strip, and if I did not, I knew not what
course to take, but to seek out for the islands, or
perish among the negroes, I knew that all the
lhips from Europe, which sailed either to the
coast of Guinea, or to Brafil, or to the East-Indies,
made this cape, or those islands; and in a Word,
I put the whole of my fortune on this single
point; either that I must meet with some strip., or
must perish*
When I had pursued this resolution, about ten
days longer, as I have said, I began to see that
the land was inhabited, and in two or three
places as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon
the shore to look at us; we could also perceive,
they were quite black, and stark naked. I was
once inclined to have gone on stiore to them, but
Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me,
no go, no go :" However, I haled in near the
shore, that I might talk to them, and I found
they run along the stiore by me a good way; I
observed, they had no weapons in their hands,
except one, who had a long slender stick, which
Xury said was a lance, and that they would throw
them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a
distance, but talked to them by signs, as well as
I could, and particularly made signs for some-
thing to eat; they beckoned to me to stop my
boat, and that they would fetch me some meat;
upon

45
upon this I towered the top of. my fail, and lay
by, and two of them run up into the country, and
in less than half an hour came back, and brought
with them, two, pieces of dry flesh and some corn,
such as is the produce of their country; but we
neither 'knew what the one or the other was;
however we were willing to accept it, but how to
come at it was our next dispute, for I was not for
venturing on shore to them, and they .were as
much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for
us all, for they brought it to the shore, and laid
it down, and went and stood a great way off till
we fetched it on board, and then came close to us
again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportu-
nity offered that very instant to oblige them won-
derfully; for while we were lying by the shore,
came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the o-
ther (as we took it) with great fury, from the
mountains towards the sea; whether it was the
male pursuing the female, or whether they were
in sport, or in rage, we could not tell, any more
than we could tell wether it was usual or strange;
but I believe it was the latter, because in the first
place, those ravenous creatures, seldom appear
but in the night, and in the second place, we
found the people terribly frighted, especially the
women.

womcii. The man that had the lance, or darfy
did not fly from them, but the rest did; however/
as the two creatures ran directly into the watery
they did riot seem to offer to fall upon any of the
tiegrOes, but plunged themselves into the sea/
and swam about, as if they had come for their
diversion: at last, one of them began to come
nearer our boat, than at first I expected; but I
lay ijeady for him, for I had loaded my gun with
all possible expedition, and bad Xury load both
the others; as soon as he came fairly within my
reach, I fired and shot him directly into the head;
immediately he sunk down into the water, but
rose instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he
was struggling for life, and so indeed he was;
he immediately made to stiore, but between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strang-
ling of the water, he died just before he reached
the shore.
It is impossible, to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures, at the noise and fire of my
gun; some of them were even ready to die for
fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror i
but when they saw the creature deady and sunk in
the water, and that I made signs to them to' comes
to the stiore, they took heart and came to the
stiore, and began to search for the creature. I
found him by his blood staining the water, and
by
47
by the 'help of a rope, which I slung round him,
•and gave the negroes to haul ; they dragged him
oh shore, and found that it was a most curious
leopards spotted and fine, to an admirable de-
gree; and the negroes held up their hands with
{admiration, to think wh&t it was I had killed him
with.
The other* creature, frighted with the flash of
fire, and the noise of the gun, swam on stiore, and
Tan up directly to the mountains from whence it
came; nor could I at that distance, know what it
was. I found quickly the negroes were for eat-^
Ing the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to
have them take it as a favour from me, which
when I made signs to them, that they might take
him, they were very thankful for; immediately
they fell to work with him, and though they had
no knife," yet with a sharpened piece of wood,
they took off his skin as readily, and much more
readily, than we could have done with a knife;
they offered me some of the flesh, which I de-
clined, making a$ if I would give it them, but
made signs for the skin, which they gave me very
freely, and brought me a great deal more of their
provisions, which, though I did not understand,
yet accepted; then I made signs to them for some
water, and held out one of my jars to them, turn-
ing it bottom upward, to shew that it was empty,
apd

and that I wanted to have it filled. They called
immediately to some of theif friends, and there
came two women, and brought a great vessel
made of earth, aqd burnt, as I suppose in the
fun; this they set dowq for me, as before, and |
sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them
all three. The women were as stark naked 3s the
men,
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such
as it was, and water, and leaving my friendly ne-
groes, I made forward for about eleven days
more, without offering to go near the shore, till
I saw the land run out a great length into the sea.,
at about the distance of four or five leagues be--"
fore me, and the sea being very calrii, I kept.^
large offing to make this point; at lengths doub-
ling the point, at about two leagues from the
land, I saw plainly, land on the other side to sea-
ward 5 then I concluded, as it was most certain
indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
the islands, called from thence^ Cape de Verd
islands. However, they were at a great distance^
and I could not well tell what I had best to do,
for if I should be taken with a gale of wind, I
might neither reach one stor the othef.-
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stept
into the cabin, and fat me down, Xury having
the
49
Hie helm, when on a sudden the boy cried out,
"Master, master, a stiip with a sail;" and the
foolisli boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking
it mult needs be some of his master's ships sent to
pursue us, when4 I knew we were gotten far
enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the
cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship,
but what she was, (viz.) that it was a Portuguese
ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the coast of
Guinea for negroes. But when I observed the
course Ihe steered, I was soon convinced, they
were bound some other way* and did not design
to come nearer to the fliore; upon which I stretch-
ed out to sea as much as I could, resolving to
speak with them if possibles
With all the sail I eould make, I found I stibuld
hot be able to come in their way, but that they
would be gone by, before I could make any sig-
nal tci them i but after I had crowded to the ut-
inost, and began to despair* they it seems saw me
by the help of prespectiVe glasses* and that it was
some European boat, which* as they supposed,
must belong to some ship that was lost, so they
shortened sail to let me cdme up. I was encou-
raged with this, and as I had my patron's antient
on board, I made a waft of it to them, for a sig-
nal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they
sow* for they told me they saw the smoke, though
E they
they did riot hear the gun; upon these 'signals,
they very kindly brought to,, and lay by for me,
and in about three hours time, I came up with
them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and
in Spanish, and in French, but I understood
none of them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was
Onboard, called to me, and I answered him, and
told him I was an Englishman, that I had made
my escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sal-
lee; then they bade me come on board, and very
kindly took me in, and all my goods.
It was art inexpressible joy to me, which any
one will believe, that I was thus delivered, as
I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost
hopeless condition as I was in, and I immediately
offered all I had to the captain of the "ship, as a
return for my deliverance; but he generously
told me, he would take nothing from me, but
that all I had should be» delivered safe to me, when
I came to the Brasils. "For,3'' fays he, "I have
"saved your life on no other terms than I would
"be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one
<( time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the
*c same condition: besides," said he, "' when I
« carry you to the Brasils, so great a way from
*c your own country, if I sliould take from
\ you
5*
you what you have, you will be starved there,
<< and then 1 only take away that life I have gi-
u' ven." "No, no* Seignior Inglese," fays he,
(Mr. Englishman) u I will carry you thither in
•« charity, and these things will help to buy yo\<r
<c subsistence there, and your passage home again."
As he was charitable in his proposals so he was
just in the performance to a tittle, for he ordered
the seamen that hone should offer to touch any
thing I had; then he took every thing into
his own possession and gave me back an exact:
inventory of them, that I might have them, even
so much as my three earthen jars*
, As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that
he saWj and told me he would buy it of me for
the ship's use, and asked me what I would have
for it t t told him* he had been so generous to
-me in every thing, that I could not offer to make
any price of the bdatj but left it entirely to him,;
upon which he told me, he would give me a note
of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for
It at Brafil, and when it came there, if any one
offered to give more, he would make it lip. He
offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my
boy Xury, which I was loth to take, not that I
was not willing to let the Captain have him, but
I was very loth to fell the poor boy's? liberty, who
E 2 had

had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own. However, when I let him know my rea-
son, he owned it to be just, and offered me this
medium, that he would give the boy an obliga-
tion to set him free in ten years, if he turned
Christian; upon this, and Xury saying he was
willing to go to him, I let the Captain have
him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and
arrived in the bay de Todos los Santos, or All
Saints bay, in about twenty-two days after. And
now I was once more delivered from the most
miserable of all conditions of life; and what to
do next with myself I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the Captain gave me
I can never enough remember; he would take
nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty
ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the
lion's skin which I had in my boat, and caused
every thing I had in the sliip to be punctually
delivered me; and what I was willing to fell he
bought of me, such as the cafe of bottles, two of
my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees wax,
for I had made candles of the rest: in a word, I
made about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo,
and with this stock I went on sliore in the Brasils.
I had

I had not been long here, but being recom-
mended to the house of a good honest man like
himself, who had an ingenio, as they call it, (that
is, a plantation and a sugar-house) I lived with
him some time, and acquainted myself, by that
means, with the manner of their planting and
making of sugar; and seeing how well the plant-
ers lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I
resolved, if I could get licence to settle there, I
would turn planter among them, resolving, in the
mean time, to find out some way to get my mo-
ney, which I had left in London, remitted to me,
To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of
naturalization, I purchased as much land that
was uncured as my money would reach, and
formed a plan for my plantation and settlement,
and such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which I proposed to myself to receive from Eng-
land,
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of English parents, whose name was Wall, and
in much such circumstances as I was. I call him
my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on very sociably together.
My stock was but low as well as his, and we ra-
ther planted for food than any thing else, for
about two years. However, we began to in-
crease, and our land began to come into order; so

that the third year we planted some tobacco, and
made each of us a large piece of ground ready for
planting canes in the year to come: but we both!
wanted help, and now I found more than before,
I had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury^
- But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did
right, was no great wonder. I had no remedy
but to go on; I was gotten into an employment
quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary
to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook
my father's house, and broke through all his good
advice; nay, I was coming into the very middle
station, or upper degree of low life, which my
father advised me to before; and which, if I re-,
solved to go on with, I might have as well have
staid at home, and never have fatigued myself in
the world as I had done: and used often to say to
myself, i6 I could have done this as well in Eng-
<c land among my friends, as have gone five
"thousand miles off to do it -among strangers
v and savages in a wilderness, and at such a dis-
"tance as never to hear from any paVt of the
"world that had the least knowledge of me,"
In this manner I used to look upon my condi-
tion with the utmost regret, I had no body to.
converse with, but now and then this neighbour;
no work to be done, but by the* labour of my
hands\
%
55
hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a man
cast away upon some desolate island, that had no-
body there but himself* But how just has it
been, and how sliould all men reflect, that when
they compare their present conditions with others
that are worse, heaven may oblige them to make
the exchange, and be convinced of their former
felicity by their experience: I say, how just has
it been? that the truly solitary life I reflected on,
in an island of mere desolation, sliould be my lot,
who had so often unjustly compared it with the
life which I then led, in which, had I continued,
J had, in all probability^ been exceeding prosper-
ous and rich,
I was, in some degree, settled in my mea-
sures for carrying on the plantation, before my
kind friend, the Captain of the stiip that took me
Up at sea, went baqk; for the sliip remained there
in providing his loading, and preparing for his
voyage, near three months, when, telling him
what little stock I had left behind me ii^ London^
he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:
fC Seignior Inglefe," fays he, (for so he always
called me) if you will give me letters, and a
5s procuration here in form to me, with orders to
n the person who h^s. your money in London, to
"fend your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as
I stiall direct, and in such goods as are proper,
E 4 <c for
u for this country, I will bring you the produce
ic of them, God willing, at my return; but since
"human affairs are al} subject to changes and
"disasters, I would have you give orders for but
"one hundred pounds sterling, which, you fay,
"is half your stock, and let the hazard be run
"for the first; so that if it come safe, you may
cc order the rest the fame way; and if it mis*
"carry, you may have the other half to have
"recourse to for your supply.-
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it wa§
the best course I could take; so I accordingly
prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom
I had left my money, and a procuration to thq
Portuguese Captain, as he desired,
I wrote the English Captain's widow a full
account of all my adventures, my slavery, escape^
and how I had met the Portugal Captain at sea,
the humanity of his behaviour, and what condi-
tion I was now in, with all other necessary direc-
tions for my supply; and when this honest Cap-
tain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some
of the English merchants there, to fend over, not
the order only, but a full account of my story to.
a merchant at London, who represented it effec-
tually to her: whereupon she not only delivered
£he money, but out of her own pocket sent the
Portugal Captain a very handsome present for hi*
humanity and charity to me,
The merchant in London, vesting this hun*
dred pounds in English goods, such as the cap-*
tain had writ for, sent them directly to him at
Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me at the
Brasils, among which, without my direction (for
I was too young in my business to think of them)
he had taken care to have all forts of tools, iron-
work, and utensils neceflary for my plantation,
which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my for-
tune made, for I was surprized with the joy of
it; and my good steward the captain had laid out
the five pounds which my friend had sent him
for a present for himself, to purchase, and bring
pie over a servant under bond for six years ser-
vice, and would not accept of any consideration
except a little tobacco, which I would have him
accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all: but my goods being
all English manufactures, such as cloths, stuffs,
baize, and things particularly valuable and de-
sirable in the country; I found means to fell
fherii to a very great advantage; so that I might
say, I had more than four times the value of'-my?
first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my
poor neighbour, I mean in the advancement of
my plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought
me a negro slave, and an European servant also;
I mean another besides that which the captaift
brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made
the very means of our greatest adversity, so was
it with me. I went on the next ye^r with great
success in my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls;
pf tobacco on my own ground, mqre than I had
disposed of fq{- necessaries; among my neighbours;
and these fifty rolls being each 9s above 100 wt,
were well cured and laid by against the return of the
fleet from Ltfbqn; and now increasing in business
and in wealth, my head began to he full of pro-
jects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as
are indeed often tb? ruin of the best heads in bu<«
{5 ness.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, J
had room for all the happy things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my father so earnestly reT
commended a quiet retired life, and which he
had so sensibly described the middle station of life
to be full of; but other things attended me, and
I was still to be the wilful agent of all my owr>
miseries,
59
miseries, and particularly to increase my fault,
^nd double the reflections upon myself, which in
iny future sorrows I should have leisure to make;
all these miscarriages were procured by my ap-
parent obstinate adhering to my foolisli inclina-
tion, of wandering abroad, and pursuing that
inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views
of doii^g myself good in a fair and plain pursuit
ps those prospects and those measures of life,,
which Nature and Providence concurred to pre«*
 sent me with, and to make my duty*
As I had once done thus in my breaking away
from my parents, so I could not be content now,
but I must go and leave the happy view I had of
being a nth and thriving man in my new planta*
tion, only to pursue a rasli and immoderate desire
of rising faster than the nature of the thing ad-
mitted; and thus I cast myself down again into
the deepest gulph of human misery that ever man
fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life,
^nd a slate of health in the world.
To come then by the just degrees, to the par*
ticularsof this part of my story: You may sup-
pose, that having now lived almost four years in
the Brafils, and beginning to thrive and prosper
yery well upon my plantation; I had not only
learned
ADVENTURES OF
learned the language, but had contracted an ac-
quaintance and friendship among my fellow plant-
ers, as well as among the merchants at St. Sal-
vador, which was our port; and that in my dis-
courses among them, I had frequently given them
an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea, the manner of treating with the negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase on the
coast for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, scis-
sors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like; not
only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants teeth,
&c. but negroes for the service of the Brasils,
in great numbers*
They listened always very attentively to my
discourses on these heads, but especially to that
part which related to the buying negroes, which
was a trade at that time not only not far entered
into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on by
the affientos, or permission of the King of Spain
and Portugal, and engrossed in the public, so that
few negroes were bought, and those exceffivQ,
dear,
It happened, being In company with som§
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and,
talking of those things very earnestly, three
of them came to, me the next morning, and told
me they had been musing very much upon what;
I had
1 had discoursed with them of the last night, and
they came to make a secret proposal to me; and
after enjoining me to secrecy, they told me that
they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea;
that they had all plantations as well as I, and were
straitened for nothing so much as servants;
that as it was a trade that could not be carried on,
because they could not publicly sell the negroes
when they came home, so they desired to make
but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore
privately, and divide them among their own plan-
tations; and in a Word, the question was, whe-
ther I would go their supercargo in the stiip, to
manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea?
and they offered me that I should have an equal
stiare of the negroes, without providing any part
of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed,
had it been made to anyone that had not a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair way of coming to be very
considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But
for me that was thus entered and established, and
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
three or four years more, and to have sent for the
other hundred pounds from England, and who in
that time, and with that little addition, could
scarce have failed pf being worth three or four
thou-
thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing tod j
for me to think of such a voyage was the molt
preposterous thing that ever man, in such ch>
eumstances could be guilty osi
But I, that was born to be my own destroyerj
could no more resist the offer, than I could re-
strain my first rambling designs, when my father's
good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I
told them, " I would go with all my heart, if
they would undertake to look after my plan-
tation in my absence, and would dispose of it
to such as I sliould direct, if I miscarried."
This they all engaged to do, and entered into
Writings or covenants to do so; and I made a
formal will, disposing of my plantation arid ef-
fects, in cafe of my death, making the captain of
the ship that had saved my life as before^ my
^universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my
effects as I had directed in my will, one half of
•the produce being to himself, and the other to
be sliipped to England*
In stiort, I took all possible caution so preserve
tny effects, and keep up my plantation; had I
used half as much prudence to have looked into
my own interest, and have made a judgment of
what I ought to have done, and not to have done,
I had certainly never gone away from so pros-
perous
'perous an undertaking, leaving all the probable
Views of a thriving circumstance, and gone upon
a voyage to sea, attended with all its common
hazards; to fay nothing of the reasons I had to
expect particular misfortunes to myself*
But I was hurried on, and-obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason ; and
accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the
cargo furnilhed, and all things done as by agree-
ment, by my partners in the voyage, I went on
board in an evil hour, the first of September
1659, being the fame day eight years that I went
from my father and mother at Hull, in order to
act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to
my own interest*
Our ship was about 120 tons burthen, carried
"fix guns, and fourteen men, besides the master,
his boy, and myself; we had on board no large
cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit
for our trade with the negroes, such as beads,
bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially
little looking glasses, knives, scissars, hatchets,
and the like*
The fame day I went on board we set sail>

xoast, with design to stretch over for the African

coast, when they came about ten or twelve de*
grees of northern latitude, which it seems was
the manner of their course in those days. We
had very good weather, only excessive hot all the
way upon our own coast, till we came to the
height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence,
keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land,
and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fer-
nando de Noronha, holding our course N; E. bf
N. and leaving those isles on the east; in this
bourse we past the line in about twelve4 days
time, and were, by our last observation, in 17 de-
grees 22 minutes northern latitude, when a vio-
lent tornado or hurricane took us quite out of
our knowledge; it began from the south-east,
came about to the north-west, and then settled
into the north-east, from whence it blew in such
a terrible manner, that for twelve days together
we could do nothing but drive, and scudding
away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate
and the fury of the winds directed; and during
these twelve days, I need not fay that I expected,
every day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any
in the ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress, we had besides the terror of
the storm, one of our men died of the calenture,'
and one man and the boy was washed overboard;
about the 12th day, the weather abating a little,,

the master made an observation as well as he
could* and found that he was in about 11 degrees
north latitude, but that he was 22 degrees of lon-
gitude difference west from cape St. Augustino;
so that he found that he was gotten upon the
coast of Guinea, or the north part of Brafil, be-
yond the river Amazones, toward that df the ri-
ver Oroonoque, commonly called the Great Ri-
ver, and began to consult with me what course
he should take, for the sliip was leaky and very
much disabled, arid he was going directly back
to the coast of BrasiL
I was positively against that, and looking over
the charts of the coast of America with him, we
concluded there was no inhabited country for us
to have recourse to, till we came within the circle
of the Caribbee Islarids, and therefore resolved
to stand away for Barbadoes, which, by keeping
off to sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay or g.iilph
of Mexico^ we might easily perform; as we
hoped* in about fifteert days fail; whereas we
could not possibly make our Voyage *fo the coast
of Africa without some assistance, both to our
ship and ourselves.-
With: this design we changed our course,* ahtf
steered away N.-W. by W. in order to reach some
of our Englifli islands/ where I hoped for- reliefs
F but
ADVENTURES OF
but our voyage was otherwise determined, for be*
ing in the latitude 12 degrees 18 minutes, a se-
cond storm came upon us, which carried us
away with the fame impetuosity westward, and
drove us so out of the very way of all human
commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as
to the sea, we were rather in danger of being de-
voured by savages than ever returning to our own
country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very
hard,, one of our men, early in the morning, cried
out land; and we had no sooner run out of the
cabin to look out in hopes of feeing whereabouts
in the world we were, but the ship struck upon
a sand, and in a moment her motion being so
stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner,
that we expected we should all have perilhed im-
mediately, and we were immediately driven
into our close quarters to shelter us from the
very foam and spray of the sea*
It is not easy for any one who has not been in
the like condition, to describe or conceive the
consternation of men in such circumstances; we
knew nothing where we were, or upon what
land it was we were driven, whether an island or
the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited y
and as the rage of the wind was still great, tho*
rathef
rather less than at first, we could not so much as
hope to have the ship hold many minutes, with-
out breaking in pieces, unless the wind, by a kind
of miracle, should immediately turn about. In
a word, we fat looking upon one another, and
expecting death every moment; and every man
acting accordingly, as preparing for another
world, for there was little or nothing more for
us to do in this; thatwhich was our present com-
fort, and all the comfort we had, was, that, con-
trary to our expectation, the ship did not break
yet, and that the master said, the wind began to
abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a
little abate, yet the fliip having thus stuck upon
the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect
her getting off* we were in a dreadful condition
indeed, and had nothing to do, but to think of
saving our lives as well as we could; we had a.
boat at our stern just before the storm, but stie
was first staved by dashing against the ship's rud-
der, and in the next place slie broke away, and
either funk, or was driven off to sea, so there was
no hope from her; we had another boat on board/
but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful
thing; however^ there was no room to debate,
for we fancied the ship would break in pieces
F 2 every
AD VENTURES OF
every minute, and some told us, stie was actually-
broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the
men, they got her slung over the ship's side, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed our-
selves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy,
and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated
considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon
the shore, and might be well called, "den wild
6< zee/' as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for
we all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that
the boat could not live, and that we should be in-
evitably drowned. As to making fail, we had
none, nor, if we had, could we have done any
thing with it; so we worked at the oar towards
the land,, though with heavy hearts^ like men go-
ing to execution; for we all knew, that when
the boat came nearer to the sliore, she would be
dalhed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the
sea* However, we committed our souls to God
in the most earnest manner, and the wind driving
us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction
with our own hands, pulling as well as we could
towards land.
What
69
What the sliore was, whether rock or sand,
whether steep or stioal, we knew not; the only-
hope that could rationally give us the least lhadow
of expectation, was, if we might happen into
some bay or gulph, or the mouth os some river,
where by great chance we might have run our
boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and
perhaps made smooth water. But there was no-
thing of this appeared; but as we made nearer
and nearer the shore, the land looked more fright-
ful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging
wave, mountain-like, came rolling a stern of us,
and plainly bade us expect the "coup degrace/'
In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it
overset the boat at once; and separating us as
well from the boat, as from one another, gave us
not time hardly to fay, cf OGod!" for we were
all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt, when I sunk into the water; for
though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver
myself from the waves so as to draw my breath,
till that wave having driven me, or rather carried
me a vast way on towards the shore, and having
spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land
F 3 almost
ADVENTURES OF
almost dry, but half dead with the water I took
in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as
breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main
land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and
endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast
as I could, before another wave should return and
take me up again, but I soon found it was impos*
fible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me
as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy*
which I had no means or strength to contend with;,
my business was to hold my breath, and raise
myself upon the water, if I could; and so by
swimming to preserve my breathing, and pilot
myself towards the shore if possible; my greatest
concern now being, that the sea, as it would.car-,
ty me a great way towards the shore when it came
on, might not carry me back again with it, when
it gave back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried
me at once 20 or, 30 feet deep in its own body;
and I could feel myself carried with a mighty
force and swiftness towards the shore, a very great
way, but I held my breath, and assisted myself to
swim still forward with all my might, I was
ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as
I felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief,
I found my head and hands shoot out above the
surface of the water; and though it was not two
seconds
R O B I N S O N C R V S G Ei yi
seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet
it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new
courage. I was covered again with water a good
while* but not so long but I held it out; arid
finding the water had spent itself, and began to
return, I struck forward against the return of the
waves, and felt ground again with my feet, I
stood still a few moments to recover breath, and
till the water went from me, and then took to my
heels, and ran with whatstrength I had, farther
towards the Ihore. But neither would this deli-
ver me from the fury of the sc$, which came pour-
ing in after me. again, and twice more I was lifted
up by the waves, and carried forwards as before,
the shore being very flat,
The last time of these two had well near been
fatal to; me; for the sea having hurried me along
as before, landed me, or rather dalhed me against
a piece.of a rock, and that with such force, as it
left me senseless, and indeed helpless, to my own
deliverance; for the blow, taking my side and
breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out of
my body; and had it returned again immediately,
I must have been.strangled in the water; but I
recovered a little before the return of the waves,
and seeing I should again be covered with the
water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the
rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till

the wave went back; now as the waves were not
so high as at first, being $earer land, I held my
Jiold till the wave abated, and then fetched an?
other run, which brought me so near the sliore,
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet
did not so swallow me up as to carry me away,
and the next run I took, I got to the main land j-
where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the
clifts of the lhore, and fat me down upon the
grafs, free from danger, and quite out of the reach
of the water,
I was now landed, and safe on sliore, and be-?,
gan to look up and thank God, that my life was
saved, in a case, wherein there were some minutes
before scarce any room to hope, I believe it is
impossible to express, to the life, what the exta-
lies and transports of the foul are, when it is so
saved, as I may fay, out of the very grave; and
do I not wonder now at the custom, viz. that
when a malefactor, who has the halter ahout his
neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off,
and has a reprieve brought to him; I fay, I do
not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to
let him blood that very moment they tell him of
it, that the surprise may not drive the animal
spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him.
if For sudden joys, like griefs confound at first."
I WALKED
73
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my
hands; and my whole being, as I may fay, wrapt
up in the contemplation of my deliverance, mak-
ing a thousand gestures and motions, which I
cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comrades
that were drowned, and, that there should not be
one foul saved but myself; for, as for them, I
never saw them afterwards, or any sign of them,
except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes,
that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when
the beach and froth of the sea being so big, I
could hardly see it, (it lay so far off) and con-
sidered, Lord! how was it possible I could get
on sliore?
After I had solaced my mind with the comfort-
able part of my condition, I began to look round
me, to fee what kind of a place I was in, and
what was next to be done; and I soon found my
comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a
dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no
clothes to shift me, npr any thing either to eat or
drink to comfort me; neither did I fee any pros-
pect before me, but that of perishing with hun-
ger, or being devoured by wild beasts; and that
which was particularly afflicting to me was, that
I had no weapon, either to hunt and kijl any crea-
ture
ADVENTURES OF
creature for my sustenance, or defend myself
against any other creature that might desire
to kill me sot theirs. In a wordy I had no-
thing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe,
and a little tobacco in a box. This was all
my provision, and this threw me into such
terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I run
about like a madman. Night coming upon me,
I began with a heavy heart to consider what would
be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in
that country, seeing at night they always come
abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts
at that time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree
like a fir, but thorfiy, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the
next day what death I should die, for as yet I
saw no prospect: of life. I walked about a fur-
long from the shore, to see if I could see any fresh
water to drink, which I did, to my great joy;
and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my
mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and
getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself
so, as that if I sliould sleep I should not fall; and
having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for
my defence, I took up my lodging, and having
been excessively fatigued, I fell asleep, and slept
as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done
in my condition; and found myself the most re-
freshed
IS
freshed with it that I think I ever was on such
occasion.
When I waked, it was broad day, the weather
clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did
not rage and swell as before; but that which
surprized me most was, that the ship was lifted
off in the night from the sand where slie lay, by
the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost
as far as the rock which I first mentioned, where
I had been so bruised by the dastiing me against
it. This being within about a mile from the
stiore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
Upright still, I wished myself on board, that at
least I might save some necessary things for my
use.
When I came down from my apartment in the
iree, I looked about me again, and the first thing
I found was the boat, which lay as the wind and
the sea had tossed her up upon the land, about
two miles on my right-hand, I walked as far a$
I could upon the shore to have got to her, but
found a neck or inlet of water between me and
the boat, which was about half a mile broad; Ib
I came back for the present, being more intent
upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find
something for my present subsistence,
<•>>
A LITTLE
A little after noon I found the sea very
calm, and the tide ebbed so far out, that I could
come within a quarter of a mile of the ship; and
here I fonnd a fresli renewing of my grief, for I
saw evidently, that if we had kept on board we
had been all safe, that is to fay, we had all got
safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as
to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and
company, as I now was. This forced tears from
my eyes again, but as there was little relief in
that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship;
so I rolled up part of my cloaths on my back, the
weather being extremely hot, and took the wa-
ter: but when I came to the ship, my difficulty
was still greater to know how to get on board,
for as she lay aground, and high out of the water,
there was nothing within my reach to lay hold
of; I swam round her twice, and the second time
i spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered
I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-chains
ib low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of
it, and by the help of the rope got up into the
forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the
ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in
her hold, but that (he lay so on the fide of a bank
of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, al-
most to the water. By this means all her quarter
was free, and all that was in that part was dry;
fop
for you may be sure the first work was to search
and to see what was spoiled and what was free:
and first I found that all the ship's provisions were
dry and untouched by the water; and, being very
well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room,
and filled mv pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I
went about other things, for I had no time to lose.
I also found some rum in the great cabin, of
which I took a large dram, and which I had in-
deed need enough for to spirit me for what was
before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat,
to furnish myself with many things which I fore-
saw would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still, and wisti for what
was not to be had, and this extremity roused my
application; we had several spare yards, and two
or thre large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast
or two in the Ihip: I resolved to fall to work with
these, and I flung as many of them overboard as I
could manage for their weight, tying every one
with a rope that they might not drive away.
When this was done, I went down the ship's side,
and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast
together at both ends, as well as I could, in the
form of a raft, and laying two or three lhort
pieces of plank upon them cross ways, I found I
could walk upon it very well, but that it was not
able to bear any great weights the pieces being
too'
ADVENTURES O?
too light: so I went to work, and with the car*
penter's {aw I cut a spare top-mail into three
lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great
deal of labour and pains. But hope of furnish-
ing me with necessaries, encouraged me to go
beyond what I should have been able to have
done upon another occasion*
My raft was now strong enough to bear any
reasonable weight. My next care was to know
what to load it with, and how to preserve what I
laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I was
not long considering this: I first laid all the
planks or boards upon it that I could get, and
having considered well what I most wanted, I first
got three of the seamens chests, which I had
broke open and emptied, and lowered them down
upon my raft; the first of these I filled with pro*
visions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses*
five pieces of dry goats flesh, which we lived
much upon, and a little remainder of European
corn, which had been laid by for some fowls
which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls
were killed. There had been some barley and
wheat together, but, to my great disappoint-*
ment, I found afterwards, that the rats had eaten
or spoiled it all. "As for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belonging to our ikipper, in which
were some cordial waters; and in all, about five
or
or six gallons of rack. These I flowed by them-
selves, there being no need to put them into the
chest, nor any room for them. While I was dol-
ing this, I found the tide began to flow, though
very calm; and I had the mortification to fee my
coat and shoes, &c. swim away, which, thinking
too heavy to swim with, I had left on shore upon
the sand. This put me upon rummaging for
cloaths, of which I found enough, but took no
more than I wanted for present use, for I had
other things which my eye was more upon; as,
first, tools to work with on stiore, and it was after
long searching that I found out the carpenter's
chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to
me, and much more valuable than a lhip-loading
of gold would have been at that time. I got it
down to my raft, even whole as it was, without
losing time to look into it, for I knew in general
what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and
arms. There were two very good fowling-pieces
in the great cabin, and two pistols; these I se-
cured first, with some powder-horns and a small
bag of slsot, and two old rusty swords. I knew
there were three barrels of powder in the ship,
but knew not where our gunner had stowed them,
but with much search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the other had taken water. Those
two
two I got to the raft, with the arms. And now
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and be-
gan to think how I should get to shore with them,
having neither sail nor rudder; and the least cap
full of wind would have overset all my naviga-
tion.
I had three encouragements: i. A smooth
calm sea. 2. The tide rising and setting in to the
sliore. 3. What little wind there was blew me
towards the land. And thus, having found two
or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and
besides the tools which were in the chest, I found
two saws, an axe, and a hammer, and with this
cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts,
my raft went very well, only I found it drive a
little distant from the place where I first got to
land, by which I perceived that there was some
indraft of water, and consequently I hoped to find
some creek or river there, which I might make
use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared be-
fore me a little opening, of the land, and I found
a strong current of the tide set into it; sol guided
my raft, as well as I could, to get into the mid-
dle of the stream. But here I had like to have
suffered a second sliipwreck, which, if I had, I
think verily would have broke my heart; for-
knowing,
knowing nothing of the coast, my raft run
aground at one end of it upon a Ihoal, and not
being aground at the other end, it wanted but a
little that all my cargo had slipped off towards
that end, that was afloat, and so fallen into the
water. I did my utmost, by setting my back
against the chests, to keep them in their places,
but could not thrust off the raft with all my
strength, neither durst I stir from the posture I
was in, but holding Up the chests with all my
itiight. I stood in that manner near half an hour,
fri which time the rising of the water brought me
a little more upon a level; and a little after, the
Water still rising* my raft floated again* and I
thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel,
and then driving up higher, I at length found
myself in the mouth of a little river, with land
on both sides, and a strong curreht or tide run-
ning up; I lodked on both sides sot a proper
place to get to fliore, for I was not willing to be
driven too high ilp the river, hoping in time to
fee some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to
place myself as stear the coast as I could.
At length I spied a.little cove on the right
shore of the creek, to'which, with great pain and
difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last got so
near, as that, reaching ground with my oar, I
could thrust her directly in; but here I had like
vot. i. G to
82
ADVENTURES OF*
to have dipped all my cargo in the sea again, sot
that shore lying pretty steep, that is to fay, slop-
ing, there was no place to land but where one end
of my float, if it run on shore, would lie so high,
and the other sink lower, as before, that it would
endanger my cargo again. All that I could da
was to wait till the tide was a't highest, keeping
the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the
side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of
ground, which I expected the water would flow
over, and so it did. As soon as I found water
enough, for my raft drew about a foot water, I
thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and
there fastened or moored her, by sticking my two
broken oars into the ground, one on one side near
one end, and one on the other side near the other
end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away,
and left my raft $nd all my cargo safe on sliore.
My next work was to view the country, and
seek a proper place for my habitation, and where
to stow my goods to secure them from whatever
might happen. Where I was, Iyet knew not;
whether on the continent, or an island; whether
inhabited, or not inhabited; whether in danger
of wild beasts, or not. There was a hill, not above
a mile from me, which role up very steep and
high, and which seemed to over-top some other
hills, which lay as in a ridge from it northwards
I took
8J
I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of
the pistols, and an horn of powder; and thus
armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top ot
that hillj where], after I had with great labour
and difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate to
my great affliction^ viz. that I was in an island
environed every where with the sea, no land to
be seen except some rocks which lay a great way
off, and two small islands less than this> which lay
about three leagues to the west*
I found also that the island I was in was bar-
fen, and> as I saw gdod reason to believe, un-
ftihabited* except by wild beasts, of whom how-*
ever I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls,
but knew not their kinds, neither when I killed
them could I tell what was fit for food, and what
not. At my doming back* I stiot a great bird,
which I saw fitting upon a tree3 on the side of a
great wood. I believe it was the first gun that
had been fired there fiilce the creation of the
world—I had no sooner fired, but from all the
parts of the wood there arose an innumerable
number of fowls, of many sorts, making a con-
fused screaming* arid crying every one according
to his "usual note; but not one of them, of any
kind, that I knew. As for the creature I killed,
I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and
beak resembling it, but had no talons or claws
G 2 more,.

ADVENTURES OF
more than common. Its flelh was carrion, and
fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery,- 1 came back
to my raft, and fell to Work to bring my cargo
on fliore, which took me up the rest of that day;
and what tp do with myself at night I ktiew not,
nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie
down on the ground, not knowing but some wild
beast might devour me; though, as I afterwards
found, there was really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, 1 barricadoed
myself round with the chests and boards that I
had brought on shore, and made a kind of a hut
for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw
not which way to supply myself, except that I
had seen two or three creatures, like hares, run*
out of the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began- to consider, that I might yet get
a great many things out of the ship, wMch would
be useful to me, and particularly some of the rig*
ging and sails, and such other things as might
come to land; and I resolved to make another
voyage on board the vessel, :if possible* And as
I knew that the first storm that- blew must neces*
sarily break her all in pieces,. I resolved' to set
all other things apart^ till I got every thing
x out
out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a
council, that is to fay, in my thoughts, whether
I should take back the raft; but this appeared
impracticable: so I resolved to go as before,
when the tide was down; and I did so, only that
I stripped before I went from my hut, having
nothing with me but a chequered shirt, and a
pair of linen drawers, and a.pair of pumps on
my feet, .
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared
a second raft; and having had experience of the
first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded
it so ha!rd, but yet I brought away several things
very useful to me; as, first, in the carpenter's
stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and
spikes, a great screw jack, a dozen or two of
hatchets, and, above all, that most useful thing
called a gfind-stone. All these things I secured
together, with several things belonging to the
gunner, particularly two or three iron crows,
and two barrels of musquet-bullets, seven
musquets, and another fowling-piece, with some
small quantity of powder more; a large bag full
of small sliot, and a great roll of stieet lead: but
this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to
get it over the lhi'p's fide*
ADVENTURES OF
Besides these things, I took all the men's!
cloaths that I could find, apd a spare fore top-sail,
a hammock, and some bedding ; and with this I
loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe
pn sliore, to my very great comfort,
I was under some apprehensions, during my
absence from the land, that at least my provisions
might be devoured on shore; but when. I came
back, I found no sign of any visitor, only there fat
a creature like a wild cat upon one of the chests,
which, when I came towards it, ran away a little
distance, and then stood still. She fat very com*
posed and unconcerned, and looked full in my
face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with
me. I presented my gun at her, but as she did
not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned
at it, nor did she offer tp stir away ; upon which I
tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way I
was not very free of it, for my store was not great:
however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she,went to
it, smelled to it, and, eat it, and looked (as pleas-
ed) for more; but I thanked her, and could
spare no more; so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on sliore, though
I was fain to open the barrels of powder, and
bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy,
bejng large calks,1 I went to work to make me a
little
87
little tent with the sail, and some poles which I
cut for that purpose, and into this tent I brought
every thing that I knew would spoil, either with
rain or sun, and I piled all the empty chests and
casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it
from any sudden attempt, either from man or
beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door
of the tent with some barrels within, and an
empty chest set up on end without, and spreading
one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two
pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by
me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept
very quietly all night, for I was very weary and
heavy; for the night before I had slept little, and
had laboured very hard all day, as well,to fetch
ail those things from the ship, as. to get them on
shore.
I had the biggest magazine, of all kinds now,
that ever was laid up, I believe, for one man, but
I was n6t satisfied still; for while the ship fat
upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get
every thing out of her that I could: so every day
at low water I went on board, and brought away
something or other; but particularly the third
time I went, I brought away as much of the rig-
ging as I could, as also all the small ropes and
G 4 rope-
rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spar®
canvas, which was to mend the fails upon occar
sion, and the barrel of wet gun-powder. In a
word, I brought away all the fails first and last.,
only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, an4
bring as much at a time as I could; for they were
no more useful to be fails, but as mere canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still was^
that last of all, after I had made five or six such
yoyagcs as these, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the ship that was worth my med-:
dling with, I fay, after all this, I found a great
hogshead of bread, and three large runlets of
rum or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel
of sine flour; this was surprizing to me, because
I had given over expecting any more provisions^
except what was spoiled by the water; I soon
emptied the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped
it up parcel by parcel in pieces of the fails, which
I cut out; and in a word, I got all this safe on
shore also.
The next day I made another voyage, and
now having plundered the ship of what was port-
able and fit to hand out, I began with the cables;
and cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I
could move, I got two cables and a hawser on
sliore, with all the iron-work I could get; and
having
R0glN$0N C Jt U S 0 E, 89
'having cut down the fpritsail-yard, and the mi-
zen-yard, and every thing I could to make a
large raft, 1 loaded it with these heavy goods
and came off; but my good luck began now to
leav^e me; for this raft was so unwieldy, and so
soyer~loaden, that after I was entered the little
.cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods,
not being able to guide it so handily as I did the
Other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo
into the watej-; as for myself, it was no great
harm, for I was near the sliore; but as to my
cargo, it was great part of it lost, especially the
iron, which I expected would have been of great
use tp me; however, when the tide was oqt, I
got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some
of the iron, though with infinite labour; for I
was fain to dip into the water, a work which
fatigued me very much; after this I went every
day on board, and brought away what I could
get.
I had been now thirteen days on Ihore, and haci
been eleven times on board the ship; in which
time I had brought away all that one pair of
hands could well be supposed capable to bring,
though I believe verily, had the calm weather
held, I sliould have brought away the whole ship
piece by piece; but preparing the twelfth time
to gq on board, I found the wind began to rife;
* how-
however at low water I went on board, and though
I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectu-
ally, as that nothing more could be found, yet I
discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of
•which I found two or three razors, and one pair
of large sci stars, with some ten or a dozen good
knives and forks; in another I found about thir-
ty-six pounds value in money, some European
coin, some Brasil, some pieces of eight, some
gold, and some silver,
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money:
O drug! said I aloud, what art thou good for?
thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking off
the ground; one of these knives is worth all this
heap : I have no manner of use for thee ; even re-
main where thou art, and go to the bottom as a
creature whoso life is not worth saving. How-
ever upon second thoughts, I took it away, and
wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began
to think of making; another raft, but while I
was preparing this, I found the sky over-cast,
and the wind began to rife, and in a quarter of
an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore; it
presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to
pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore;
and that it was my business to be gone before the
tide of flood began,-or otherwise I might not be
able to reach the shore at all; accordingly I let
myself
smyself down into the water, and swam a-cross
the channel, which lay between the ship and the
sands, and even that with difficulty enough, part-
ly with the weight of the things I had about me,
and partly the roughness of the water, for the
wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite
Jiigh water, it blew a storm.
. But I was gotten home to my little tent, where
J lay with all my wealth about me very secure.
It blew very hard all that night, and in the morn-
ing when I looked out, behold, no more ship was
to be seen; I was a, little surprized, but reco-
vered myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz.
That I had lost no time, nor abated no diligence
to get every thing out of her that could be use-
ful to me, and that indeed there was little left in
her that I was able to bring away if I had more
time,
I now gave over any more thoughts of the
•ship, or of any thing out of her except what might
drive on (hore, from her wreck, as indeed divers
pieces of her afterwards did, but those were of
small use to me.
< My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myself against either savages, if any
fhpuld appear, or wild beasts, if anynvere in the
island;
island; and I had many thoughts of the method
how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to
make, whether I stiould make me a cave in the
earth, or a tent upon the earth*: And, in short,
I resolved upon both, the manner and description
of which, it may not be improper to give an ac^
count of*
I soon found the place I was in was not for
my settlement, particularly because it was upon
a low moorish ground, near the sea, and I be-
lieved it would not be wholesome, and more par-*
ticularly because there was no fresh water near
it, so I resolved to find a more healthy and more
convenient spot of ground,
I consulted several things in my .situation*
which I found would be proper for me: ist,
Health and fresh water I just now mentioned,
2dly, Shelter from the heat of the sun, ^dly,
Security from ravenous creatures, whether men
or-beasts, 4thly, A view to the sea, that if God
sent any ship in sight, I might not lose any ad-
vantage for my deliverance, of which I was not
willing to banisli all my expectation yet,
In search for a place proper for this, 1 found a,
little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose
front towards this little plain was steep as a
house -
R 6 B t N S 6 N c R u s d 93
house-side; so that nothing could come down upon
me from the top; on the side of this rock there
was a hollow place worn a little way in like the
entrance or door of a cave, but there was not
i'eally any cave or way into the rock at all.
On the flat of .the green,-just before this hol-
low place, I resolved to pitch my sent. This
plain was not above an hundred yards broad, and
about twice as long, and lay like a green before
my door, and at the end of it descended irregu-
larly every way down into the low-ground by
the sea-fide. It was on the N. N. W. side of the'
hill, so that 1 was sheltered from the heat every
day, till it came to a W. and by S. fun or there-
abouts, which in those countries is near the set-
ting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew half a circle
before the hollow place, which took in about tens
yards in its sertii-diameter from the rock, and
twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning
and ending,
In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they
stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being
out of the ground about five foot and an half,
and
94
ADVENTURE^ O P
and sharpened on the ton. The two rows' did not
.stand above six inches one from another*
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had
cut in the ship,- and I laid them in rows one?
upon another, within the circle, between these
two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about
two foot and an half high, like a spur to a post,,
and this fence was so strong, that neither man or
beast could get into it or over it. This cost me
a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut
the piles in the woods, bring them to the place^
and drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not
by a door, but by a sliort ladder to go over the
top, which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over
after me, and so I was completely fenced in, and
fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and
consequently slept secure in the night, which
otherwise I could not have done, though, as it
appeared afterward, there was no need of all this
caution from the enemies that I apprehended dan-
ger from*
Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour,
I carried all my riches, all my provisions, am-
munition, and stores, of which you have the
account

9$
a:c'c6iint above, and I made me a large tent, which,
to preserve me from the rains that in one part of
the year are very violent there, I made double,
viz. one smaller tent within, and one larger tent
above it, and covered the Uppermost with a large
tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed
which I had brought on sliore, but in a ham*
mock, which was indeed a very good one, and be-*
longed to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and
every 'thing that would spoil by the wet, and
having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the
entrance, which till now I had left open, and so
passed and repassed> as I faid^ by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my
way into the rock, and bringing all the earth and
stones that I dug down out through my tent, I
laid them up within my fence in the nature of a
terrace, that so it raised the ground within, about
a foot and an half; and thus I made me a cave,
just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar
to my house. It cost me much labour and many
days, before all these things were brought to
perfection; and therefore, I must go back to
some others, which took up some of my thoughts.
At
At this fame time k happened, after I had laid
my scheme for setting up my tent, and making
the cave, that a storm of rain,' falling from, a
thick dark cloud,- a sudden flaslx of lightning
happened, and after that, a g^eat clap of thun-
der, as is naturally the effect of it; I was not so
much surprised with the lightning, as I was with
a thought, which darted into my mind as swift as
lightning itself: O my powder! My very heart
sunk within me, when I thought, that at one"
blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on-
which, not only my defence, but the providing
me food, as I thought, entirely depended; I was
nothing near so anxious about my own danger,*
though had the powder took fire, I had never
kno wn who had hurt me;
Such impression did this make upon me, that
after the storm was over, I laid aside all my works,*
my building, and fortifying, and applied myself
to make bags and boxes, to separate the powder,
and keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in
hope that whatever might come, it might not all
take fire at once,, and to keep it so apart, that it
.should not be possible to make one part fire ano-
ther: I finished this work in about a fortnights
and I think my powder, which in all was about
24olb. weight, was divided in not less than a hun-
dred parcels; as to the barrel that had been wet,
I did
I did not apprehend any danger from that, so I
placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy, I
called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and
down in holcS among the rocks, so that no wet
might come to it, marking very carefully where
I laid it.
In the interval of time, while this wa3 doing,
I went out once at least every day with my gun,
as well to divert myself, as to fee if I could kill
any thing fit for food, and as near as I could to
acquaint myself with what the island produced.
The first time I went out, I presently discovered
that there were goats upon the island, which was
a great satisfaction to me; but then it was at-
tended with this misfortune to me, viz. That they
were so sliy, so subtil, and so swift of foot, that
it was the difficultest thing in the world to come
at them i but I was not discouraged at this, net
doubting, but I might now and then shoot one,
as it foon happened; for after I had found their
haunts a little,, I laid wait in this manner for
them ; I observed if they saw me in the vallevs*
though they were upon the rocks, they would run
* away as in a terrible fright; but if they were
feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks,
they took no notice of me; from whence Icon-
eluded, that by the position of their optics, their
sight was so directed downward, that they did not
vol, i. H readily
readily see objects that were above them, so after*
ward, I took this method; I always climbed the
rocks first, to get above them, and then had fre-
quently a fair mark. The first soot I made among
these creatures, I killed a she goat, which had a
little kid by her, which stte gave fuck to, which
grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell,
the kid stood stock still by her, till I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when I car-
ried the old one with me, upon my lhoulderr the
kid followed me quite to my enclosure, upon
which, I laid down the dam, and took the kid in
my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes
to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat, so
I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself; these
two supplied me with flesh for some time, for I
eat sparingly, and preserved my provisions (my
bread especially) as much as possible I could.
Having now fixed my habitation, and saved
some materials for kindling a light, I found it ab-
solutely necessary, to provide a place to make a
fire in, and fewel to burn; and what I did for
that> as also how I enlarged my cave, and what
conveniences I made, I shall give a full account
of in its proper place ; but I must first give some
little account of myself, and of my thoughts a-
bout living, which it may well be supposed,, were
not a few.
t 1 HAD
I had a dismal prospect: of my condition; for
as I was not cast away upon that island, without
being driven, as is said, by a violent storm, quite
out of the course of our intended voyage, and a
great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues out of
the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I
had great reason to consider it as a determination
of heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this
desolate manner, I should end my life; the tears
%would run plentifully down my face, when I
made these reflections ; and sometimes, I would
expostulate with myself, "Why providence
Ihould thus completely ruin its creatures, and
render them so absolutely miserable, so without
help abandoned, so entirely depressed,, that it
could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a
life*"
But something always returned swift upon me,
to check these thoughts, and to reprove me: and
particularly, one day walking with my gun in
my hand, by the sea-side, I was very pensive up-
on the subject of my present condition, when rea-
son as it were, expostulated with me the other
way, thus : "Well, you are in a desolate condi-
tion, it is true, but pray remember, where are
the rest of you? did not you come eleven of you
into the boat, where are the ten? why were not
they saved and you lost? why were you singled
H 2 out?
xoo
A 35 V ESf T U R 1 S Of
out ? is it better to be here,.or there?" And then
I pointed to the sea. All evils aie to be consider-
ed with the good that is in theiii, and with what
worse attends them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
furnished for my subsistance, and what would have
been my case if it had not happened (which was
a hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated
from thfc place where she first struck, and was
driven so near the shore, that I had time to get
all these things out of her. What would have
been my cafe, if Iliad been to have lived in the
condition in which I at first came an shore, with-
out necessaries of life,, or necessaries to supply and
procure them? Particularly, said I aloud, (though
to myself) what should I have done without a
gun, without ammunition, without any tools to
make any thing, or to work with, without clothes^
bedding, a tent, or any maftner of covering; and
that now, I had all these to a sufficient quantity,
and was in a fair way to provide myself, in such a
manner, as to live without my gun, when my
ammunition was spent : so that I had a tolerable
view of subsisting, without any want as long as I
lived; for I considered from the beginning, how
I would provide for the accidents that might
happen, and for the time that was to come, even
not only, after my ammunition sliould be spent,
but
But even, after my health, or strength, Æould
decay.
I confess, I had not entertained any notion of
my ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I
mean my powder being blown up by the light-
nings and thismade the thoughts of it so surpriz-
ing to rat, when it lightened and thundered, as
,1 observed just now.
And now, being to entef into a melancholy re-
lation of a fcene of silent life, such perhaps, as
was never heard of in the world before; I shall
take it from its beginning, and continue it in its
order. It was, by my account, the 30th of Sep-
tember, when, m the manner as above -said, I
first set foot upon this horrid island; when the fun
being, to us, in its autumnal equinox, was almost
just over my head; for I reckoned myself, by ob-
servation, to be in the iatitnde of 9 degrees 21
minutes, north of she line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve
days, it came into my thoughts, that I sliould
lose my reckoning of time, for want of books,
and pen and ink, and should even forget the sab-
bath days, from the working days; but to pre-
vent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large
post, in capital letters, and making it into a
H 3 great
101
ADVENTURES OF
great cross, I set it up op the shore where I first
landed, viz, "I came on shore here, on the 30th'
"of September, 1659." Upon the sides of this,
square post, I cut every day, a notch with my
Jcnife, and every seventh notch, was as long again
as the rest, and every first day of the month as
long again as that long one, and thus I kept my
kalendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly rec-
koning of time.
But it happened, that among the many things
which I brought out of the sliip, in the several
voyages, which as above mentioned, I made to it,
I got several things of less value, but not at all
less useful to me, which I found some time after,
in.rummaging the chests; as in particular, pens,
ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain's,
mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three
or four compasses, some mathematical instru-
ments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of
navigation, all which I huddled together, whe-,
ther I might want them or no; also I found three
very good bibles, which came to me in my car-
go from England, and which I had packed up
among my things; some Portugueze books also,
and among them, two or three Popish prayer
books, and several other books, all which.I care-
fully secured. And I must not forget, that we
had in tjie snip, a dog, and two cats, of whose
eminent
eminent history, I may have occasion to fay some-
thing in its place; for I carried both the cats
with me, and as for the dog, he jumped out of
the ship himself, and swam on sliore to me the
day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and
was a trusty servant to me for many years; I
wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any
company that he could make up to me, I only
wanted to have him talk to me, but that would
not do : As I observed before, I found pen, ink,
and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost,
and Isliall sliew, that while my ink lasted, I kept
things very exact, but after that was gone I could
not, for I could not make any ink, by any means
that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed to-
gether, and of these, this of ink was one, as also
a spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig, or refnove
the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for
linen, I soon learned to want that without much
difficulty.
This want of tools, made every work I did go
on heavily, and it was near a whole year, before
I had entirely finished my little pale, or sur-
rounded my habitation: The piles or stakes,
which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a
H 4 long
A1YENJVRES Of
long time in cutting and preparing in the wood's,
and more by far in bringing home; so th#t I spent
sometimes two days, in cutting and bringing
home one of those posts, and a third day, in driv-
ing it into the ground; for which purpose, I got
a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last be-
thought myself, of one of the iron crows, which
however, though I found it, yet it made driving
these posts, or piles, very laborious and tedious
work. But what need I have been concerned at
the tedioufness of any thing I had to do, sceipg I
had time enough to do it in ; nor had I any o-
ther employment, if that had been over, at least
that I could foresee, except the ranging the
island to seek for food, which I did more or less
every day.
I now begar; to consider seriously my condU
tion, and the circumstance I was reduced to; and
I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not
so much to leave them to any that were to come
after me, for I-was like to have but few heirs, as
to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon
them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason
began now to master my despondency, I began
to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set
the good against the evil, that I might have
something to distinguish my case from worse, aud
I stated it very impartially, like debtor and cre-
ditor^
<Jitor, the comforts I enjoyed, against the mise-
ries I suffered, thus;
Evil.
I am cast upon a
horrible, desolate
island, void of all
hope of recovery.
I am singled out
and separated, as it
were, from all the
world to be miser-
able.
I am divided from
mankind, a solitaire,
one banished from
human society.
I have not qloaths
to cover me.
I am without any
defence, or means to
resist any violence of
plan or beast.
Good.
But I am alive, and not
drowned, as all my ship's
company were*
But I am singled out too
from al) the ship's crew, to
be spared from death; and
he that miraculously saved
me from death, can deliver
me from this condition.
But I am not starved, and
perishing in a barren place,
affording no sustenance.
But I am in a hot climate,
where, if I had cloaths* I
could hardly wear them. -
But I am cast on an island,
where I fee no wild beasts to
hurt me, as I saw on the coast
of Africa i and what if I had
been shipwrecked there?
I have
I have no soul to ButGod wonderfully sent
speak to, or relieve the ship in near enough to
me, the sliore, that I have gotten
out so many necessary things
as will either supply my
wants, or enable me to sup-
ply myself as long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testi-
mony-, that there was scarce any condition in the
world so miserable, but there was something ne-
gative or something positive to.be thankful for
in it; and let this stand as a direction, from the
experience of the most miserable of all conditions
in this world, that we may always find in it some-
thing to comfort ourselves from, and to let, in
the description of good and -evil, on the credit
fide -of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish
my condition, and giving over looking out to. sea
to see if I could spy a sliip; I say, giving over
these things, I began to apply myself to accom-
modate my way of living, and to make things as
easy to me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which
was a tent under the fide Qf a rock, surrounded
with a strong pale of posts and cables^ but I might
now
now rather calf it a wall, for I raised a kind of
wall up against it of turfs, about two foot thick
on the outside; and after some time, I think it
was a year and a half, I raised rafters from it
leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it
with boughs of trees, and such things as I could
get to keep out the rain, which I found at some
times of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I
had made behind me. But I must observe too,
•that at 'first this was a confused heap of goods,
which, as they lay in no order, so they took up
all my place, I had no room to turn myself; so
I set myself to enlarge my cave and works farther
into the earth, for it was a loose sandy rock, which
yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it; and
To when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of
prey, I worked sideways to the right-hand into
the-rock, and turning to the right again, worked
quite out, and made me a door to come out in the
outside of my pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as
it were, a back way to my tent and to my stores
fiousc, but gave me room to stow my goods,
AND
IOS APYHTVRES OF
And now I began to apply myself to make
such necessary things as I found I most wanted,
as particularly a chair and a table, for without
these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I
had in the world; I could not write, or eat, or
do several things with so much pleasure without a
table. So I went to work : and here I must needs
observe, that as reason is the substance and origin
nal of the mathematicks, so by stating and squa-
ring every thing by reason, and by making the
most rational judgment of things, every man
may be, in time, master of every mechanic artt
I had never handled a tool in my life, and yet in
time by labour, application, and contrivance,
I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could
have made it, especially if I had had tools.
However, I made abundance of things, even
without tools; and some, with no more tools than
an adz and a hatchet, which perhaps were never
made that way before, and that with infinite la-
bour: for example, if I wanted aboard, I had no
other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an
edge before me, and hew it flat on either fide
with my axe, till I had brought it to be thin as a
plank, and then dubb it smooth with my adze.
It is true, by this method I could make but one
board out of a whole tree; but this I had no re-
medy for but patience any more than I had for
the prodigious deal of time and labour which it
took
4
took me up to make a plank or board: but
my time of labour was little worth, and so it was
employed one way as well as another*
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I
observed above, in the first place; and this I did
out of the lhort pieces of boards that I brought on
my raft from ^the ship* But when I wrought out
some boards, as above, I made large shelves of the
breadth of a foot and a half one over another, all
along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
nails, and iron-work on; and^ in a word, to separate,
every thing at large in their places, that I might
come easily at them. I knocked pieces into the
wall of the rock, to hang my guns, and all things
that would hang up.
So that had my caveibeen to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things;
and I had every thing so ready at my hand, that
it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods
in such order, and especially to find my stock of
all necessaries so great*
And now it was when I began to keep a journal
of every day's employment; for indeed at first I
was in too much hurry, and not only hurry as to
labour, but in too much discomposure of mind:
and my journal would have been full of many
dusl
A ft VENTURES OF
dull things* For example,. I must have said thus :<
"Sept. the 30th. After I had got tp shore, and
€< had escaped drowning, instead of being thank--..
fc ful to God for my deliverance, having first vo-
C€ mited with the great quantity of salt water
"which was gotten into my stomach, and reco^
"vering myself a little, I ran about the sliore
"wringing my hands, and beating my head and
"face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out,
"I was undone, undone; till tired and faint, I
<c was forced to lie down on the ground to repose,
€C but durst not steep, for fear of being de-
6C voured."
Some days after this, and after 1 had "been on
board the sliip and got all that I could out of her,-
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of
a little mountain, and looking out to sea, in
hopes of seeing a ship, then fancy at a vast dis^
tance I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes
of it; and then, after looking steadily till I was
almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep
like a child, and thus increase my misery by my
folly.
But, having gotten over these things in some
measure, and having settled my houstiold-stuff
and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and
all as handsome about me as I could, I began to
keep
keep my journal, of which I shall here give yoti
the copy, (though in it will be told all these par-
ticulars over again) as long as it lasted; for hav-
ing no more ink, I was forced to leave it off.
JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659, I poor miserable
Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a
dreadful storm in the offing, came on stiore on
this dismal unfortunate island, which I called the
Island of Despair, all the rest of the ship's com-
pany being drowned, and myself almost dead.
All the rest of that day 1 spent in afflicting
myself at the dismal circumstances I was brought
to, viz* I had neither food, house, cloaths, wea-
pon, or place to fly to, and in despair of any
relief, saw nothing but death before me, either
that I should be devoured by wild beasts, mur-
dered by savages, or starved to death for want of
food. At the approach of night I slept in a tree,
for fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.
October i. In the morning I saw, to my
great surprise, the sliip had floated with the high
tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer
thp island, which, as it was some comfort on one
,hand,
112, OP
hfifidj fof seeing her sit uprights atid not bfoketi
in pieces, I hoped; if the Wind abated, I friight
get on boards and get some food and necessaries
out of her for rfiy relief; so* on the other hand/
it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades*
who, I imagined, if we had all staid on board*
might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they
would not have been all drowned as they were 5
and that, had the men been saved, we might per-
haps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the
lhip, to have carried us to some other part of the
world* I spent great part of this day in perplex-
ing myself on these things ; but at length feeing
the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near
as I could, and then swam on board. This day
also it continued raining, though with no wind
at all.
From the istof October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in many several voyages to get
all I could out of the sliip, which I brought on
shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much fain
also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather; but, it seems, this was the tainy
season.
Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the good*
I had got upon it $ but, being in Ihoal water, and
tho
I
the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many
. of them when the tide was out.
Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with
some gusts of wind, during which time the ship
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be seen except
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I
spent this day in covering and securing the goods
which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil
them.
Oct. #6. I walked about the shore almost all
day to find out a place to fix my habitation, great-
ly concerned to secure myself from any attack in
the night, either from wild beasts or men.. To-
wards night I fixed upon a proper place under
a rockj and marked out a semi-circle for my en-
campment, which I resolved to strengthen with a
work, wall, or fortification, made of double piles,
lined within with cables, and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard
in carrying all my goods to my new habitation,
though some part of the time it rained exceed- *
ing hard.
The 31st in the morning I went out into the
island with my gun, to sec for some food, and dis-

cover the country, when I killed a she-goat, and
her kid followed me home, which I afterwards
killed also, because it would not feed,
Nov. i, I set up my tent under a rock* and
lay there for the first night making it as large as
I could with stakes driven in to swing my ham-
mock upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards^,
and the pieces of timber which made my rafts,
and with them formed a fence round me, a little
within the place I had marked out for my forti-
fication.
Nov. 3. I went out with my gun and killed
two fowls like ducks, which were very good food.
In the afternoon 1 went to work to make me a
table.
Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time
of sleep, and time of diversion, viz. every morn-
ing I walked out with my gun for two or three
hours if it did not rain, then employed myself ta
work till about eleven o'clock, then eat what I had
to live on, and from twelve to two I lay down to
sleep, the weather being so excesiive hot,, and
then in the evening to work again. The work-
ing
irig part of this day and of the next were wholly
employed in making my table* for I was yet but
a very sorry workman* though time and necessity
made me a corilplete natural mechanic soon after,
as I believe it ;would arty one else*
Nov, 5. This day went abroad with my gun
aftd my dog, and killed a wild cat, her Ikin pretty
soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every crea-
ture that. I killed I took off the skins, and pre-
served them; coming back by the sea shore, I
saw many sorts of sea fowl which I did not un-
derstand, but Was surprized, and almost frighted
with two or three seals, which, while I was gaz-
ing at, not well knowing what they were, got
into the sea, and escaped me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk I .went to
work with my table again, aud finished it, tho*
not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned
to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair Wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the
12th (for the nth was Sunday) I took wholly
up to make me a chair, and with much ado
brought it to a tolerable (hape, but never to
please me, and even in the making I pulled it in
pieces several times. Note, I soon neglected, my
I 2 keeping
keeping Sundays, for omitting my mark for
them on my post, I was puzzled to tell which
was which*
Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refrestied
me exceedingly, and cooled the earth, but it was
accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning,
which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my
powder; as soon as it was over, I resolved to se-
parate my stock of powder into as many little
parcels as possible, that it might not be in dan-
ger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent
in making little square chests or boxes, which
might hold about a pound or two pound at most
of powder: and so putting the powder in, I
stowed it in places as secure and remote from
one another as possible. On one of these three
days I killed a large bird that was good to eat,
but I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17. This day 1 began to dig behind my
tent intofrthe rock, to make room for my farther
convenience* Note, Two things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this work, viz. a pick-axe, a sliovel,
and a wheelrbarrow or basket, so I desisted from
my work, and began to consider how to supply
that want, and make some tools; as for a pick-
axe,
axe, I made use of the iron crows, which were
proper enough, though heavy; but the next
thing was a shovel or spade, this was so absolutely
necessary, that I could do nothing effectually
without it, but what kind of one to make I knew
not.
Nov. 18. The next day in searching the
woods, I found a tree of that wood, or like it,
which in the Brafils they call the iron tree, for,
its exceeding hardness; of this, with great la-
bour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece,
and brought it home too with difficulty enough,
for it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hard-
ness of the wood, and having no other way, made
me a long while upon this machine, for I worked
it effectually, by little and little, into the form of
a Ihoyel or spade, the handle exactly fliaped like
ours in England, only that the broad part having
no iron lhod upon it at bottom, it would not last
nie so long, however, it served well enough for
the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but
never was a shovel, I believe, made after that
fashion, or so long a making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a
wheel-barrow; a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet found
I 3 out;
out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel, but that 1 had no notion
of; neither did I know hpw to go about it; be-
sides, I had no possible way to make the iron gud-
geons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run
in, so I gave it over; and so for carrying away the
earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a
thing like a hod which the labourers carry mor-
tar in when they serve the bricklayers. This was
not so difficult to me as the making the shovel;
and yet this and the Ihovel, and the attempt which
> I made in vain to make a wheel-barrowa took me
up no less than four days, I mean always, except-
ing my morning wjalk with my gun, which I sel-
dom omitted, and very seldom failed also bring-
ing home something fit to eat.
Nov. 23. My other work having now stood
still, because of my making these tools, when
they were finished I went on, and working every
day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent
eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening
ij\y cave, that it might hold my goods commo-
diously,
Note, During all this time, I worked to make
this room or cave spacious enough to accommo-
date me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen,
fri dining-room3 and a cellar; as for my lodging,
I kept
I
I kept to the tent, except that sometimes, In the
wet season of the year, it rained Ib hard, that I
could not keep myself dry, which caused me af-
terwards to cover all my place within m*' pale
with long poles in the form of rasters leaning
against the rock, and load them with flags and
large leaves of trees like a thatch.
Dec 10th. I began now to think my cave or
vault finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell
down from the top and one side, somuch that in sliort
it frighted me, and not without reason too; for if
I had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-
digger; upon this disaster I had a great deal of
work to do over again; for I had the loose earth
to carry out; and which was of more importance,
I had the cieling to prop up, so that I might be
sure that no more would come down.
Dec., 11. This day I went to work with ifr ac-
cordingly, and got two slioarsor posts pitched up-
right to the top, with two pieces of board a-cross
over each post : this I finilhed the next day; and
setting more posts up with boards, in about a
week more I had the roof secured; and the posts
standing in rows, served me for partitions to part
off my house.

Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I
placed shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts
to hang every thing up that could be hung up;
and now I began to be in some ordei: within
doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the
cave, and began to furnilh my house, and set up
some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my
victuals upon, but boards began to be very scarce
with me; also I made me another table.
Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day3
no stirring out.
Dec. 25p Rain all day.
Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler
than before, and pieasanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed an-
other, so a$-th^tt Icatched it, and led it home in
a string; when I had it home, I bound and splin7
tered up its leg which was broke. N. B. I took
such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew
well, and as strong as ever; but by my nursing
it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little
green at my door, and would not go away. This
was the first time that I entertained a thought of
z breeding
breeding up some tame creatures, that I might
have food, when my powder and lhot was all
spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31. Great heats and no
breeze; so that there was no stirring abroad,
except in the evening for food; this time I
spent, in putting all my things in order within
doors.
January i. Very hot still, but I went abroad
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the day; this evening, going farther
into the valleys, which lay towards the center of
the island, I found there was plenty of goats,
though exceeding lhy, and hard to come at;
however I resolved to try, if I could not bring
my dog to hunt them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went
out with my dog, and set him upon the goats,
but I was mistaken, for they all faced about up-
on the dog, and he knew his danger too well, for
he would not come near them.
Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, be-
ing still jealous of my being attacked by some-
body, I resolved to make very thick and strong.
N.B. This
ADVENTURES OF
N. B. This wall being described before, I pur*
posely omit what was said, in the journal; it is
sufficient to observe, that I was no less time, than
from the 3d of January, to the 14th of April,
working, finishing, and perfecting this wall,
though it was no more than about 24 yards in
length, being a half circle, from one place in
the rock, to another place, about twelve yards
from it, the door of the cave being in the center
behind it.
All this time I worked vefy hard, the rains
hindning me^many days, nay sometimes, weeks
together; but I thought I should never be per*
fectly secure, till this wall was finished; and it is
scarce credible, what inexpressible labour every
thing was done with ; especially the bringing piles
,out of the woods, and driving them into the
ground, for I made them much bigger than I
, needed to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside
double fenced, with a ttirf wall raised up close to
it, I persuaded myself, that if any people werei
to come on shore there, they would hot perceive
any thing like a habitation; and it was very well
I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a
very remarkable occasion*
During
During this time, I made my rounds in the
woods for game, every day, when the rain ad-
mitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these
walks, of something or other to my advantage;
particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons,
who build, not as wood pigeons in a tree, but
rather as house pigeons, in the holes of the
rocks; and taking some young ones, I endea-
voured-to breed them up tame, and partly did so;
but some died, and the rest, as they grew older,
flew away, which perhaps was at first for want
of feeding them, for I had little 01 nothing to
give them; however, I frequently found their
nests, and got their young ones, which was very
good meat. And now, in the managing my
houstiold affairs, I found myself wanting many
things, which I thought at first it was impossi-
ble for me to make, as indeed as to some of
them it was; for instance, I could never make a
calk to be hooped; I had a small runlet or two,
as I Observed before, but I could never arrive to
the capacity of making one by therr\, though I
spent many weeks about it ; I could neither put
in the heads, or join the staves so true to one an-
other, as to make them hold water, so I gave that
also oven In the next place, I was at a great loss
for candle,, so that as soon as ever it was dark,
which was generally by seven o'clock, I was
obliged to go to bed : I remembered the lump of
bees-
bees-wax, with which I made candles in my Af-
rican adventure, but I had none of that now; the
only remedy I had was, that when I had killed
a goat, I saved the tallow, and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the.sun, to
which I added a wick of some oakum, I made-
me a lamp, and this gave me a light, though not
a clear steady light like a candle; in the middle
of all my labours it, happened, that rum'niaging
my things, I found a little bag, which, as I ^
hinted before, had been filled with corn, for the
feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but be-
fore, as I suppose, when the snip came from
Lisbon : what little remainder of corn had been in
the bag, was all devoured with the rats, and I
saw nothing in the bag but hulks and dust; and
being willing to have the bag for'some other use,
I think it was to put powder in, when I divided
it for fear of the lightning, or some such use, I
fliookthe hufksof corn out of it, on one side of
my fortification under the rock.
It was a little before tfie great rain, just now
mentioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking
no notice of any thing, and not so much as re-
membering that I had th'rown any thing there;
when about a month after, or thereabout, I saw
some few stalks of something -green, shooting out
of the ground, which I fancied might be some
plant
plant I had not seen, but I was surprized and per-
fectly astonished, when, after a little longer time,
I saw about ten or twelve ears come,out, which
were perfect green barley, of the fame kind as our
European, nay, as our English barley.
It is impossible to express my astonishment and
confusion of thoughts on this occasion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all,
indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my
head, or had entertained any fense of any thing
that had befiallen me, otherwise than as a chance,
or as we lightly fay, what pleases God, with-
out so much as enquiring into the erid of provi-
dence, in these things, or his order in governing
events in the world: but after I saw barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper
for corn, and especially that I knew not how it
came there, it startled me strangely, and I began
to suggest, that God had miraculously caused this
grain to grow, without any help of feed sown,
and that it was so directed purely for my suste-
nance, on that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought
tears out of my eyes; and I began to bless myself,
that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon
my account ; and this was more strange to me,
because I saw near it still, all along by the sideof.
the
A D V E N ? V R t S OF
the rock, some other straggling stalks, which
proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew,
because I had seen it grow in Africa* when I was
ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions
of providence for my support, but not doubting,
but that there was more in the place, I went over
all that part of the island, where I had been be-
fore, peeping in every corner, and under every
rock, to fee more of it, but I could not find any;.
at last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had
ihook a bag of chickens meat out in that place,
and then the wonder began to cease; and I must
confess, my religious thankfulness to God's pro-
vidence began to abate too, upon the discovering
that all was nothing, but what was common;
though I ought to have been as thankful for so
strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had
been miraculous: for it was really the work of
* providence, as to me, that Ihould order or ap-
point, that 10 or 12 grains of corn should remain
unspoiled, (when the rats had destroyed all the
rest), as if it had been dropt from heaven; as
also, that I should throw it out in that particular;
place, where it being in the sliade of a high rock,
it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had
thrown it any where else, at that time, it had
been burnt up and destroyed.
I CARE-
I carefully saved the ears of corn you may be
sure in their season, which was about the end of
June; and laying up every corn, I resolved to
sow them all again, hoping in time, to have
some quantity sufficient to supply me with bread;
but it was not till the 4th year, that I could al-
low myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and
even then but sparingly, as I shall shew after-
wards in its order; for I lost my sowing the first
season, by not observing the proper time; for I
sowed just before the dry season, so that it never
rightly came up at all, of which in its place.
Besides this barley, there was, as above, 20
or 30 stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the fame kind, or
to the fame purpose, viz. to make me bread, or
rather food; for I found ways to cook it up with-
out baking, though I did that also after some
time. But to return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four
months to get my wall done, and the 14th of
April I closed it up, contriving to get into it, not
by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that
there might be no sign in the outside of my habi-
tation.
April
ADVENTURES OF
April i 6. I finished the ladder, so 1 went up
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up
after me, and let it down in the inside; this
was a compleat enclosure to me$ for within I
had room enough, and nothing could come at
me from without, unless it first mounted my
wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished,
I had almost had all my labour overthrown at
once, and myself killed; the case was thus: as
I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just *
in the entrance into my cave, I was terribly
frightened with a most dreadful surprising thing
indeed; for all on a sudden, I found the earth
come crumbling down from the roof of my cave,
and from the edge of the hill over my head, and
two of the posts I had set up in the cave, cracked
in a frightful manner; I was heartily scared, but
thought of nothing that was really the cause, on-
ly thinking that the top of my cave was falling in,
as some of it had done before, and for fear I
should be buried in it, I ran forward to my lad-
der, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I
got over my wall, for fear of the pieces of the hill
which I expected might roll down upon me; I
was no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground,
but I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for
the ground I stood on shook three times at eight
minutes
minutes distance, with thr'fce such shocks, as would
have overturned the strongest building that could
be supposed td have stood on the earth; and a
great piece of the top of a rock which stood about
half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down
with such a terrible noise, as 1 never heard in
all my life. I perceived also, that the very sea
was put into a violent motion by it; and I believe
the stiocks were stronger under the water, than in
the island;
I was so much amazed with the thing itself,
having never felt the like, or discoursed with
any one that had; that I was like one dead or stu-
pified; and the motion of the earth niade my
stomach sick like one that was tossed at sea; but
the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me
as it were, and rousing me from the stupified con-
dition I was in^ silled me with horror, and I
thought of nothing but the hill falling upori
my tent and all my houihold goods, and burying
all at once; and this funk my very soul within
me a second time.
After the third stioefc was over, and I felt no
inore for some time, I began to take courage,
knd yet I had not heart enough to go over my
ivall again, for fear of being buried alive, but
fat still upon the ground, greatly cast down, and,
^ol. n K discon-
disconsolate,notknowingwhattodo. AH this while*
1 had not the least serious religious thought, no-
thing but the common, (Lord, have mercy up-
on me); and when it was over, that went away
too.
While I fat thus, I found the air overcast, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that,
the wind rose by little and little, so that, in less
than half an hour, it blew a most dreadful hurri-
cane: the sea was, all on a sudden, covered with
foam and froth, the shore was covered with a
breach of the water, the trees were torn up by
the roots, and a terrible storm if was. And this
held about three hours, and then began to abate;
and in two hours more it was stark calm, and be-
gan to rain very hard. All this while I fat upon
the ground very much terrified and dejected,
when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that
these winds and rain being the consequence of the
earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and
over, and I might venture into my cave again.
With this thought my spirits began to revive,
and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went
in and sat down upon my tent; but the rain was
so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
down with it, and I was forced to get into my
cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for
feat it should fall on my head. This violent rain
4 ( forced
forced me to a new work, viz. to cut a hole
through my new fortification, like a sink, to let
the water go out, which would else have drowned
my cave. After I had been in my cave some
time, and found still no more shocks of the earth-
quake follow, I began to be more composed.
And, now to support my spirits, which, indeed,
wanted it very much, I went to my little storey
and took a small sup of rum, which however I
did then and always very sparingly, knowing
I could have no more when that was gone. It
continued raining all that night, and great part
of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad j
but my mind being more composed, I began to
think of what I had best do, concluding, that
if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a cave, but I
must consider of building me some littlfe hut in
an opeii place, which I might surround with a
wall, as I had done here, and so make myself
secure from wild beasts or men: but concluded,
if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one;
time dr others be buried alive:
With these thoughts, I resolved to remove
by tent from the place where it stood, which
"was just under the hanging precipice of the hill,
and which, if it should be shaken again, would
Certainly fall into my tent. And I spent the two
K ?. ftext
next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in
contriving where and how to remove my habita-
tion. The fear of being-swallowed up alive
affected me so, that I never slept in quiet; and yet
the apprehensions of lying abroad, without any
fence, was almost equal to it: but still, when I
looked about, and law how every thing was put
in order, how pleasantly I was concealed, and how
safe from danger, it made me very loth to re-
move. In the mean timeit occurred to me, that
it would require a vast deal of time for me to do
this, and that I must be contented to run the
venture where I was, till I had formed a camp
for myself, and had secured it so as to remove to
it. So with this resolution I composed myself for a
rime, and resolved I would go to work with all
speed to build me a wall with piles and cables,
&c. in a circle as before, and set my tent up in it
when it was finished, but that I would venture to
stay where I was till it was finished, and fit to re-
move to. This was the 21st.
April 22. The next morning I began to con-
sider of means to put this resolve into execution,
but I was at a great loss about my tools; I had
three large axes and abundance of hatchets, (for
we carried the hatchets for traffic with the In-
dians) but with much chopping and cutting
knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches
and
and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I could
not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost
me as much thought as a statesman would have
bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a
judge upon the life and death of a man* Ac
length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn
it with my foot, that I might have both my hands
at liberty. Note, I had" never seen any such
thing in England, or at least not to take notice
how it was done, though since I have observed it
is very common there: besides that, my grind
stone was very large and heavy. Tl^is machine
cost me a fulhweek's work to bring it to perfec-
tion.
Afril a8, 29. These two whole days 1 took
\ip in grinding my tools, my machine for turn-
ing my grindstone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had
been low a great while^ now I took a survey of
it, and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a day,
which made my heart very heavy.
May 1. . In the morning, looking towards the
sea-side, the tide beinglow, I saw something lie
on the stiore bigger than ordinary, and it looked
like a cask; when I came to it, I found a small
barrel, and two or three pieces^of the wreck of
K 3 the
the ship, which were driven on shore by the late
hurricane, and looking towards the place where
the wreck lay, I found it appeared again up
above the water. I examined the barrel that was
driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel
of gunpowder, but it had taken water, and the
powder was caked as hard as a stone; however, I
rolled it farther on the shore for the present, and
went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the
wreck of the ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it
strangely removed; the forecastle, which lay be-
fore buried in sand, was heaved up at least six
feet; and the stern, which was broke to pieces
and .parted from the rest by the force of the sea,
soon after I left rummaging her, was tossed, as it
were, up, and cast on one side, arid the sand was
thrown so high on that side next her stern, that
whereas there was fca. great piece of water before,
so that I could not come within a quarter of a
mile of the wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out.
I was surprized with this at first, but soon con-
cluded it must be done by the earthquake; and
as by this violence the ship was more broke open
than formerly, so many things came daily on
shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the
winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.
This
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the
design of removing my habitation; and I busied
myself mightily, that day especially, in searching
whether I could make any way into the ship; but
I found nothing was to be expected of that kind,
for that all the inside of the ship was choaked up
with sand: however, as I had learned not to de-
spair of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing
to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding
that .every thing I could ,get from her would be
of some use or other to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece
of a beam through, which I thought held some
of the upper .part or.quarter-deck together, and
when I had cut through, I cleared away the sand
as well as I could from the fide which lay high-
est; but the tide coming in, I wras obliged to give
over for that time*
May 4. I went a sifting, but caught not one
fish that I, durst'eat of, till I was weary of my
sport; when, just going to leave off, I caught
a young dolphin. I had made me a long line
of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks, yet
I frequently caught fisli enough, as much as I
reared to eat; .all which I dried in the fun, and
eat them dry.
May
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another
beam asunder, and brought three great fir-planks
off from the decks, which I tied together, and
made swim on shore when the tide of flood came
on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several
iron bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron
work, worked very hard, and cariie hpme very
much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with
an intent not to work again, but found the weight
of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams
being cut; that several pieces of the ship seemed
to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so
open that I could see into it, but almost full of
water and sand.
*
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an
iron crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now
quite clear of the water and sand. I wrenched
up two planks, ai)d brought them on shore also
with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck
for next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the
crow made way into the body of the wreck, and
felt several calks, and loosened them with the
crow, but could not break them up. I felt also a
'™ll
roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was
too heavy to remove.
May 10, to 14. Went every day to the wreck,
and got a great deal of pieces of timber, and
boards, or plank, and 2 or 300 weight of iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I
could not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by pla-
cing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with
the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half
in the water, I could not make any blow to drive
the hatchet.
Majt 16. It had blown hard in the night, and
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of
the water; but I staid so long in the woods to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my
going to the wreck that day.
May 17. 1 saw some pieces of the wreck
blown on ihore, at a great distance, near two
rniles off me, but resolved to see what they were,
and found it was a piece of the head, but too
heavy for me to bring away.
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on
jtfte wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some
things so much with the crow, that the first blow-
ing
ing tid^e several ca&s floated out, and two of the
seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces
of timber, and a hogshead which had fomeBrasil
pork in it, but the salt water and the sand had
spoiled it. I continued this work every day to
the 15th of June, except the time neceffary to
get food, which I always appointed, during this
part of my employment, to be when the tide was
lip, that I might be ready when it ebbed out;
a;nd by this time I had gotten timber, and plank,
and iron work enough to have built a good boat,
if I had known how: and also, I had got several
times, and in several pieces, near 100 weight of
the sheet lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea fide I found
a large tortoise or turtle. This was the first I had
seen, which it seems was only my misfortune, not
any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I
happened to be on the other side of the island, I
might have had hundreds of them every day, as I
found afterwards; but, perhaps, had paid dear
enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I
found in her threescore eggs, and her £Jeih was to
me, at that time, the most savoury and pleasant
that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh,
but
but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this hor-
jrid place.
June 18. Rained all day, and I staid within.
J thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I
was something chilly, which I knew was not vi-
sual in that latitude,
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the^
weather had been cold.
June 20. No rest at all, violent pains in my
head, and feverish,
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death
with the apprehensions of my fad condition, to
be sick, and no help : prayed to God for the first
time since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew
what I said or why; my thoughts being all con-
fused.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful
apprehensions of sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and stiivering,
and then a violent head-ach.
June 24. Much better.
June
June 25. An ague very violent; the sit held
me seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats
after it.
June 26. Better; and having no victuals to
eat, took my gun, but found myself very weak:
however, I killed a she-goat, and with much dif-
ficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and
eat; I would fain have stewed it, and made some
broth, but had no pot.
JuNfc 27. The ague again so violent, that I
lay a-bed all day with weakness, and neither eat
or drank, though I was ready to perish for thirst.
Prayed to God again, but was light-headed, and
when I was not, I was so ignorant, that I knew
not what to fay, only I lay and cryed, Lord look
upon me, Lord pity me, Lord have mercy upon
me: I suppose I did nothing else for two or three
hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and
did not awake till far in the night; when I a-
woke, I found my self much refreshed, but weak,
and exceeding thirsty: however, as I had no
water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie
till morning, and went to sleep again; in this
second sleep, I had a terrible dream; I thought
that I was sitting on the ground on the outside of
my wall, where I fat when the storm "blew after
the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from
from a great. black cloud, in a bright-flame of
fire, and light upon the ground; he was all over
as bright as a flame, so that I could just bear to
look towards him; his countenance was most in-
expressibly dreadful, impossible for words to de-
scribe ; when he stepped upon the ground with his
feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it did
before the earthquake, and all the air looked,, to
my apprehension, as if it had been filled with
flalhe-s of fire: he no sooner landed upon the
earth, but he moved forward towards me, with
a long spear or weapon in his hand to kill me;
and when he came to a rising ground, at some
distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so
terrible, that it is impossible to express the terror
of it: all that I can fay I understood, was this:
Seeing all these things have not brought thee to
repentance, now thou shalt die; at which words,
I thought he lifted up the spear in his hand to
kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will
expect that I should be able to describe the hor*
rorsof my soul at this terrible vision; I mean,
that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed
of those horrors; nor is it any more possible to
describe the impression that remained upon mv
mind when I awaked and sound it was but a
dream.
I HAD
I jud, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had
received by the good instruction of my father
was then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for
eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a con-
stant conversatidn with nothing but such a3 were
like myself, wicked and profane: I do not re-
member, that I had, in all that time, one thought
that so much as tended, either to looking up-
wards toward God, or inward towards a reflection
upon my own ways* But a certain stupidity
of soul, without desire of good, or conscious of
evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, and I was all
that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked
creature among our common sailors, can be sup-
posed to be, not having the least sense, either of
the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to
God in deliverances*
In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I
lhall add, that through all the variety of miseries
that had to this day befallen me, I never had so
much* as one thought of it being the hand of
God, or that it was a just punishment for my fin;
my rebellious behaviour against my father, or my
present fins, which were great, or so much as ^t-
punishmeirt for the general course of my wicked
life. When I was on the desperate expedition on
the desart shores of Africa, I never had so much
*43
as one thought of what would become of me, or
one wisti to God to direct me whither I should go,
or to keep me from the danger which apparently-
surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures
as cruel savages; but I was merely thoughtless
of al God, or a providence; acted like a mere
brute from the principles of nature, and by the
dictates of common fense only, and indeed hardly
that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea
by the. Portugal Captain, well used, and dealt
justly and honourably with, as well as charitably,
I had not the least thankfulness on my thoughts.
When again I was shipwrecked, and in danger of
drowning on this island, I was as far froilv re-
morse, or looking on it as a judgment; I only
said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate
dog, and born to be always miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and
found all my {hip's crew drowned, and myself
spared, I was surprized with a kind of extasy, and
some transports of foul, which, had the Grace of
God assisted, might have come up to true thank-
fulness.; but it ended where it began, in a mere
common flight'of joy; or, as I may fay, being
glad I was alive, without the least reflection upon
the distinguisliing goodness of the hand which
had preserved me, and had singled me out to be
preserved, when all the rest were destroyed; or
ADVENTURES OF
an enquiry why Providence had been thus mer-
ciful to me; even just the fame common fort of
joy, which seamen generally have, after they are
got safe ashore from a ihipwrecky which they
drown all in the next bowl of punch,' and forget
almost as soon as it is over : and all the rest of my
life was like it. Even when I was- afterwards, oii
due consideration, made sensible of my conditions
how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the
reach of human kind, out of all hope of reliefs
or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw but
a prospect of living, and that I should not starve
arid perish, for hunger, all the sense of my afflic-
tion wore off, and I began to be very easy, ap^
plied myself to the works proper for rfiy preserva-
tion and supply, and was far enough from being
afflicted at my condition, as a judgement from
heaven, or the hand of God against me. These
were thoughts which very seldom entered into-
my head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in
my journal, had, .at first, some little influence
upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness,
as Fdng as I thought it had something miracu-
lous in it; but as soon as ever that part of the
thought was removed, all the impression, which
was raised from it, wore off also, as I have noted:
already, Even the earthquake, though no-
thing
*45
thing could be more terrible in its nature, or
more immediately directing to the inviliblePower
which alone directs such things, yet no sooner
was the first fright over, but the impression it had
made went off also., I had no more sense of God,
or his judgments, much less of the present
affliction of my circumstances being from his
hand, than if I had been .in the most prosperous
condition of life. But now, when I began to be
lick, and a leisure view of the miseries of death
came to place itself before me; when my spirits
began to sink under the burden of a strong dis-
temper, and nature was exhausted with the vio-
lence of the fever, conscience, that had slept so
long, began to awake, and I began to reproach
myself with my past life, in which I had so evi-
dently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes,
aiad to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.
These reflections oppressed me for the second or
third day of my distemper, and in the violence,
as well of the fever, as of the dreadful reproaches
of my conscience, extorted some words from me
like praying to God, though I cannot fay they
were either a prayer attended with desires or with
hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and
distress; my thoughts were confused, the con-
victions great upon my mind; and the horror of
dying, in such a miserable condition, raised va-
vol. i. L pours
ADVENTtfRES OF
pours in my head with the mere apprehensions |
and, in these hurries of my foul, I knew not what
my tongue might express, but it was rather ex-
clamation, such as, " Lord, what a miserable
"creature am I!" If I should be sick, I shall
c5 certainly die for want of help, and what will
"become of me?" Then the tears burst out of
my eyes, and I could fay no more for a good
while.- In this interval the good advice of my
father came to my mind, and presently his pre-
diction, which I mentioned at the beginning of
this story, viz. That if I did take this foolish
step, God would not bless me, and I would have
leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected
his counsel, when these might be none to assist
in my recovery, "Now," said I aloud, <c my
"dear father's words are cofne to pass; God's
(c justice has overtaken me, and I have none to
"help or hear me* Trejected the voice of P%p-
"vidence, which had mercifully put me in a
"posture or station of life wherein I might have
"been happy and easy, but I vyould neither see
'* it myself, or learn to know the blessing' of it
<c from my parents. I left them to mourn over
"my folly, and now I am left to mourn under
"the consequences of it. I refused their help
"and assistance who would have lifted me into
"the world, and would have made every thing
"easy to me, and now I have difficulties to

cc strugg^e to° great for even nature itself to

the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had
made for many years* But I return to my jour*
hal.
June i8; fiavirig been somewhat refreshed
with the sleep I got, and the fit being entirely off,
X got up; and though the fright and terror of my
dre&m was very great* yet I considered, that the
fit of the ague would return again the next day>
and now was my time to get something to refresh,
and support myself when I stiould be ill; and the
first thing I did, I filled a large square case bottle
with water, and set it upon my table, in reach
of my bed; and to take off the chill, or aguifli
disposition of t\\6 water, I put about a quarter of
a pint of rum into it, and mixed them together *
then I got me a piece of the goat's flefli, and
broiled it on th6 coals* but could eat very little.
I walked about, but was very weak, and withal
Very fad and heavy-hearted in the fense of my
hiisefable condition* dreading" the return of my
distemper the next day. At night I made my
supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I
toasted in the alhes, and eat, as we call it, in the
stiell; and this was the first bit of meat I had
L a ever
ever asleed God's blessing to, that, as I could re-
member, in my whole life. After I had eaten, I
tried to walk, but found myself so weak that I
could hardly carry the gun, (for I never went
without that) so I went but a little way, and sat
down upon the ground, looking out upon the sea>
which was just before me, and very calm and
smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as
these occurred to me: What is this earth and sea,
of which I have seen so much? Whence is it
produced? And what am I, and all the othef
creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal?
Whence are we? Surely, we are all made by
some sacred power, who formed the earth, the
sea, the air, and Iky- And who is that? Then
it followed most naturally, it is God that has
made it all, Well., but theft it came on strangely,
if God has made all these things, he guides and
governs them all, and all things that concern
them; for the power, that could make all things,
must certainly have power to .direct them. If
so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his
works, either without his knowledge or appoint-
ment.
And if nothing happens without his know-
ledge, he knows that I am here, and am in this
dreadful condition: and if nothing happens
without his appointment, he has appointed all
'this
this to befal me. Nothing occurred to my
thought to contradict any of these conclusions,
. and therefore it rested upon me with the greatest
force, that it must needs be, that God had ap-
pointed all this to befal me; that I was brought
to this miserable circumstance by his direction,
he having the sole power, not of me only, but of
every thing that happened in the world. Imme-
diately it followed, 66 why has God done this to
"me? what have I done to be thus used V9 My
conscience presently checked me in that enquiry,
as if I had blasphemed; and methought it spoke
to me like a voice, "WRETCH! do thou ask
"what thou hast done? Look back upon a
"dreadful mispent life, and ask thyself, what
"thou hast not done? Why is it that thou wert
"not long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not
c< drowned in Yarmouth Roads? Killed in
"the fight when the ship was taken by
« the Sallee man of war? Devoured by the
"wild beasts on the coast of Africa? Or drown-
<c ed HERE, when all the crew perislied but
"thyself? Dost thou ask, what have I done?"
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one
astonished, and had not a word to fay; no, not to
answer for myself; but rising up pensive and sad,
walked back to my retreat, and went over my
wall, as if I had been going to bed, but my
thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no in-
L 3 clination
clination to sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and
lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now
as the apprehension of the return of my distem-s
per terrified me very much, it occurred to my
thought, that the Brazilians take no physic but
their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I
had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one pf the
phests, which was quite cured, and fame also that
was green and not quite curecl.
I went directed by heaven no doubt; for in
this chest I found a cure both for foul an4 body,
I opened the chest, and found what I looked for,
viz. the tobacco; and as the few books I had
saved, lay there too, I took out one of the bibles
which I mentioned before, and which to this time
I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination
to look into; I fay, I took it out, and brought
both that and the tobacco with me to the table,
What use to make of the tobacco, I knew not,
as to my distemper, or whether it was good for
;ne or not; but I tried several experiments with
it, as if I was resolved it Ihould hit pne way or
Other; I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed
it in my mouth, which indeed almost stupified
my brain, the tobacco being green and strong,
and that I had not been used to it; then I took
some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum,
and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down;
and
and lastly, I burnt some upon a pa'n of coals, and
held my nose close over the smoke of it as long
as I could bear it. In the interval of this ope-
ration I took up the bible and began to read, but
my head was too much disturbed with the to-
bacco to bear reading, at least that time; only
having opened the book casually, the first words
that occurred to me were these, " Call on me in
"the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
"thou shalt glorify me." The words were very
apt to my cafe, and made some impression upon
my thoughts at the time of reading them, though
not so much as they did afterwards; for, as be-
ing delivered, the word had no sound, as I may
fay, to me; the thing was so remote, so impossi-
ble in my apprehension of things, that I began
to fay as the children of Israel did, when they were
promised flefli to eat, " Can God spread a table in
"the wilderness " so "I began to fay, can God
himself deliver me from this place; and as it was
not for many years that any hopes appeared, this
prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but,
however, the words made a great impression upon
me, and I mused upon them very often. It grew
now late, and the tabacco had, as I said, dozed
my head so much, that I inclined to sleep; so I
left4 my lamp burning in the cave, lest I sliould
want aijiy thing in the night, and went to bed;
but before I laid down, I did what I never had
L 4 dpne
done in all my life, I kneeled down and prayed
to God to fulfil the promise to me, " that if I
€C called upon him in the day of trouble he
<f would deliver me;" after my broken and im-
perfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which
I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong
and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could
scarce get it down; immediately upon this I went
to bed; I found presently it flew up in my head
violently, but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked
no more till by the sun it must necessarily be near
three o'clock in the afternoon the next day; nay,
to this hour, I am partly of opinion, that I slept
all the next day and night, and till almost three that
day after; for otherwise I know not how I sliould
lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of
the week, as it appeared some years after I had
done; for if I had lost it by crossing and re-cros-
sing the line, I stiould have lost more than one
day; but certainly I lost a day in my account,
and never knew which way. Be that, however,
one way or the other, when I awaked I found my-
self exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively
and chearful; when I got up I was stronger than
I was the day before, and my stomach better,
for I was hungry ; and in sliort, I had no fit the
next day, but continued much altered for the bet-
ter: This was the 29th,
The
The 30th was my well day of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel
too far; I killed a sea fowl or two, something
like a br4nd goose, and brought them home, but
was ndt very forward to eat them; so I eat some
more of my turtle's eggs, which were very good.
This evening I renewed the medicine, which I
had supposed did me good the day before, viz.
the tobacco steeped in rum, only I did not take
so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf,
or hold my head over the smoke; however I was
not so well the next day, which was the 1st of
July, as I hoped I should have been, for I had
a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dozed myself with it as at first, and
doubled the quantity which I drank.
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks
after: while I was thus gathering strength my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scripture, " I
"will deliver thee," and the impossibility of my
deliverance lay much upon my mind in bar of
my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging
myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind,
that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the
main affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance
I had
ADVENTURES OK
I had received; and I was, as it were, made to
alk myself such questions as these, viz. " Have
"I not been delivered, and wonderfully too,
"from sickness, from the most distressed condi-
"tion that could be, and that was so frightful to
€€ me; and what notice had I taken of it? Had
4C I done my part, God had delivered me, but I
"had not glorified him; that is td fay, I had not
€C owned and been thankful for that as a deliver-
u ance, and how could I expect a greater deli-
fC t verance?" This touched my heart very much,
and immediately I kneeled down and gave God
thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness,
July 4. In the morning I took the bible, and
beginning at the new testament, I began seriously
- to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a
while every morning and every night, not tying
myself to the number of chapters, but as long as
my thoughts fliould engage me: It was not long
after I set scrioysly to this work, but I found my
heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the
wickedness of my past life. The impression of
, the dream revived, and the words, " all these
"things have not brought thee to repentance,"
ran seriously in my thoughts: I was earnestly
begging of God to give me repentance, when it
happened providentially the very next day that
leading the scripture, I came to these words,
<( He is exalted a prinqe and a saviour, to
** give repentance, and to give remission."
I threw down the book, and with my heart as well
as my hands lifted to heaven, in a kind of ex-
tacy of joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou son
"of David, Jesus thou exalted prince and saviour,
** give me repentance V\ This was the first time
that I could fay, in the true fense of the word's,
that I prayed in all my life;, for now I prayed
with a fense of mv condition, and with a true
scripture view of hope, founded on the encou-
ragement of the word of God; and from this
time, I may fay, I began to have hope that God
would hear me,
Now I began to construe the words mention-
ed above, <* Call on me, and I will deliver you,"
in a different fense from what I had ever done be-
fore; for then I had no notion of any thing be-
ing called deliverance, but my being delivered
from the captivity I was in; for though I was
indeed at large in the place, yet the island
was certainly a prison to me, and that in the
worst fense in the world; but now I learned to
take it in another fense : Now I looked back upr
on my past. Yifd with such horror, and my sins
appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought no-
thing of God, but deliverance from the load of
guilt that bore down all my comfort: as for my
soli-
solitary life, it was nothing, I did not so much as
pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it
was all of no consideration in comparison to this:
And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall
read it, that whenever they come to a true fense
of things, they will find deliverance from sin, a
much greater blessing, than deliverance from af-
fliction. But leaving this part, I return to my
journal.
My condition began now, to be much easier to
my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a
constant reading the scripture, and praying to'
God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which till now, I knew
nothing of; also, as my health and strength re-
turned, I bestirred myself to furnish myself with
every thing that I wanted, and make my way
of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sick-
ness: for it is hardly to be imagined how low I
was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The
application which I made use of was perfectly
new, and perhaps what had never cured an ague
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to
practise,
practise, by this experiment; and though it did
carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weak-
ening me; for I had frequent convulsions in my
nerves and limbs for some time. I learned from
it also this in particular, that being abroad in the
rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my
health that could be, especially in those rains
which carrte attended with storms and hurricanes
of wind $ for as the rain which came in the dry
season was most always accompanied with such
storms, so I found that this rain was much more
dangerous than the rain which fell in September
and October* I had now been in this unhappy
island above ten months, all possibility of deliver-
ance from this condition, seeming to be entirely
taken from me and I firmly believed, that no
human shape had ever set foot upon that place.
Having now secured my habitation, as I thought,
fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a
more perfect discovery of the island, and to see
what other productions I might find, which Iyer
Jknew nothing of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular survey of the island itself: I
went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I
brought my rafts on shore; I found after I came
about two miles up that the tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little brook
of
of running water, very frefli and good; but ting
being the dry season, there was hardly any water
in some parts of it, at least not any firearm On
the banks of this brook I found many pleasant
savanahs,or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass; and on the rising parts of them next
to the higher grounds, where the water, as it
might be 'supposed, never overflowed, I found
tobacco (though wild) green, and growing to a
great and very strong stalk; and there were di-
vers other plants which I had no knowledge or
notion of* I searched for the cassava root, which
the Indians in that climate tnake their bread of,
but I could find none. I saw large plants of
aloes, but did not understand them. I saw seve-
ral sugar canes, but wild, and for want of culti-
vation, imperfect* I contented myself with these
discoveries for this time, and came back musing
with myself, what course I might take td know
the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or
plants which I should discover; but could bring
it to no conclusion; for in stiort, I had made so
little observation while I was in the Brafils, that
I knew little of the plants in the field, at least
very little that might serve me any purpose now
in my distress*
The next day, the i6t'li, I went up the fames
way again, and after gtfing something farther
than
ftqkiNSOtt cruso£< 159
than I had gone the day before, I found the brook
and the favanahs began to cease, and the country
became more woody than before. In this part
1 found different fruits, and particularly I found
melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread in-
deed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes
were just now in their prime'^ very ripe and,rich*
This was a surprizing discovery, and I was ex-
ceedingly glad of them; but I was warned by my
experience to eat sparingly of them, remember^
ing that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating
of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who
were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes
and fevers; bqt I found an excellent use for these
grapes, and that was to cilre or dry them in the
fun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are
kept, which I thought.would be, as indeed they
were, as wholesome as agreeable to eat, when no
grapes might be to be had* I spent all that even-
ing there, and went back to my habitation, which
by the way was the first night, as I might fay I
had lain from home. In the night I took my first
contrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept
well, and the next morning proceeding upon my
discovery, travellingnearfour miles, I might judge
by the length of the valley, keeping still due north,
with a ridge of hills on the south and north sides
of me. At the end of this march I came to an
open-
openiiigj where the country seemed to descend to
the west, and a little spring of freshwater which
issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran'the
other way* that is due east; and the country appeared
so fresh, so green, so flourilhing, everything being
in a constant verdure, or flourish of spring, that it
looked like a planted garden. I descended a little
on the side of that delicious Vale, surveying it with
a secret kind of pleasure (tho' mix'd with my other
afflicting thoughts) to think that this was all my
own, that I was king and lord of all this country
indefeasibly, and had a right of possession; and if I
could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as
completely as any lord of amanor in England. I saw
here abundance of cocoa trees, orange and lemony
and citron trees, but all wild, and very few bearing
any fruit, at least not then. However, the green
limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat,
but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice after-
wards with water, which made it very wholfome,
and very cool and refrefliing. < I found now I had
business enough to gather and carry home, and I
refolv'd to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes
and lemons, to furntfh myself for the wet season,
which I knew was approaching. In order to which
I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, and
a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of
limes and melons in another place; and taking a
few of each with me I travelled homeward, and re-
solved
solved to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or
what I could make to carry the rest home. Ac-
cordingly, having spent three days in this journey,
I came home, so I must now call my tent and my
cave, but before I got thither the grapes were spoiled,
the richness of the fruits and the weight of the juice
having broken them and bruised them, they were
good for little or nothing; as to the limes,they were
good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, hav-
ing made rrie two small bags to bring home my har-
vest; but I was surprized when coming to my heap
of grapes,which were so rich and fine when I gathered
them, I found them all spread abouty trod to pieces,
and dragged about, some here, some there, and abun-
dance eaten and devoured: By this I concluded their
were some wild creatures thereabouts which had
done this, but what they were I knew not. How-
ever, as I found there was no laying them up on
heaps, and no carrying them away in a lack, but
that one way they would be destroyed, and the
other way they would be crustied with their own
weight, I took another course, for I.gathered a
large quantity of the grapes and hung them upon
the out branches of the trees, that they might cure
and dry in the fun; and as for the limes, and lemons,
I carried as many back as I could well stand ynder.
M When
e
When I came home from this journey,! contem-
plated with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation, die
security from storms on that side, the water, and the
wood, and concluded that I had pitched upon a place
to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part of
the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of
removing my habitation, and to look out for a
place equally safe as where I was now situate, if
possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was
exceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness
of the place tempting me \ but when I came to a
nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now by
the'sea side, where it was at least possible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage, and by the
same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring
some other unhappy wretches to the fame place;
and tho* it was scarce probable that any such thing
should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among
the hills and woods in the center of the island, was
to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an
affair not only improbable but impossible> and that
therefore I ought not by any means to remove.
However I was so enamoured of this place that, I
spent much of my time there for the whole remain-
ing part of the month of July -> and tho' upon
second thoughts I resolved as above, not to remove,
yet
ygfc 1 built me a little kind of a bower, and surroun-
ded it ata distance with a strong fence^ being a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well stak'd and filled
between with brush-wood; and here I lay very secure,
sometimes two or three nights together, always
goingoter it with a ladder as before; so that I fancy'd
now I had my country-house and my sea-coast-house:
And this work took me up to the beginning of
August.
I had but newly finifh'd my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and made
me stick dole to my first habitation; for tho' I had
made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a fail,
and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of
a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind
me to retreat into, when the rains were extraor-^
dinary;
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finilh'd my bower, and began to enjoy myself.
The 3 d of August I found the grapes I had hung up,
were perfectly dry'd, and were indeed excellent good
raisins of the fun ; so began to take them down
from the trees, and it was very happy that I did
so; for the rains which followed would have spoiled
them, and I had lost the best part of my winter
food j for I had above two hundred large bunches
of .them. No sooner had I taken them all down,
 M 2" - and
and carryed most of them home to my cave, but
it began to rain, and from hence, which was the
fourteenth of August, it rain'd more or less, every
* day, till the middle of October; and fometi mes
so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave
for several days.
. In this season I was much surpriz'd with the in-
crease of my family; I had been concerns for the loss
of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as I
thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tid-
ings of her, till to my astonishment stie came home
about the end of August, with three Kittens ; this
was the more strange to me because tho' I had kill'd
a wild cat, as I call'd it with my gun, yet I thought
it was a quite different kind from our European
cats, yet the young cats were the fame kind of house
breed like the old one; and both of my cats being
females, I thought it very strange: but from these
three cats, I afterwards came to be so pester'd with
cats that I was forced to kill them like vermine, or
/wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as
much as possible.
From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very
careful not to be much wet. In this cohfiftement
I began to be straitened for food, but venturing out
twice, I one clay kilPd a goat, and the last day,
which was the twenty sixth, found a very larg£
tortoise,
tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was
regulated thus; I eat a bunch of raisins for my
breakfast, a piece of the goats flesh, or of the turtle
for my dinner, broil'd • (for to my great misfortune,
1 had no vessel to boil or stew any thing :) and twp
pr three of the turtle's eggs for my supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the
rain, I work'd daily two or three hours at enlarging
my cave, and by degrees work'd it o/i towards one
fide, till I came to the out-side of thehijl, and made a
door pr way out which came beyond my fence or
wall, a,nd so I came in and out this way; but I was
not perfectly easy at lying so open* for as I had
managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure,
•wheseas now I thought I lay expos'd, and open for
any thing to come in upon me; and yet I could
not perceive that there was any living thing to fear,
the biggest creature that I h^d yet seen upon the
island being a goat.
September 30.1 was now come to the unhappy
anniversary of my landing. J cast up the notches
on my post, and found I had been on shore three
hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as
a solemn fast, setting it apart for religious exercise,
prostrating myself on the ground with the most
serious humiliation, confessing my fins to God,
acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me,

and praying to him to have mercy on me thro?
Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least re-
freshment for twelve hours, even till the going
down of the stin, I then ate a biscuit and a bunch
of grapes, and went to bed, finishing die day as I
began it. I had all this time observed no sabbath
day; for as at first I had no fense pf religion upon
my mind, I had after some time omitted to dis-
tinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than
ordinary for the sabbath-day, and so did not mind
what any of the days were; but now having cast up
the days, as above, I found I had been there a year -9
so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every
seventh day fora sabbath; tho' I found at the end
of my account I had lost a day or two in my rec-
koning. A little after this,Jmy ink beginning to fail
me, I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and
to v write down only the most remarkable events of
my life, without continuing a daily memorandum
of the other things.
The rainy season and the dry season began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide
them so as to provide for them accordingly; but
I bought all my experience before I had it, and this
I am going to relate was one pf the most discourag-
ing experiments that I made at all: I have mentioned
that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice,
,which I had so surprizingly found sprung up, as
I thought, of diemselves, and I believe there were
about
about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of
barley; and now I thought it a proper time to low
it after the rains, the lun being in it's southern posi-
tion going from me.
Accordingly I dug a piece of ground as Well
as I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into'two parts, I sow'd my grain; but as I was sowing,
it casually occur'd to my thoughts, that I should not
sow it all kt first, because I did not know when
was the proper time for it; sol sow'd about two
thirds of the feed, leaving about a handful of each.
And 'twas a great comfort to me afterwards, that
I did so, for none of that I sow'd this time came
to any thing: for the dry months following, the
earth having had no rain after the feed was sown,
it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never
came up at all, till the wet season had come again,
and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.
Finding my first feed did not grow, which I easily
imagin'd was by the drought, I sought for a mois-
ter piece of ground to make another trial in, and
I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower,
and sow'd the rest of my seed in February, a little
before the vernal equinox; and this having the
rainy months of March and April to water it, sprung
up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop;
but having part of the seed left only,. and not dar-
ing to sow all that 1 had, I had but a small quan-
M 4 tity #
A D V E N T U R,E S OF
tity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above
half a peck of each kind. But by this experiment
I was made master of my business, and knew exact-
ly when the proper season was to sow j and that I
might expect two seed times, and two harvests every
year, as is usual in that climate*
While this corn was growing, I made a little
discovery, which was of use to me afterwards; as
soon as the rains were over, and the weathtr be-
gan to settle, which was about the month of No-
vember, I made a visit up the Country to my bow-
er, where though I had not been some months, yet
I found all things just as I left them. The circle
or double hedge that I had made, was not only
firm and entire \ but the stakes which I had cut
out of some trees that. grew thereabouts, were all
sliot out and grown with long branches, as much
as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year, but I
could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes
were cut from. I was surpriz'd, and yet very well
pleas'd, to fee die y^ung trees grow, and I prun'd
them and led them up to grow as much alike as I
could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a
figure they grew into in three years; so that though
the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards
in diameter, yet the trees., for such might I now
call them, soon covered it, and it was a compleat
shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.
This
This made me resolve t6 cut some more stakes, and
and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle
round my wall; I mean that of my first dwellings
which I did; and placing the stakes in a double
row, at about eight yards distance from my fence,,
they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover
to my habitation, and afterward jerv'd for a defence
also, as I shall observe in its order.
I found riow that the seasons of the year might
generallybe divided, not into summer and winter,
as in Europe; but into the rainy seasons and the
dry seasons, which were generally thus:
From the middle of Fabruary to the middle of
April, rainy, the fun being then in, or near the
equinox. From the middle of April till the middle
9o( August dry, the fun being then north of the line.
From the middle of August till the middle of Oc-
tober rainy, the fun being then come back to the
line. From the middle of October till the middle
of February dry, the fun being then to the south
of the line*
The rainyseasons held sometimes longer and some-
times shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but
this was the general observation I made: After I
had found by experience, the ill consequence of being
abroad in the rain, 1 took care to furnish myself
with
with provisions beforehand, that I might not be
obliged to go out 5 and I fat within doors as much as
possible during the wet months. This time I found
much employment, (and very suitable also to the
time) for I found great occasion of many things
which I had no way to furnish myself with but by
hard labour and constant application; particularly
I try'd many ways to make myself a basket, but
all the twigs I could get for the purpose prov'd so
brittle, that they would do nothing. Itprov'd
of excellent advantage, to me now, that when I
was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at
a basket-maker's in the town where my father liv'd,
to fee them make their wickervware and being
as boys usually are,very officious to help, and a great
observer of the manner how they work'd those
things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by
this means full knowledge of the methods of it,
that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it
came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree
from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might
possibly be as tough as the sallows and osiers in
England, and I resolv'd to try. Accordingly the
next day I went to my coyntry-houfe, as I call'd
it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs I found
them to my purpose as much as I could desire
whereupon I came the next time prepar'd with a
hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon
sound, for there was great plenty of them: these I
set
set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when
they were fit for use, I carry'd thpni to my cave?
and here during the wet season, I employed myself
in making as well as I could several baskets, both
to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing as I
had occasion; and tho' I did not finish them very
handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently service-
able for my purpose; and thus afterwards I took
care never to be without them -> and as my wicker-
ware decay'd, I made more, especially I made
strong deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of
sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it;
Having master'd this difficulty, and employed
a world of .time about it, I bestirred myself to see
if possible how to supply two wants: I had no ves-
sel to hold any thing that ivas liquid except two
runlets which were almost full of rum, and some
glass bottles, some of the common size, and others
which were case bottles, square, for the holding
of waters, spirits, &c. I had not Ib much as a pot to
boil any thing, except a great kettle, wjiich I saved
out of the ship, and which was too big for such
use as I chiefly desir'd it, (viz.) to make broth
and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing
I would fain have had, wa§ a tobacco-pipe j but it
was impossible for me to makp one, however, I
found a contrivance for that too at last. I em-
ploys myself in planting my second rows offtakes
or
or piles, and in tHi$ wicker working all the slimmer
or dry season, when another business took me up
more time than it could fae imagin'd I could
Jpare.
I mentlOn'd before, that I had 'a great mind
to fee the Whole island, and that I had travell'd up
the broolf, and so on to where I had built my
bower, aAd where I had an opening quite to the
sea on the other side of the island; I nowresolv'd
to travel quite cross to the sea stiore on that side;
so taking my gun, a hatchet and my dog, and a
larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with
two biscuit cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my
pouch for my store, 1 began my journey; when
I had pass'd the vale where iny bower stood as
above, I came within view of the sea, to the west,
and it being a very clear day, I fairly descry'd land
whether an ifla*id or continent, I could not tell;
but it lay very high, extending from die west, to
the W. S. W. at a very great distance; by my
guess it could not be less than 15 or zo leagues
off,
I could not tell what part of the world this
might be, otherWiie then that I knew ^it mitft be
part of America, and as I concluded by all my
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions,
and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where
if
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse
condition than 1 was now; and therefore I ac-
quiesced in the disposition of Providence, which I
began now to own, and to believe, ordered every
thing for the best; I lay, I quieted my mind with
this, and left afflicting myself with.fruitless wishes
of being there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I
considers, that if this land was the Spanisli coast,
I should certainly, one time or other, fee
some vessels pass or repass one way or other; but
if not, then it was the lavage coast between the
Spanish country &nd die Brasils, which are indeed
the worst of savages -> for they are cannibals, and
fail not to murder and devour all the human
bodies that fall into their hands.
With these considerations walking Very lei-
surely forward, I sound the side of the island where
I now was, much plealanter than mine, the open
or Savannah fields sweat, adorned with flowers and
grafs, and full of very fine woods. I law abund-
ance of parrots, and fain I would have caught
one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and
taught it to speak to me. I did, after some
pains, taking, catch a young parrot, for I knock'd
it down with a stick, and having recover'd it,
I brought it home, but it was some years before
I could

I could make him speak :" However, at last i
taught him to call me by my name very fami-
liarly. But the accident that foMbto'd, tho' it
be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place,
I was exceedingly diverted with this jouh^y:
I found in the low grounds hares, as I thought them1
to be* and foxes, but they differ'd greatly from
all the other kinds I had met with; nor cotlld
I satisfy myself to eat them, tho' I kill'd several*
But I had no need to be venturous; for I had'
no want of food, and of that which was very
good too, especially these three sorts, viz. goats,
pigeons, and turtle or tortoise; which added to
my grapes,' Leaden-hall market could not have
furnish'd a table better than I, in proportion to
the company; and tho* my cafe was deplorable
enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness,
and that I was not driven to any extremities for
food i but rather plently, even to dainties.
I never traveled in this journey above two
miles outright in a day, or thereabout; but I
took so many turns and returns, to see what dis-
coveries I could make, that I came weary enough
to the place where I resolv'd to sit down for all
night; and then I either repos'd myself in a tree,
or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set
upright in.the ground,, either from one tree to
4. another*.

another, or so as np wild creature could come at
me, without waking me.
As soon as I came to the fea-lhore, I was fur-
priz'd to see that I had taken up my lot on the
worst side of the island; for here indeed the shore
was cover'd with innumerable turtles, whereas on
the other side I had found but three in a year and a
half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls,
of many kinds, some which I had seen, and some
which I had not seen before, and many of them
very good meat: but such as I knew not the names
of, except those call'd Penguines.
I could have sliot as many as I pleas'd, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot: and therefore
had more mind to kill a siie goat, if I could, which
I could better feed on; and tho' there were manv
goats here, more than on my side the ifland, yer
it was with much more difficulty that I could come
near them, the country being flat and even, and they
saw me much sooner than when I was on the hill.
I confess this side of the country was much piea-
ianter than mine, but yet I had not the least inclina-
tion to remove, for as I was fix'd in my habitation,
it became natural to me, and I seem'd all the while
I was here, to be as it were upon a journey, and from
home: However, I travel?d along the shore of the
sea,
sea, towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles,
and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for
a mark, I concluded I would go home again; and
and that the next journey I took sliould be on the
other side of the island, East from my dwelling,
and so round till I came to my post again ; of which
in its place.
I took another way to come back than that 1
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island
so much in my view, that I could not miss finding
my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I
found myself mistaken; for being come about two
or three miles, I found myself descended into a
very large valley; but so surrounded with hills,
and those hills coverd with wood, that I could not
fee which was my way by any direction but that of
the fun, nor even then, unless I knew very well
the position of the fun at that time of the day.
And it happen'd to my farther misfortune, that
the weather prov'd hazy for three or four days,
while I was in this valley; and not being able to
lee the fun, I wandered about very uncomfort-
ably, and at last was oblig'd to find out the sea-side,,
look for my post, and come back the fame way I
went; and then by easy journies I turn'd homeward,
the weather being exceeding hot, and my gun,
ammunition, hatchet, and other things very heavy.
In
In this journey my dog surpriz'd a young kid,
and seiz'd upon it, and I running in to take hold
of it, caught it and sav'd it alive from the dog: I
had a great mind to bring it home if I could; for
I had often been musing, whether it might not
be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed
of time goats, which might supply me when my
powder and shot should be all spent. So I made a
collar for this little creature, and with a string which
I had made of some rope yarn, which I always
carried about me, I led him along, tho* with some
difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I
enclos'd him, and left him; for I was very impa-
tient to be at home, from whence I had been ab-
sent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to
me, to come into my old hutch, and lie down in
my hammock-bed: This little wandering journey,
without a settled place of abode, had been so un-
pleasant to me, that my own house, as I call'd it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compar'd
to that; and it renderd every thing about me so
Comfortable, that I resolv'd I would never go a
great way from it again, while it should be my lot
to stay on the island.
I repos'd myself here a week to rest and regale
myself after my long journey; during which, most
N of
ADVENTURES OF
of the time was taken up in the weighty affaif of
making a cage for my poll, who began now to
be a mere domestic, and to be mighty well ac-
quainted with me. I began also to think of the
poor kid, which I had penned in within my little
circle, and resolv'd to go and fetch it home, or
give it some food; accordingly I went, and found
it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out,
but was almost starv'd for want of food: I went
and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such
shrubs as I could find, and threw over to it, and
having fed it, I ty'd it as I did before, to lead it
away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I
had no need to have ty'd it; for it followd me like
a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature
became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it
was from that time one of my domesticks also,
and would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, and I kept the 30th of Sept. in the
fame solemn manner as before, being the an-
niversary of my landing on the ifland, having
now been there two years, and no more prospect
of being deliver'd than the first day I came there.
I spent the whole day in humble and thankful
acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies
which my solitary condition was, attended with,
and without which it might have been infinitely
more
more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks,
that God had been pleasM to discover to me, even
that it was possible I might be more happy in this
solitary condition, than I should have been in a
liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the
World. That he could fully make up to me, the
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of
human society by his presence, and the communi-
cations of his grace to my foul, supporting, com-
sorting, and encouraging, me to depend upon his
providence here, and hope for his eternal presence
hereafter;
It w£s nbw that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy this life I now led was, with all
its miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,
abominable life 1 led all the past part of my days;
and now I chang'd both my sorrows and my joys
my very desires alter'd, my affections chang'd
their guests, and my delights were perfectly new,
from what they were at my first coming, or indeed
for the two years past.
BfiFOkE, as I walk'd about, either on my hunt-
ing, or for viewing the country, the anguisti of
my soul at my condition Would break out upon
me on a sudden, and my very heart would die
within me, to think of the woods, the mountains,
the deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner
N 2 locked
locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness without re-
demption: In the midst of the greatest composures
of my mind, this would break out upon me like
a storm, and make me wring my hands and
weep like a child: Sorpetimes it would take me
in the middle of my work, and I would im-
imediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together > and this was
still worse to me; for if I could burst out into
tears, or vent myself by words, it would go off;
and the grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.
Bus now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts 5 I daily read the word of God, and ap~
plied all the comforts of it to my present state:
One morning being very sad, I open'd the bible
upon these word$^ "I will never leave thee,, nor
forsake thee y immediately it occurr'd, that,
these words were to me, - why else should they
be directed in such a manner, just at.the. 019-
ment when I was mourning over my condition,
as one forsaken of God and man? Well then,
said I, if God does not forsake.me,, of what ill
consequence, can it be, or what matters it, though
the world should all forsake me, seeing ,on the
other;hand, if I had all the world,, and shpuld v
lose the favour and blessing of God,;there would,
be,no; comparison in the loss ?,
From
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more
happy in this forsaken solitary condition, than it
was probable I should ever have been in any other
particular state in the world ; and with this
thought I was going to give thanks to God for
bringing me to this place,
I know not what it was, but something stiock'd
my, mind at that thought, and I durst not Ipeak
the words: How can'st thou be such a hypocrite,
(said I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for
a condition, which however thou may'st endea-
your to be contented with, thou would'st rather pray
heartily to be deliver'd from? so I stopped there:
but though I could not lay, I thank'd God for be-
ing there; yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for
opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providen-
ces, to fee the former condition of my life, and to
mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never
open'd the bible, or shut it, but my very foul
within me blessed God for directing my friend
in England, without any order of mine, to
pack it up among my goods; and for assisting
me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the
ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I be-
gan my third year j and tho' I have not given
N 3 the
ADVENTURES OF
the reader the trouble of so particular an account
of my works this year as the first yet in general
it might be observed, that I was very seldom idle j
but having regularly divided my time, according
to the several daily employments that were be-
fore me, such as, First, N\y duty to God, and the
reading the scriptures, which I constantly set
apart some time for thrice every day. Secondly,
The going abroad with my gun for food, which
generally took me up three hours in every
morning, when it did not rain. Thirdly, The
ordering, curings preserving, and cooking what I
had kilFd or catch'd for my supply j these took
up great part of the day: also it is to be con-
sider'd that in the middle of the qtay when tke
fun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat
was too great to stir out: so that about four hours
in the evening was all the time J could be sup-
posed to work in: with this exception, that
sometimes I chang'd my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, an4
abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allow'd for labour, I de-
sire may be added the exceeding laborioufness
of my work; the many hours, which for want
of tools, want of help, and want of skill, every
thing I did, took up out of my time: for ex-
ample, I was full two and forty days making
me
me a board for a long slielf, which I wanted in
my cave: whereas two lawyers with their tools and
a fawpit, would have cut six of them out of the
same tree in half a day,
My case was this it was to be a large tree,
which was to be cut down, because my board was
to be a broad one. This tree I was three days a
cutting down, and two more cutting off the
boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of
timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing
I reduced both the sides of it into chips, till it be-
gan to be light enough to move; then I turned it,
and made one side of it smooth, and fiat, as a board
from end to end; then turning that side down-
ward, I cut the other side, till I brought the plank
to be. about three inches thick and smooth on
both sides. Any one may judge the labour of
pay hands in such a piece of work; but labour
and patience carried me through that and many
other things: I only observe this in particular,
to shew the reason why so much of my time went
away with so little work, viz. That what might
be a little to be done with help and tools, was
a vast labour, and required a prodigious time to
do alone, and by handi
But notwithstanding this, with patience and
Jabour I went through many things, and indeed
N 4 < - every
every thing that my circumstance made neces-
sary for me to do, as will appear.by what fol-
lows.
I was now in the mdnths of November and
December, expecting my crop of barley and
rice. The ground I had manured or dug up
for them was not great; for as I observed, my
seed of each was not above the quantity of half
a peck $ for I had lost one whole crop by sowing
in the dry season; but now my crop promised
very well, when on a sudden I found I was in
danger of losing it all again by enemies of seve-
ral forts, which it was scarce possible to keep from
it; a§, First, the goats, and wild creatures which
I called hares, who tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came
up, and ate it so close, with it could get no time
to shoot up into stfilk,
This I saw no remedy for, but by making an
enclosure about it with a hedge, which I did with
a great deal of toil; and the more because it
required Jlpeed, However, as my arable land was
but small, suited to my crop, I got it tolerably
well fenced in about three weeks time; and shoot-
ing some of the creatures in the day-time, I set
my dog to guard it in the night,' tying him
up to a stake #t the gate, where he would
Vol. J, stand
(land and bark all night long; so in a little time
the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew
very strong, and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before while my
corn was in the blade •> so the birds were as like-
ly to ruin me now when it was in the ear; for
going along by the place to fee now it throve,
I law my little crop surrounded with fowls of I
know not how many forts, who stood as it^were
watching till I should be gone: I immediately
let fly among them (for I always had my gun
with me) I had no sooner shot but there rose up
a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at
all, from among the corh itself.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that
in a few days they would devour all my hopes,
that I should be starv'd, and never be able to raise
my crop at all, and what to do I could not tell:
However I resolv'd not to lose my corn, if pos-
sible, tho' I should watch it night and day. In
the first place, I went among it to see what da-
mage was already done, and found they had spoil'd
a good deal os it, but that as it was yet too green
for them, the loss was not so great, but that the re-
mainder was like to be a good crop^ if it could

ADVENTURES OF
I staid by it (o load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon
all the trees about me, as if they only waited till I
was gone away, and the event proved it to be so;
for as I walked off as if I was gone, I was no soon-
er out of their sight, but they dropt down one by
one into the corn again. I \yas so provoked that I
could not have patience so stay till more came on,
knowing that every grain that they eat now, was, as
it might be said, a peck loaf to me in the conse-
quence; but coming up to the hedge, I fir'd again,
and kiird three of them. This was what I wisli'd
for; so I took them up, and served them as we
serve notorious thieves in England, (viz.) hang'd
them in chains, for a terror to others. 'Tis impossi-
ble to imagine almost, that this should have any
such effect, as it had: for the fowls would not
only not come at the corn, but in short they
forsook all that part of the island, and I could
never see a bird near the place as long as my scare
crows hung there. This I was very glad of, yo^i
may be sure, and about the latter end of Decem-
ber, which was our second harvest of the year, I
Teap'd my crop.
I Was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle
to out it down, and #11 I could do was to make
one as well as I could out of one of the broad
swords or cutlasses, which I laved among the. arms
4 out
I87
/Gift of the ship. Howeyer, jas my first crop was
but small, I had no great difficulty to ci)t it down;
in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing
off but the ears, and carried it away in a great
basket which I had made, and lb rubbed it out
with my hands; and' at the end of all my har-
vesting, I found that out of my half peck of feed,,
I had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and an half of barley, that is to fay, by
my guess, for I had no measure at that time.
However, this was great encouragement to me
and I foresaw that in time it would please God
to supply me with bread; and yet here I was
perplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind
or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean
it or'part it: nor if made into meal, how to
make bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it; these things being ad-
ded to my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved
not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it
all for seed against the next season, and in the
mean time to employ all my study and hours of
working to accomplish this great work of providing
myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked
for my bread; *tis a little wonderful; and wh&t
I believe few people have thought much upon
(viz)
ADVENTURES OF
(viz.) the strange multitude of little things ne-
cessary in the providing, producing, curing,
dressing, making and finishing this one article
of bread.
I that was reduced to a mere state of nature,
found this to my daily discouragement, and was
made more and more sensible of it every hour,
even after I had got the first handful of seed
corn, which as I have said, came up unexpect-
edly, and indeed to a surprize.
First, I had no plough to turn up the earth,
no spade or stiovel to dig it: well, this I con-
quered, by making a wooden spade, as I ob-
served before -9 but this did my work in but a
wooden manner, and though it cost me a great
many days to make it, yet for want of iron it not
only wore out the sooner, but made my work the
harder, and made it be performed much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the
badness of the performance. When the corn was
lowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go
over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough
of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be
called, rather than rake or harrow it. When it
was growing and grown, I have observed already
how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure
it,
it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home,
thresli, part it from the chaff, and save it: Then
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it,
yeast: and salt to make it into bread, and an
oven to bake it; and yet all these things I did
without, as should be observed; and yet the corn
was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me
too: all this, as I said, made every thing la-
borious and tedious to me, but that there was
no help for; neither was my time so much loss
to me, because as I had divided it, a certain
part of it was every day appointed to these works;
and as I resolved to use none of the corn for
bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I
had the next six1 months to apply myself wholly
by labour and invention to furnish myself with
utensils proper for the performing all the opera-
tions necessary for the making the corn (when
I had it) fit for my use.
Rut first, I was to prepare more land, for I
had now seed enough to sow above an acre of
ground. Before I did this, I had a week's
work at least to make me a spade, which when
it was done, was " but a sorry one indeed, and
very heavy, and required double labour to work
with it; however I went through that, and sow-
ed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground,
as near my hoilse. as I could find them to my
mind,
mind, and fenced them in with a good hedgey
the stakes of which were all cut off that wood
which I had set before, and I knew it would
grow, so that in one year's time I knew I should
have a quick or living hedge, that would want
but lit-tfe repair. This work was not so little as
to take me up less than three months, because
a great part of that time was of the wet season,-
when I could not go abroad. Within doors,
that is, when it rained, and I could not go out,
11 found employment on the following occasions,
always observing, that all the while 1 was at
work I diverted myself with talking to my par-
rot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly
learned him to know his own name, and at last
to speak it out pretty loud, Poll, which was
the first word I ever heard spoken in the island
by any mouth but my own. This therefore
was not my work, but an assistant to my work;
for now, as I said, I had a great employment
upon my hands, as follows, viz. I had long
studied, by some means or other, to make my-
self some earthen vessels, which indeed I want-
ed sorely, but knew not where to come at them:
However, considering the heat of the climate, I
did not doubt but if I could find out any such clay,
I might botch up some such pot, as might, being
dryed in th,e fun, be hard enough and strong enough
to bear handling, and to hold any thing that
was
was dry, and required to be kept so; and as
this was necessary in the preparing corn, meal,
&c. which was the thing I was upon, I resol-
ved to make some as large as I could, and fit
only to stahd like jars, to hold what should be
put intp them.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many aukward ways
I took to raise this pastil, what odd mifhapen
ugly things I made, how many of them fell in,
and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff
enough to bear its own weight; how many
cracked by the over violent heat of the fun,
being set out too hastily; and how many fell
in pieces with only removing, as well before
as after they were dry'd: and in a word, how
after having laboured hard to find the clay, to
dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and
work it: I could not make above two large
earthen ugly things, I cannot call them jars,
in about two months labour.
However, as the fun baked these two, very-
dry and hard, I lifted them very gently up and
set. them down again in two great wicker baskets,
which I had made on purpose for them, that
they might not break, and as between the pot
and the basket there was a little room to spare,
I stuffed
\
J 92
ADVENTURES OP
I stuffed it full of the rice and barley-straw,
and these two pots being to stand always dry,
I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps
the meal, when the corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much ih my design
for large pots, yet I made lerveral smaller things
with better success, such as little round pojs,
fiat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing
my hand turned to, and the heat of the fun
baked them strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which
was to get an earthen pot to hold what was
liquid, and bear the fire which none of these
could do. It happened after some time, mak-
ing a pretty large fire for cooking my meat,
when I went to put it out after I had done
with it, I found a broken piece of one of my
earthen ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard
as a stone, and red a£ a tile. I was agreeably
surprized to see it, and said to myself, that cer-
tainly they might be made to burn whole if they
would burn broken.
This set me to studying how to order my
fire, so as to make it burn me some pots* I
had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters
burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though
4 I had
I had some lead to do it with $ but I placed three
large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile one
upon another, and placed my fire-wood all round
it with a great heap of embers under them; I ply-
ed the fire with fresh fuel round the out-side,andupon
the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red hot quite
through, and observed that they did not crack at all;
when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat
about 5 or 6 hours, till I found one of them, though
it did not crack, did melt or run, for die sand
which was mixed with the clay melted by the vio-
lence of the hea^ and would have run into glass, if
I had gone on> so I flacked my fire gradually till
the pots began to abate of the red colour, and watch-
ing them all night, that I might not let the fire
abate too fast; in the morning I had three very
good, I will not fay handsome, pipkins, and two,
other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be de-
sired; and one of them perfectly glazed with the
tuning of the sand*
After this experiment, (I need not fay) I want-
ed no fort of earthen ware for my use; but I must
needs lay> as to the shapes of them* they were very
indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no
way of making them, but as the childrea make
dirt pies, or as a woman would make pies, that
never learnd to raise paste.
Vol L O N<a
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal'to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly
patience to stay till they were cold, before I fat one
on the fire again, with some water in it, to boil
me some meat, which it did admirably well; and
with a piece of kid, I made some very good broth,
tho* I wanted oatmeal and several other ingredients;
requisite to make it so good as I would have had it
been.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands. To supply this want I
was at a great loss; for of all the trades in the world
I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone cutter, as
for any whatever; neither had I any tools to go
about it with. I spent many a day to find out a
great stone big enough to cut hollow, and make
fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except
what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way
to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the
island of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy
crumbling stone, which neither would bear the
weight of a heavy pestle, or would break the corn
without filling it with sand; so after a great deal of
time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over,
andresolv'd to look out for a great block of hard
wood,
Wood; which I found indeed much easier; and get-
ting one as big as 1 had strength to stir, I rounded
it, and form'd it on the out-side with my axe and
hachet, and then with the help of fire, and infinite
labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in
Brasil make their canoes; After this I made a great
heavy pestle, or bearer of the wood, called the iron
wood, and this I prepared and laid by against I had
my riext crop of corn, when I proposed to myself,
tb grind or rather pound my corn into meal> to
make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve> or search,
to dress my meal, and to part it from the bran and
the hufc, without which I did not fee it possible I
could have any bread; This was a most difficult
thing, so much as but to think on; for to be sure I
had nothing like the necessary thing to make it> I
mean fine thin canvas, or stuff, to search the meal
through. And hfere I was at a full stop for many
months; nor did I really know what to dolinen I
had none left, but what was mere rags; I had goats
hair, but neither knew I how to weave it or spin it;
and had I known how, here were no tools to work
it with; all the remedy I found for this, was, at last
I did remember I had among the seamen's clothes,
which were saved out of the stiip, some neck cloths
of caJlicOj or muslin, and with some pieces of these
I made three small sieves, but proper enough for the

work; and thus I made shift for some years, how £
did afterwards I shall shew in its place.'
The: baking part was the next thing to. be consi-
dered, and how I should make bread when \ came.
to have corn; for first I had no- yeast; as to. that
part,, as. there was. tio supplying the want, so I did
not concern myself much about it: but for an oven*
i was indeed in great painat length I found out
an expedient, for that also, which was this; I
made some earthero vessels, very broad but not
deep, that is to fay,* about two feet diameter, and-
not above nine inches deep; these I burned in. the
sire, as I had done the other,, and; laid them by;-
and when I wanted t&bakeTI made a great fire upoi*
my hearth, which I had paved with some square tile&
of my 'own baking, and burning also; boat I should
not call them square*
When the fire wood was burned pretty much into
Ambers, ; or live coals, I drew them forward
upon the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and
there I let them lie,, till the hearth was very hot,
then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my
loaf,- or loaves, and whelming down the earthen pot
tipon them, drew the embers all round the outside
of the pot, to keep in and add tb the heat; and thus
as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my
barley loaves, and became in little time a mere
pastry
pastry cook into the bargain for I made myself se-
veral cakes of the luce and puddings.; indeed I
made no pies,, neither had I any thing-to put into
them, supposing I had, except the flesh either of
fowls :or gb&ts.

ADVENTURES OF
not but that the difficulty .of launching my boat came
often into my head but I put a stop to my own
enquiries into it, by this foolish answer which I gave
myself, Let us first make it, I will warrant I will
find some way or other to get it along; when it is
4one*
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I
yent* I felled a cedar tree fit for the building of the
Temple at Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty two
feet, after which it lessened for a while, and then
parted into branches: it was not without infinite
labour that I felled this tree: I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at it, at the bottom. I was
fourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and
the vast spreading head of it cut off, which I hack-
ed and hewed through with axe and hachet^ and
inexpressible labour: after this., it cost me a month
to shape it, and dub.it to proportion, and to some-
thing like the bottom of a boat, that it might Iwim
upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three
months more to clear the in-side, and work it out
so as to make an exact boat of it; this I did indeed
without fire, by mere mallet and chissel, and by the
dint oshard lafbpur, till I had brought it to be a very
handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried
six
six and twenty men* and consequently big enough
to have carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The boat was really
much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua
that was made. of one tree in my life. Many a
weary stjroke it had cost, you may be sure; and
there remained nothing but to get it into the wa-
ter 5 and had J gotten it into the water, I make no
xjuestioij but I Jfhould have begun the maddest voy-
age and, the most unlikely to be performed, that ever
was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed
-me; tho' they cost me infinite labour too. It lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more. But the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards tjhie creek; well, to take away this dis-
- couragernent I resolved to dig into the surface or
the earth, and so make a declivity: This I begun,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains; but who
grudge pains, that have their deliverance in view?
But when this was worked through, and this difficulty
managed, it was still much at one; for I couid no
more stir the canoe, than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and
resolved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring uie
water
quantity every year, that I sowed the last, in hopes
that such a quantity would fully provide me with
bread, &x.
All the while these things were doing, you may
be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prof-
. pect of land which I had seen from the other fide of
• the island; and I was nqt without lecret wishes that
I were on shore there, fancying, that seeing the
main land, and in an inhabited, country, I might
find some way or other to convey myself farther,
and perhaps ^t last find feme means pf escape.
BUT all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I
might have reason to think far worse than the lions
and tigers, of Africa, that if once I came in their
power, I fhonjld run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed> and perhaps of being eaten,
for I had heard that the people of the Caribean
, coast were canibals, or man eaters! And I knew
by the latitude, that I could not be far off from the
ihore. That supposing they were not canibals, yet
that they might kill me, as many Europeans, who
had fallen into their hands, had been served, even
when they have been ten or twenty together -y much
more I that was but one, and could make little or
110 defence i all these things, I fay, which I pught
to
m have considered well of, and did cast up in my
thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my ap^
prehensions at first; but my head ran mightily
upon the .thought of getting over to the shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and .the long
boat with the shoulder of mutton fail, with which I
sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of Afric-;
but this was in vain, then I thought I would go
and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said^
was blown up upon the shore, a great way in the
storm, when we were first cast away. She lay
almost where she did at firsts but not quite; and
was turned by the force of the waves and the winds,
almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of
beachey rough sand; but ,no water about her as be-
fore;.
If I had had hands to have resitted her, and to
Jiave launched her into the water, the boat would
.have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the .Brasils with her easily enough; but I
might have foreseen that I could no more turn her
and set her upright upon her bottom, than I could
remove the island: however I Nyent to the woods,
and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the
boat, resolved to try what I could do, suggesting
to myself, that if I could but turn her down, I might
easily repair the damage she had received,, and she
O 4 ^vould
would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea,
in her very easily.
I spared no pains indeed) in this piece of fruit-
less toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks
about it y at last finding it impossible to heave it up
with my little strength, I fell to digging away the
sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down,
setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in
the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
lip again, or to get under it, much less to move it
forward, towards the water $ so I was forced to
give it over; and yet though I gave over the hopes
of the boat, - my desire to venture over the main
increased, rather than decreased, ^s the means for
it seemed impossible.
This at length put me upon thinking, whether
it was not possible to make myself a canoe, or peri-
agua such as the natives of those climates make,
even without tools, or as I might fay, without
hands, viz. of a trunk of a great tree. This I not
only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself
extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with
my having much more convenience for it than any
pf the negroes or Indians; but not at all consider-
ing the particular inconveniences which I lay under,
more
more than the Indians did, viz. want of hands to
move it when it was made, into the water, a diffi-
culty much harder for me to surmount than all the
consequences of want of tools could be to them; £ot
what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast
tree, in the woods, I might with much trouble cut
it down, if after I might be able with my tools to
hew and dub the out-fide into the proper shape of a
boat, and burn or cut out the in-side to make it
hollow, so as to make a boat of it; if after all -this,
I must leave it just there where I found it, and was
not able to launch it into the water.
One would have thought, if I could have had
the least reflection upon my mind, of my circum^
stances while I. was making this boat, I should
hav£ immediately thought how I should get it into
the sea: but my thoughts were so intent upon my
voyage over the sea in it, that 1 never once coiisi -
dered how I should get it off the land and it was
really in its own nature more easy for me to guide
it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty-five
fathoms of land, where it lay, to let it afloat in thfc
water,
I went to work upon this boat, the most like a
fool that ever man did, who had any of him fenses
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was able to undertake it;
not
<&G4 'A b V fe 'tf T V R E S ft F .
'water > up 16 the cano6, feing I eotild hot bring
the canoe down to this water: Well, I began this
work, and when I began to enter into it, and
calculate how deep it was to be 'dug, hotfr broads
how the stuff to be thrown out, I founds 'that by
the number of hands I had, being nonie but my
jowri, it must have been fen or twelve yeafrs before
I. Sid>uld have gohe through with it 5 for the flipse
lay high, so that at the upper end^it feust have been
'at"least twenty feet deep; so at length, though
with great reluctancy, I gay£ tMs: &:tteiipt over
.also. - :'
This grieved me heartily, and now I saw?
thoughtoo late, the folly of beginAihg' a work be-
fore we count the cost; and before Ve judg£ rightly
of our own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work, I fihistied frty
fourth year in this plate, and kept my anniversary
with the same devotion, and with as much comfort
as ever before; for by constant study, and serious
•application of the word of God, and by the affis-
taiice of his grace, I gained a different knowledge
from what I had before. I entertained different
notions of things. I looked now upon the world
as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do
with, ho expectation from, and indeed no desires
about: In a word, I had nothing indeed to do
with
K. 0: BI N, S 6 N( C R It S Q E.
with it, npr was ever like to have; so I thought it
looked as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out
of it, and well might I fay. as. father Abraham to.
Dives," Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed."
In the first place,. I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here >cc I had neither the lust
<c of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life:"
I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now
capable 9s enjoying; I was lord of the whole
manor, or if I pleased I Height call myself king,
or emperor over the whole country which I had
ppsefliQU of; th^re were no rivals, I had no com-
petitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command
with me: I might have raised ship loadings of
corn, but I had no use for itj ib I let as little grow
as I thought enough for my occasion: I had tortoise.
6r turtle enough, but now and then one was as
much as. I could put to any use: I had timber
enough to have built a fleet of ships: I h^cl 
grapes enough to have made wine or to hav$ cured
hito raisins, to have loaded.tlvat. fleet when tlv*y
had been built.
Rut all I could make use of was all that, was
valuable; I had enough to eat and to luply my
wants; and what was all the rest to me? If I filled,
more stelh than I could cat, the dog must eat it cr
4 the
ABVENtURES Q /
the vermin: If I sowed more corn than I could eat, it
must be Ipoiled: The trees that I cut down were
lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more
use of them than for fuel* and that I had no
occasion for, but to dress my food*
Itt a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me, upon just reflection, That all the
good things of this world are no farther good to us
than they are for our use; and that whatever
we may heap up indeed to give others, we en-
joy just as much as we can use, and no more.
The most covetous griping miser in the world
Would have been cured of the vice of covetousness,
if he had been in my cafe j for I possessed infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no
rbom for. desire, except it was of things which I
had not, and they were but trifles, though indeed
df great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a,
parcel of money, as well gold a£ silver about
thirty-six pounds, sterling; alas! there the nasty
sorry useless stuff lay, I had no manner of
business for it; and I often thought with myselfy
that I would have given a handful of it for a gross
of tobadcco pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my
corn 5 nay, I would have given it all for six pen-
ny-worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England,,
or for a handful of peas, and beans, and a bottle of
ink: As it was, I had .hot the least advantage by"
it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of the* cave in
the wet seasons: and if I had had the drawer full
of diamonds, it had been the fame cafe, and they
had been of no manner of value to me, because
of no use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my mind as well as to my body. I frequent-
ly set down to my meat with thankfulness,,
and admired the hand of God's providence,
which had thus spread my table in the wilderness:
1 learned to look more upon die bright side of my
condition, and less upon the dark side, and to
consider, what I enjoyed rather than what I
wanted 5 and this gave me sometimes such secret
comforts that I cannot express them, and which I
take notice of here to put those discontented peo~
pie in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably
what God has given them, because they see and covet
something that he has not given them: All our
discontents about what we want, appeared to me
to spring from the want of thankfulness for what
we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me,. and1
doubtless would be so to any one that should salt
into such distress as mine was; and this was, to

Adventures of
compare my present condition with what I at firil
expected it should be; nay with what it would
certainly have been, if the good providence of
God had not Wonderfully ordered the ship to be
cast up nearer to the ihore, where I not only
could come at her, but could bring what I got out of
her to the shore, for my relief and comforts without
which I had wanted for tools to work, weapons for
defence, gun-powder and Ihot, for getting my food*
1 spent whole hours, I may fay whole days, iii
reprefenting to myself in the most lively colourst
how I must have acted if I had got nothing out of the
ship. I could not have so much as got any food*
except fish and turtles; and that as it was long
before I found any of them, I must have perished
first. That I should have lived, if I had not perished,
like a mere savage. That if I had killed a goat, or
a fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way to flay
or open them, or part the flesh from the skin, and
the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with
my teeth, and pull it with my claws like a beast.
These reflections made me very sensible of the
goodnesa of Providence to rne, and very thankful
for my present condition, with all its hardships
and misfortunes: 'And this part also I cannot but
recommend to the reflection of those, who are
apt in their misery to say, <c Is any affliction like
ftiine!" Let them consider, how much worse the
cases
pases some other people are, and their case might
have been, if providence had thought fit*
I had another reflection which assisted me also
to comfot my mind with hopes; and this was,
comparing my present condition with what I had
deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from
the hand of providence. I had lived a dreadful
life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear
of God. I had been well instructed by father and
mother; neither had they been wanting to me, in
their early endeavours, to infuse a religious awe of
God into my mind, a fense of my duty, and of
what the nature and end of my being required of
me. But alas! falling early into the seafaring life,
which of all lives is tine most destitute of the fear
of God, though his terrors are always before
them; I fay, falling early into the seafaring life,
and into seafaring company, all that little sense of
religion which I had entertained, was laughed out
of me by my mess-mates, by a hardened despising
of dangers, and the views of death, which grew
habitual to me; by my long absence from all
manner of opportunities to converse with any
thing but what was like myself, or to hear any
thing that was good, or tender towards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or of
the least fense of what I was, o$ was to be, in that

the greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape
from Salee; my being taken up by the Portuguese
master os a ship; my being planted so well in the
^Brazils"; my receiving the cargo from England,
,and the like; I never had once the word, thank
-God, so much as on my mind, or in my mouth;
nor in the greatest' distress* had I so much as a
thought to pray to him, Or so much> as to fay.
"Lord have mercy upon me;" no nor to mention
the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and
blaspheme it.
1 hap terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account
.of my wicked and hardened life past: and when I
looked about me, and considered what particular
providences had attended me since my coming-into
this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with
me ;, had not only ptmislied me less than my irii*
quity had deserved, but had so plentifully provided
fpr me; this gave me great hopes that my repent-
ance v as accepted, and that God had yet mercy hi
'store for me,
With these reflections I worked my mind up,
not only to a resignation to the will of God in the
present disposition of my circumstances, but even
"to a sincere thankfulness for my condition, and
that I who was yet a living man, ought not to com-
plain,
211
plain,'feeing I had not the due puifhmcnt of my
sins ; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no
reason to have expected in that place; that I ought
never more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice,
and to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which
nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought: that I ought to consider I had been fed
even by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding
Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long series of mira-
cles, and that I could hardly have named a place in
the uninhabitable part of the world, where I could
have been cast more to my advantage: a place
where, as I had no society, which was my affliction
on one hand, so I found no ravenous beast, no
furious wolves or tygers to threaten my life, no
venomous creatures, or poisonous, which I might
feed on to my hurt; no savages to murder and de-
vour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way,
so it was a life of mercy another, and I wanted no-
thing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to
make my Tense of God's goodness to me, and care
over me in this condition, be my daily.consolation;
and aster I did make a just improvement of these
things, I went away and was no more fad.
I had now been here so long, that many things
which I brought on stiore for my help, were
P 2 either
ADVENTURES OF
either quite gone, or very much wasted and near
spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eeked out with
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce
lest any appearance of black upon the paper: as
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down
the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me, and first by casting up times
past, I remember that there was a strange concur-
ance of days in the various providences which befel
me, and which if I had been superstitioufly inclined
to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have
had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of
curiosity.
First I had observed, that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and
ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same
day, afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of
war, and made a slave* The fame day of the year
that I escaped out of the wreck of that ship in Yar-
mouth roads, that fame day-year afterwards I made
my escape from Salee in the boat * and the fame
day of the year I was born on, viz. the 30th of
September, that fame day I had my life so miracu-
lously saved twenty-six years after, when I was cast
on
on stiore in this island so that my wicked life and
my solitary life began both on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was
that of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I
brought out of the ship; this I had husbanded to
the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of
bread a day for above a year, and yet I was quite
without bread for near a year before I got any corn
of my own; and great reason I had to be thankful
that I had any at all, the getting it being as has
been already observed, next to miraculous.
My cloaths too began to decay mightily: as to li-
nen, I had had none for a great while, except some
chequered shirts which I found in the chests of other
seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because,
many times I could bear no other cloaths on but a
shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I had,
among all the mens cloaths of the ship, almost three
dozen of shirts. There were also several thick
watch coats of the seamens, which were left indeed,
but they were too hot to wear; and though it is true
that the weather was so violent hot, that there was
no need of cloaths, yet I could not go quite naked;
no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was
not, nor could I abide the thought of it, though
I was all alone.
P 3 The
\
The reason why I could not go quite naked was,
I could not bear the heat of the fun so well when
quite naked as with some cloaths on; nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin, whereas with a
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist-
ling under that shirt was toofold cooler than with-
out it. No more could I ever bring myself to go
out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat;
the heat of the sun beating with such violence as it
does in that place, would give me the head ach pre-
sently,- by darting so directly upon my head, with-
out a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear.it,
whereas if I put on my hat it would presently go
away. *
Upon these views I began to consider about
putting the few rags I had, which 1 called cloaths,
into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoats
I had, and my business was now to try if I could not
make jackets out of the great watch-coats, which
•I had by me, and with "such other materials as I
had; so I set to work a tayloring, or rather indeed
a botching, for I made most pitious work of it.
However I made shift to make two or three new
waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while; as for breeches or drawers, I made but a
very sorry sliift indeed, till afterwards.
I HAVE
215
I have mentioned that I saved the flcins of all
the creatures that I killed, I mean four footed ones, •
and I had hung them up, stretched out with sticks,
in the fun, by which means some of them were so
dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others.
I found very useful. The first thing I madeof these,
was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the
outside to shoot off the rain; and this I performed
so well, that after this I made me a suit of cloaths
wholly of the skins, that is to fay, a waist-coat and
breeches open at the knees, and both loose, for
they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to
keep me warm, I must not omit to acknowledge
that they were wretchedly made j for if I was a bad
carpenter, I was a worse taylor. However, they
were such as I made very good shift with; and
when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair
of my waist-coat and cap being outermost, I was
l^ept very dry,
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains
to make me an umbrella; I was indeed in great
want of one, and had a great mind to make one; I
had seen them made in the Brasils, where they were
very useful in the great heats which are there. And
I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater
too, being nearer the equinox -y besides as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I
P 4 took
\
took a world of pains at it, and was a great while
before I could make any thing likely to hold; nay,
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or
three before I made one to my mind; but at last I
made one that aniwered indifferently well; the main
difficulty I found was to make it to let down. I
could make it to spread, but if it did not let down
too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any
way but just over my head, which would not do.
However, at last as I said, I made one to answer,
and covered it with skins, and their hair upwards,
so that it cast off the rains like a pent-house, and
kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk
out in the hottest of the weather with greater ad-
vantage than I could before in the coolest, and
when I had no need of it could close it, and carry
it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind
being entirely composed by resigning to the will
of God and throwing myself wholly upon the
disposal of his providence. This made my life
better than sociable, for when I began to regret
the want of conversation, I would ask myself
whether thus conversing mutually with my own
thoughts, and, as I hope I may fay, with even
God himself by ejaculations, was not better than
the utmost enjoyment of human society in the
world?
I CANNOT
I cannot fay that (after this, for five years,
any extraordinary thing happened to me, but I
lived on in the fame course, in the same pos-
ture and place, just as before; the chief things
I was employed in, besides my yearly labour
of planting my barley and rice, and curing my
raisins, of both which I always kept up just
enough to have sufficient stock of one year's
provision before hand; I fay, besides this yearly
labour, and my daily labour of going out with
my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe,
which at last I finished. So that by digging a
canal to it of six feet wide, and four feet deep,
I brought it into the creek, almost half a mile.
As for the first, which was so vastly big, as I
made it without considering beforehand, as I
ought to do, how I should be able to launch
it; so never being able to bring it into the
water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged
to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to
teach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the
next time, though I could not get a tree pro-
per for it, and in a place where I could not get
the water to it, at any less distance than, as I
have said, near half a mile; yet as I law it was
practicable at last, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two years about it, yet I
never grudged my labour in hopes of having
a boat to go off to sea at last,
2 How-
\
However, though my little periagua was
finished, yet the size of it was not at all an-
swerable to the design which I had in. view, when
I made the first; I mean, of venturing over to
the Terra firma, where it was above forty miles
broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat
assisted to put an end to that design, and now I
thought no more of it, but as I had a boat,
my next design was to make a tour round the
isiand; for as I had been on the other side, in
one place crossing, as I have already described
it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in
that little journey made me very eager to fee
other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat,
I thought of nothing but failing round the is-
land.
For this purpose, that I might do every thing
with discretion, and consideration, I fitted up a
Jittle mast to my boat, and made a sail to it
out of some of the pieces of the ship's fails
which lay in store, and of which I had a great
stock by me.
Having fitted my mast and fail, and tried the
boat, I found she would sail very well: then I
made little lockers, or boxes, at either end of my
boat, to put provisions, necessaries and ammuni-
tion &c. intOj to be kept dry, either from rain
or
i
2Ip
or the sprye of the' sea; and a little long hollow
place I cut in the inside os the boat, where I
could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down
over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern,
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep
the heat os the sun off me, like an awning;
.and thus I every now and then took a little
voyage upon the sea, but never went far out,
nor far from the little creek; but at last being
eager to view the circumference of my little
kingdom, I resolved upon my tour; and ac-
cordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage,
putting in two dozens of my loaves (cakes I
.should rather call them) of barley bread, an
earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a
.great deal of, a little bottle of run, half a goat,
and powder and shot for killing more, and two
large watch coats, of those which, as I men-
tioned before, I had saved out of the seamens
chests, these I took to lie upon, and cover me
in the night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year
of my reign, or my captivity, which you please,
that I set out on this voyage, and I found it
much longer than I expected 5 for though the
island itself was not very large, yet when I came
to
v
to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of
rocks lie out above two leagues into the sea,
some above water, some under it; and beyond
that a shoal of land lying dry half a league
more; so that I was obliged to go a great way
out to sea to double the point.
When first I discovered them, I was going to
give over my enterprize, and come back again,
not knowing how far it might oblige me to
go out to sea, and above all, doubting how I
should get back again; so I came to an anchor,
having made me a kind of an anchor with a piece
of a broken grapling I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun and
went on shore cilmbing up on a hill, which seem-
ed to overlook that point, where I saw the full
extent of it, and resolved to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I
stood, I perceived a strong and indeed a most
furious current, which ran to the east, and even
came close to the point; and I took the more
notice of it, because I saw there might be some
danger, that when I came into it, I might be
carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not
be able to make the island again; and indeed
had I not gotten first up on this hill, I believe
'it
it would have been so; for there was the fame
current on the other side the island, only that it
set off at a farther distance -9 and I saw there
was a strong eddy under the shore > so I had
nothing to do but to get in out of the first current,
and I should presently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days, because the
wind blowing pretty fresti at E. S. E. and that
being just contrary to the said current, made a
great breach of the sea upon the point; so that
it was not safe for me to keep too close to the
shore for the breach, nor to go too far off be •
cause of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind hav-
ing abated over night, the sea was calm, and I
ventured; but I am a warning-piece again to
all ralh and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I
come to the point, when even I was not my
boat's length from the shore, but I found myself
in a great depth of water, and a current like the
sluice of a mill; it carryed my boat along with
it with such violence, that all I could do, could
not keep her so much as on the edge of it;
but I found it hurried me farther and farther
out from the eddy which was on my left hand.
There was no wind stirring to help me, and all
I could do with my paddles signified nothing,
and
\
and now \ began to give myself over for' lost %
for as the current was on both fides the island, I
knew in a few leagues distance they must join
again, and then I was irrecoverably gone; nor
did I fee any possibility of avoiding it; ib that
I had no proipect before me but of perishing;
not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of
starving for hunger. I had indeed found a tor-
toise on the shore* as big almost as I could lift,
and'had tossed it into the boat; and I had a
great jar of Fresh water, that is to fay, -one of
my earthen pots; but what ?was all this to being
driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure,
there was no shore, no main land3 or istand, for
a thousand leagues at least.
And now I saw how easy it was for the pro-
vidence of God to make even the most miserable
condition of mankind, worse. Now I looked back
upon my desolate solitary island, as the most pleasant
place in the world, and all the happiness my
heart could wish for, was to be but there again.
I stretched out , my hands to it, with eager wishes.
O happy desert! said I, I shall never see thee more.
O miserable creature! said I, whither am I going?
Then I reproached myself with my unthankful
temper, and how I ,had repined at my solitary
condition, and now what would I give to be
on sliore there again? thus we never fee the true
state

by its contraries ! nor know how- to value what
we'enjoy/but by the want of it; 'Tis scarce
possible to imagine the consternation I was novts
;h, being'driven from my beloved- island (for
so it appeared to me now to Be j 'into the-"wide
ocean, almost two leagues, and in the! utrriost
despair of ever recovering it a^airi. However,
I worked hard, till' indeed my-strength; was al-
most exhausted and kept my boat as much to
the northward, thk'is, towards! the' side of the
current which the eddy' lay' oh, as; possibly \I
could r when about4 noon as the" fun passed . the
meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind
in my face, springing up from the S. S. E.
This tdieered my heart a little, and especially
when in1 about Mis an hour' more, it blew a
pertty gerttle gklt. By this time I was gotten
at. a frightful distance from' the' island, and had
the least cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had
t>£eli undone another way too; foif I had no com-
pass on' bbard, /and should ritv&F  have known
how to have stewed1 towards ''the island, if I
had dost fight of:it;,:b'ut the1 :weadier continuing
clear, I applied myself to get up my mast
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the
north as much as possible, to get out ;of -the
current.
Just
114 ApVEtfTtTRfiS OF
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the
boat began to stretch away, I saw even by the
clearness of the water, some alteration of the cur-<
rent was near; for where the current was so strong
the water was foul; but perceiving the water
clear, I found the current abate, and presently
found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach
of the sea upon some rocks; these rocks I found
caused the current to part again, and as the main
stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the north east; so the other returned
by the repulse of the rocks and made a strong
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west,
with a very [iharp stream-
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be re-
scued from thieves just going to murder them,
tt>r, who have been in such like extremities, may
guess what my present surprise of joy was, and
how gladly I put my boat into the stream of
this eddy and the wind also frestxning, how gladly
I spread my sail to it, running cheerfully before
the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under
foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my
way back again directly towards the island, but
about two leagues more to the northward than
the
the current which carried me away at first; so
that when I came near the island, I found my-
self open to the northern sliore of it, that is to
fay, the other end of the island opposite to that
which I went out from.
When I had rtlade some thirig more than &
league of way by the help of this current ot
eddy, I found it was {pent and served me no
farther. However, I found that being between
the two great currents, (viz) that on the south-
side, which had hurried me away, and that on
the north, which lay about a league on the other
side; I say> between these two, in the wake of
the island; I found the water at least still, and
running no way, and having still a breeze of wind
fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the
island, though not making such fresli way as I
did before;
Afebift foiir a-clock in the evening, being
then within about a league of the island, I found
the point of the rocks which occasioned this
disaster, stretching dut, as is described before,
to the southward, and casting off the current
more southerly, had of course made another eddy
to the north, and this I found very strong, but
not directly setting the way my course lay Which
was due. west; but almost full north; However
having
ADVENTURES OF
having a fresh gale, I stretched a-cross this eddy
slanting north west, and in about an hour came
within about a mile of the shore, where it being
smooth water I soon got to land.
When I was on shore I fell on my knees, and
gave God thanks for my deliverance, resolving
to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by
my boat, and refreshing myself with such things
as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore
fn a little cove that I had spied under some
trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite
spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get
home with my boat, I had run so much hazard,
and knew too much of the case to think of attemp-
ting it by the way I went out, and what might be at
the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor
had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I only
resolved in the morning to make my way west-
ward along the shore, and to see if there was no
creek where I might lay up my frigate in safe-
ty, so as to have her again if I wanted her;
in about three miles or there about, coasting the
shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay about
a mile over, which narrowed till it . came to a
very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very
convenient harbour for my boat, and where she
lay
227
lay as if she had been in a little dock made on
purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stow-
ed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look
about me and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little past by the
place where I had been before, when I travell-
ed on foot to that sliore 5 so taking nothing out
of my boat, but my gun and my umbrella, for
it was exceeding hot, I began my march; the
way was comfortable enough after such a voyage
as I had been upon, and I reached my old bower
in the evening, where I found eveiy thing standing
as I left it; for I always kept it in good order,
being as I said before my country house*
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs; for I was very weary,
and fell a sleep: but judge you, if you can, that
read my story what a surprize I must be in,
when I awaked out of my sleep by a voice cal-
ling me by my name several times Robin, Robin,
Robin Crusoe* poor Robin Crusoe, where are you
Robin Crusoe? Where were you?
. I was so dead a"* sleep at first, being fatigued
with rowing or peddling, as it is called, the first
part of the day, and with walking the latter
part that I did not wake thoroughly, but dozing
Q^z' be-
between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed
that some body spoke to me: but as the voice
continued to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,
at last I began to wake more perfectly, and was
at first dreadfully frighted, and started up in the
utmost consternation: but no sooner were my
eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top
of the hedge: and immediately knew that it was
he that spoke to me; and just in such bemoaning
language as I used to talk to him and teach him;
and he had learned it so perfectly, that he would
sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my'
face, and cry, cc poor Robin Crusoe, where are
you? Where were you? How come you here?"
And such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the
parrot, and that indeed it could be nobody else
it was a good while before I could compose my-
self: first, I was amazed how the creature got
thither, and then, how he should just keep about
the place, and no where else: but as I was well
satisfied it could be no one but honest Poll, I got
it over: and holding out my hand, and calling
him by his name, Poll, the sociable creature came
to me and sat upon my thumb, as he used to
do, and continued talking to me, " Poor Robin
Crusoe, and how came I here? and where had
I been^ just as if he had been overjoyed to fee
me
me again; and so I carried him home along with
me.
I now had enough of rambling to sea for
some time, and had enough to do for many days
to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had
been in: I would have been very glad to have
had my boat again on my side of the island; but
I knew not how it was practicable to get it about.
As to the east side of the island, which I had
gone round, I knew well enough there was no
venturing that way: nay my very heart would
shrink and my very blood run chill but to
ihmk of it ; and as to the other side of the island
I did not know how it might be there: but
supposing the current ran with the same force
against the shore at the east as it passed by it
on the other, I might run the fame risk of being
driven down the stream> and carried by the island
as I had been before, of being carried away from
it; so with these thoughts I contented myself to
be without any boqt, chough it had been the
product of so many months labour to make it,
and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper, I .remained
ne^r a year, lived a very sedate. retired life, as
you may well iijppose; and my thoughts being
very much composed as to my condition, and
CL3' fully,
fully comforted in resigning myself to the disposi-
tions of providence, I thought I lived really very
happy in all things, except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the me-
chanick exercises which my necessities put me upon
applying myself to, and I believe could, upon
occasion, make a very good carpenter; especially
considering how few tools I had.
• Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected per-
fection in my earthen ware, and contrived well
enough to make them with a wheel, which I
found infinitely easier and better •> because I made
things round and sliapeable, which before were
filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I
was never more vain of my own performance,
or more joyful for any thing I found out, than for
my being able to make a tobacco-pipe. And though
it was a very ugly clumsy thing, when it was
done, and only burnt red like other earthen ware,
yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the
imoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for
I had been always used to smoke, and there were
pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not
thinking that there was tobacco in the island; and
afterwards, w{ien I searched the ship again, I
jC.ould not come at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention shewed me, though not very handsome,
yet they were such as were very handy and con-
venient for my laying -things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it and
dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home
in a' basket, and the like by a turtle, I could cut
it up, take out thfe eggs, and a piece or two of
the S'efh,, which was enough for rne, and bring
them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind
me. Also large deep baskets were the receivers
for«my :coi>n, which 1 always rubbed out as soon as it
wa$sdry, arid' cured, and kept it in great baskets.
1 began now to perceive my powder abated
considerably, and this was a want which it was
nupofiible for me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider'-what I must do when I should have no
more powder^ .that is to Jay, how I should do to
liill any goat. ; 'J had", as is observed in the third
year df my being here, kept a young kid, and
breed her up tame, and I was in hopes of
getting a he-goat, but I could not by any means
bring it to pals, 'till' my kid grew an old goat;
and I could never find in my heart to kjU her,
till she died at last of meer age.
Q^4 But
\
But being now in th,e i ifh year of my residence*
and as I have said, my ammunition growing low>
I set myself to stydy some art to trap and snare
the goats, tq see whether I could catch some of
them alive, and particularly I wanted a she goat
great with young.
To this pupose I made snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more thaji once taken
in them, but my tackle was not good, for I had
no wire, and I always fpund them broken, and
my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit fall, so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I
had observed the goats used to feed, and over
those pits I placed hurdles of my own making
too, with a great weight upon them; and several
times I put ears of barley and dry rice, without
setting the trap, and I could easily perceive that
the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for
I could fee the marks of their feet. At length I
set three traps in one night, and going the next
morning I found them all standing, and yet the bait
eaten and gone: this was very discouraging. How
ever, I altered my trap, and not to trouble you with
particulars, going one morning to fee my traps, I
found in one of them a large old he goat,and in one
of the other, three kids, a male and two females.
As
233
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
•him, he was so fierce I durst not venture to handle
him; that is to fay, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
killed him, but that was not my business, nor would
it answer my end. So I e'en made a shift to let
him out, and he ran away as if he had been
frighted out of his wits: But I had forgot
then what I had learned afterwards, that hunger
will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there
three or four days without food, and then have
carryed him some water to drink, and then a
little corn, he would have been as tame as one of
the kids, for they are mighty sagacious tractable
creatures where they are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing
no better at that time; then I went to the tnree kids,
and taking them one by one, I tied them with
strings together, and with some difficulty brought
them all home,
'Twas a gpod while before they would feed, but
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them
and they began to be tame; and now I found that
if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh when
I had no powder or ihot left, breeding some up
tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have
them about my house like a flock of sheep.
But
\.
But then it presently occured to;me, that I must
keep the tame from the wild, ot else they would
always run wild when they grew up, and the only
way for this was to have some enclosed piece of
ground well fenced either with hedge or pale, to
keep them in so effectually, that those within might,
not break out, onthofe without break in.
This was a great undertaking lor one pair of
hands, yet as I saw there was an- absolute necessity
of doing it, my.first piece.of work was to find otit a
proper piece of ground, viz. where there was likely
..to be herbage for (them to eaty water for them to
•drink* and cover to keep them from the fun.
Those who understand such inclosures will think
,1 had very little contrivance, ^When I pitched upon
a. place verylpfoper for all tihef^being a plain open
.piece * of meadow-land or Savanna, (&s our people
xall it in the western coloniesv)-wiiich had two or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and -at 'one end
was very woody. I fay they will smile at my fore-
cast, when I shall tell them I began my inclosing
iof this piece of ground in such a manner, that my
ikedge or pale> must have been at least two miles
about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to
the compass, for if it was tenimiles about, I was
like to have time enough to do it in. But I did not
consider that my goats would be as wild in so much
compass
compass as if they had had the whole island, and I
sliould have so much room to chase them in, that I
should never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe
about fifty yards, when this thought occured-to me,
so I presently stopt short, and for the first begining,
I resolved to inclose a piece of about 150 yafds in
length, and 100 yards in breadth, which as it
would maintain as many as I should have in any rea-
sonable time, so as my stock- increased, I could add
more ground to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I
went to work with courage.1 I was about three
months hedgihg in the first piece, and till I had
done it I tethered the three kids in the best part of it,
and used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar $ and very^often I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, br a handful of rice, and
feed them out of my hand; so that after my enclo-
sure was finished; and I let them loose, they would
follow me up and (down bleating after mh£ for a
handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and
all s and in two years more I had three and forty,
besides several that I took and killed for my food.
And
And after that, I enclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with little pens tQ drive
them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates
wt of one piece of ground into another.
But this was not all, for now I not only had
goats flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too,
a thing which indeed in my begining I did not so
much as think of, and which, when it came into my
thoughts, was really an agreeable surprize, For
now I set up my dairy, and had some times a gallon
or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who gives
supplies of food to every creature, dictates even na-
turally how to make use of it; so I that had never
milked a cow, much less a goat, "or had scarcely
feen butter or cheese made, only when I was a boy,
t;hough after a great many essays and miscarriages,
made, me both butter and cheese at last, and also
salt, though I found it partly made to my hand, by
the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the
sea, and neyer wanted it afterwards. How mercy-
sully can our great creator treat his creatures, even
in those conditions in which they seemed to be over-
whelmed in destruction? How can he sweeten the
bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise
him for dungeons and prisons? What a table was
here spread for me in a wilderness, where I law
nothing at first but to perish for hunger.
It
237
It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen
me and my little family sit down to dinner there
was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my
absolute command. I could hang, draw, give
liberty and take it away, and no rebels among all
my subjects.
Then to fee how like a king I dined too, all
alone attended by my servants; Poll, as if he had
been my favourite, was the only person permitted
to talk to me. My dog who was now grown very
old and crazy, and had found no species to multi-
ply his kind upon, fat always at my right hand,
and two cats, one on one side the table, and one on
the other, expecting now and then a bit from my
hand as a mark of special favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought,
on Ihore at first, for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my
own hand, but one of them having multiplyed by I
know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I had prelerved tame, whereas the rest run
wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome
to me at last; for they would often come into my
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was oblig-
to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at
length they left me. With this attendance, and in
thi*
this plentiful manner I lived $ neither could I be
said to want any thing but society, and of that in
some time after this, I was like to have too much,
I Was something impatient, as I have dbserved,
to have the use of my boat, though very loth to run
any more hazards; and therefore sometimes I fat
contriving ways to get her about the island, and at
other times I fat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my
mind to go down to the point of the island, where,
as I have said in my last ramble, I went up the hill
to see how the shore lay, and how the current set,
that I might lee what I had to do: this inclination
encreased upon me every day, and at length I re-
solved to travel thither by land, following the edge
of the shore; I did so: but had any one in England
been to meet such a man as I was, it must either
have frightened him, or raised a great deal of laugh-
ter; and as I frequently stood still to look at myself,
I could not but smile at the notion os my travelling
-through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in
such a dress: be pleased to take a sketch of my
figure as follows.
I had a great high stiapeless cap, made of goat'&
Ikin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well
to keep the fun from me, as to Ihoot the rain off
from running into my neck j nothing being so hurt-
ful
*39
ful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh
under the cloaths.
I had a sliort jacket of goat-skin, the skirts
coming down to about the middle of my thighs;
and a pair of open kneed breeches of the fame, the
breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat,
whose hair hung down such a length on either side,
that like pantaloons it reached to the middle of my
legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but had
made me a pair of somethings, I scarce know what
to call them, like busldns to flap over my legs,
and lace on either side like spatter-dashes; but of a
most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest
of my cloaths.
I had on a broad belt of goat's (kin dryed,
which I drew together with two thongs of the fame,
instead of buckles, and in a kind of a frog. On
either side of this, instead of a sword and daggery
hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side,
and one on the other. I had another belt not so
broad, and fastened in the same manner, which
hung over my siioulder; and at the end of it, ufnder
my lest arm, hung two pouches, both made of
goat's skin too; in one of which hung my powder,
in the other my fliot: at my back I carried my
basket, and on my shoulder my gun, and over my
head a great clumsy ugly goat-ikin umbrella, but
\ which
which after all was the most necessary thing, I had
about me, next to my gun: as for my face, the
colour of it was really not so mulatto like, as one
might expect from a man not at all careful of it,
and living within nineteen degrees of the equinox.
My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was
about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both
icissars and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty
sliort, except what grew on my upper lip, which
I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan
whiskers, such as I had seen worn by the Turks,
whom I saw at Sallee; for the Moors did not
wear such, though the Turks did: of these musta-
chios or whiskers, I will not fay they were long
enough to hang my hat upon them; but they were
of a length and shape monstrous enough, and such
as in England would have passed for frightful.
But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure, I
had so few to observe, that it was of no manner of
consequence; so I say no more to that part. In
this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was
out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-
shore, directly to the place where I first brought my
boat to an anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and
having no boat now to take care of, I went over the
land a nearer way to the fame height that I was up-
on before, when looking forward to the point of the
rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to
double
ctouble with my boat, as is said above, I was sur-
prized to see the sea all smooth and quiet, no
ripling, no - motion, no current* any more there
than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and
resolved to spend some time in the observing it, to
see if nbthihg from the sets of the tide had occasioned
it; but I was presently convinced how it was, viz.
That the tide or ebb setting from the west, and
joining with the current of waters from some great
river on the stiore, must be the occasion of this
current; and that according as the wind blew
more forcibly from the west, or from the north,
this current came nearer j or went farther from the
shore; for waiting thereabouts till evening, I went
up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb
being made, I plainly saw the current again as
before, only that it ran farther off, being near half
a league from the sliore; whereas in my cafe, it set
close upon the sliore, and hurried me, and my canoe
along with it, which at another time it would not
have done.
This observation convinced me, that I had no-
thing to do, but observe the ebbing and the flowing
of the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat
about the island again; but when I began to think
of putting it in practice* I had such a terror upon
R my
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had
been in, that I could not think of it again with any
patience; but on the contrary, I took up another
resolution which was more safe, though more la-
borious; and this was, that I would build or rather
make me another periagua or canoe: and so have
one for one side of the island, and one for the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under
the rock; with the cave behind me, which by this
time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves,
one within another. One of these which was the
driest, and largest, and had a door out beyond my
wall or fortification; that is to fay, beyond where
my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up with
large earthen pots, of which I have given an ac-
count, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets,,
which would hold five or fix bushels each; where I
laid up my stores of provision; especially my corn*
some in the ear cut off short from the straw, and the
other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were
by this time grown so big, and spread so very much,,
that there was not the, least appearance to any one's
view of any habitation behind them.
Near,
Near this dwelling-of mine, but a little farther
Within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my
two -pieces of corn ground, which I kept daily
cultivated, and sowed, and which duly yielded me
their harvest, in its season *, and whenever I had
bccasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining
as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my country-seat, and 1 had
. now a tolerable plantation there also; for first I
had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in
repair; that is to fay, I kept the hedge which cir-
cled it in* constantly fitted up to its usual height,
the ladder standing always in the inside: I kept
the trees which at first were no more than my stakes,
but were now grown very firm and tall 5 I kept
them always so cut that they might spread, and
grow thick and wild:, and make the more agreeable
stiade, which they did effectually to my mind. In
the middle of this I had my tent always standing,
being a piece of a fail spread over poles set up for
that purpose, and which never wanted any repair
br renewing, and under this I had made me a
squab or couch, with the skins of the creatures I
had killed, and with other soft things, and a blan-
ket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea
bedding which I had saved, and a great watch coat
: to cover me; arid here, whenever I had occasion to
be
be absent from my chief seat I took up my country
habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my
cattle, that is to fay, my goats; and as I had
taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and
enclose this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept
entire, lest the goats should break through, that
I never left off 'till with infinite labour I had stuck
the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes,
and so near to one another, that it was rather a
pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to
put a hand through between them, v/hich after-
wards when those stakes grew, as they all did in
the next rainy season, made the enclosure strong
like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle,
and that I spared no pains to bring to pass what-
ever appeared necessary for my comfortable sup-
port; for I considered the keeping up a breed of
tame,creatures thus at my hand, would be a living
magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for
me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be
forty years, and that keeping them in my reach,
depended entirely upon my perfectingmy enclosures
to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping
them together > which by this method indeed I so
effectually secured, that when these little stakes
be-
began to grew, I had planted them so very thick
I was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter store of.
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable
only, but physical, wholfome, and refreshing to
the last degree.
As this was also about half way between my other
habitation, and the place where I had laid up my
boat, I generally stayed, and lay here in my
way thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat
and I kept all things about or belonging to her in
very gpod order 5 sometimes I went out in her to
divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages
would I go, nor scarce even above a stone's cast or
two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being
hurried out of my knowledge again by the cur-
rents, or winds, or any other accident: but now I
came to a new scene of my life.
It happened one day about noon going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprized with the
print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which
was very plain to be seen in the sand: I stood like one
thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an apparition;
R .3 1 listen-
ADVENTURES OF
I listened, I looked round me, I could hea|*
nothing, nor see any thing; I went up to a
rising ground to look farther, I went up the fhore^
and down the shore but it was all one, I could fee
no other impression but that ope; I went to it again
to fee if there were any more, and to observe if it
might not be my fancy; but there was no room for
that, for there was exactly the very print of a foot,
tQ.es, heel, and every part of a foot; how came it
thither I knew not, nor could I- in the least
imagine; but after innumerable fluttering thoughts,
like a man-perfectly confused and out of myself, I
came home, to my fortification, not feeling, as we
fay, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last
degree, looking behind me at eyery two or three
steps, mistaking every bufli and tree, and fancying
eyery stump at a distance, to be a man: Nor is it
possible to describe how pnany various slopes my
affrighted imagination represented things to me in,
how many wild ideas were fpund every moment in
my fancy, and what strange unaccountable
whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued^
whether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived,
or went in at the hole "in the rock, which I called
a door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I
remember the next morning, for neves frighted
hare
hare , fled to cover, or sox to earth, with more
terror of mind fhan I to this retreat.
I slept none that night; the farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my appre-
hensions were, which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear; But I was so
embarassed with my own frightful ideas of the
thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imagi-
nations to myself, even though I was now a great
way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the
devil, and reason joined with me upon this sup-
position; for how should any other tiling in human'
lhape come into the place? Where was the vessel
that brought them? What marks were there of
any other footsteps? And how was it possible a
man should come there? But then to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such
a place, where there could be no manner of occa-
sion for it, but to leave the print of his foot be-
hind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he
coijld not be sure I should see it; this was an
amusement the other way; I considered that ^he
devil might have found out abundance of other
ways to, have terrified me, rather than this of the
single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the
other side of the ifland, he would never have been
so simple to leave a mark in a place where it was
R 4 ten
ten thousand to one whether I stiould ever see h
or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge
of the sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced
entirely: all this seemed inconsistent with the
thing itself, and with all the notions we usually
entertain of the subtilty of the devil.
Abundance of such things as those assisted to
argue me out of all the apprehensions of its being
the devil; and I presently concluded then, that it
must be some more dangerous creature,, viz. that
it must be some of the savages of the main land
over-against me, who had wandered out to sea in
their canoes, and either driven by the currents or
by contrary winds, had made the island, and had
been on ihore, but were gone away again to sea,
being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this
desolate island, as I would have been to have hac^
them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my
mind, I was very thankful in my thoughts that I
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,
or that they did not fee my boat, by which they
would have concluded that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched far-
ther for me: then terrible thoughts racked my
imagination,, about their finding out my boat,
and that there were people here; and that if they
did
slid I sliould certainly have them come again in
. greater numbers, and devour me; that if it sliould
happen so that they sliould not find me, yet they
would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn,
carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I sliould
perisli at last for mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hopes,
all that former confidence in God which was
founded upon such wonderful experience as I had
had of his goodness now vanished, as if he that had
fed me by miracle hitherto, could, not preserve by
his power, the provision which he had made for
me by his goodness: I reproached myself with my
laziness that would not sow any more corn one
year than would just serve me till the next season,
as if no accident would intervene to prevent my
/enjoying the .crop that was upon the ground j and
this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved
for the future to have two or three years corn be-
fore hand, so that whatever might come I might
not perisli for want of bread.
How strange a' chequer-work of providence is
the life of man, and by what secret different springs
are the affections hurried about as different cir-
cumstances present! to-day we love, what to-mor-
row we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we
shun; to-day we desire /what to-morrow we fear,
nay
\ '
ADVENTURES OF
nay even tremble at the apprehensions of; this was.
-exemplified in me at this time in the most lively
manner imaginable; for I whose only affliction was,
that I seemed banished from human society, that
I was alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean,
cut off from mankind, and condemned to what
I called silent life; that I was as one whom hea-
ven thought, not worthy to be numbered among
the living, or to appear among the rest of his
creatures \ that to have seen one of my own spe-
cies, would have seemed to me a raising me from
death to life, and the greatest blessing that heaven
itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation,
could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble
at die very apprehensions of seeing a man, and
was ready to sink into the ground at but the
stiadow or silent appearance of man's haying set
his foot in the island,'
Such is the uneven'state of human life; and
it afforded me a great many curious speculations
afterwards when I had a- little recovered my first
surprize: I considered, that this was the station
of life the ir finitely wife and good providence of
God had determined for me j that as I could not;
foresee what the - ends of divine wisdom might be
in all this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty
who, as I was his creature, had undoubted right
by creation to govern and dispose of me absolute-
ly as he thought sit, and who, as I was a crea-
ture that had offended him, had likewise a judicial
sight to condemn me to what punishment he
thought fit, and that it wasx my part to submit to
bear his indignation^ because I had sinned against
Jhiixu
I then reflected, that God, who was not only-
righteous but omnipotent, as he had thought fit
thus to punish and afflict nae, so he was able to
deliver me; that if he did not think fit to doit,
it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself ab-
solutely and entirely to his will: and, on the
pther hand, it was my duty also to hope in him,
pray to him, and quietly to attend the dictates and
directions of his daily providence.
These thoughts, took me up many hours, days,
nay, 'I may fay, weeks and months; and one
particular .effect of my cogitations on this occasion
I cannot omit, viz. one morning early lying in
my bed, and filled with thoughts about my dan-
ger from the appearance of savages, I found it
discomposed me very much, upon which those
words of the scripture came into my thoughts,
t€ Call upon me in the day of trouble and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me/
Upon
Upon this rising chearfully out of my bed,
my heart was not only comforted, but I was
guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God
for deliverance: when I had done praying, I took
N up my bible and opening it to read, the first words
that presented to me, were "Wait on the Lord,
and be of good cheer and he sliall strengthen thy
heart; wait, I say on the Lord." It is impossible
to express the comfort this gave me. In answer,
I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more
fad, at least on that occasion.,
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reflections, it came into my 'thoughts one?
day, that all this might be a mere chinqæra of my
'own, and that this foot might be the print of my
own foot, when I came on fliore from my boat;
this cheered me up a little too, and I began to
persuade myself it was all a delusion, that it was
nothing else but my own foot, and why might
not I come that way from the boat, as well as I
was going that way to the boat * Again, I con-
sidered alSso that I could by no means tell for cer-
tain where I had trod, and where I had not; and
that if at last this was only the print of my pwn
foot, I had played the part of those fools ^hg
strive to make stories of spectres and apparitions,
and then are frighted at them more than any
body.
Now
Now I began to take courage, and to peep
abroad again, for I had not stirred out of my
castle for three days and nights, so that I began
to starve for provisions; for I had little or no-
thing within doors but some barley cakes and
water: then I knew that my goats wanted to be
milked too, which usually was my evening di-
version $ and the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of it, and I found
by experience that it had done them abundance of
hurt to neglect milking them*
Heartening myself therefore with the belief
that this was nothing but the print of one of my
own feet, and so I might be truly said to start at;
my own shadow, I began to go abroad again,
and went to my country-house to milk my flock;
but to see with what fear I went forward, how
often I looked behind me, how I was ready every
now and then to lay down my basket and run for
my life ; it would have made any one have thought
I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that
I had been lately most terribly frighted, and sa
indeed I had.
However, as I went dowTn thus two or three
days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a
little bolder, and to think there was really no-
thing in it but my own imagination j but I could
not
Al)VENTukfeS OF
hot persuade myself fully of this, till I fhotikl
go down to the sliore again, and fee this print
of a foot and measure it by my own, and fee if
there was any similitude or fitness, that I might
be assured it was my own foot; but when I
came to the place, first, it appeared evidently to(
me, that when I laid up my boat I could not
possibly be on sliore any where thereabout. Se-
condly when, I came to measure the mark with
my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great
deal; both these things filled my head with new
imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to
the highest degree, so that I sliook with cold like
one in an ague; and I went home again, filled
with the belief that some man or men had beer*
on shore there: or, in short that the island was
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was-
aware; and what course to take for my security
I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take when
possessed with fear! it deprives them of the use
of those means which reason offers for their relief,
The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw
down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle
wild into the woods, lest the enemy sliould find
them, and then frequent the island in prospect of
the same, or the like booty, then to the simple
thing of digging up my two corn fields, lest they
should
should find such a grain there, and still be prompt-
ed to frequent the island; then to demolish my
bower and tent, that they might not see any ves-
tages of habitation, and be prompted to look far-
ther, in order to find put the persons inhabiting.
These were the subject of the first night's
cogitation after I was come home again while the
apprehensions which had so over-run my mind were
freih upon me, and my head was as full of va-
pours, as above: thus fear of danger is ten thou-
sand times more terrifying than danger itself, when
apparent to the eyes; and we find the burthen of
anxiety greater by much than the evil which we
are anxious about \ and which was worse than all
this, I had not that relief in this trouble vfrom
the resignation I used to practise that I hoped to
have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who com-
plained not only that the Philistines were upon him,
but that God had forsaken him; for I did not
now take "due ways to compose my mind by
crying ta God in my distress, and resting upon
his providence, as I had .done before, for my de-
fence and deliverance; which if I had done, I
had at least been more chearfully supported under
this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it
with more resolution.
2 This
This confusion of my thoughts kept me wait-
ing all night, but in the morning I fell asleepy
and having, by the amusement of my mind been^
as it were tired and my spirits exhausted, 1 slept
very soundly, and waked much better composed
than I had ever been before and now I began
to think sedately, and upon the utmost debate
with myself, I concluded, that this island which
was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther
from the main land than as I had seen, was not so
entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that al-
though there were no stated inhabitants who
lived on the spot, yet that there might some-
times come boats off from the siiore, who either
with, design, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by cross winds, might come to this place;
that I had lived here fifteen years now, and had
not met with the least shadow or figure of any
people yet; and that if at anytime they should
be driven here, it was probable they went away
again as soon as ever they could, feeing they had
never thought fit to six here upon any occasion to
this time; that the most I could suggest any dan^
ger from was from any such casual accidental land-
ing of stragglings people from the main, who, as:
it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here
against their wills; so they made no stay here, but
went off again with all possible speed, seldom stay-
ing, one night on shore, lest they sliould not have
the
257
tKc help of the tides, and day-light back again;
and that therefore I had nothing to do, but to con-
sider of some safe retreat, in cafe I should fee any
savages land upon the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent that, I had dug
my cave so large as to bring a door through again,
Which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock upon maturely
considering this therefore, I resolved to draw me
a second fortification, in the same manner, of a
semi-circle, at a distance from my wall just where
I had planted a double row of trees about twelve
years before, of which I made mention: these
trees having been planted so thick before, they
Wanted but a few piles to be driven between them,
that they should be thicker and stronger, and my
wall would be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old
cables, and every thing I could think of, to make
it strong j having in it seven littles holes, about
as big as I might put my arm out at, in the
inside of this I thickened my wall to above ten
feet thick, with continual bringing earth put of my
cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall and
Walking upon it; and through the seven holes
I contrived to plant the musquets, of which I
S took
\
ADVENTURES OF
took notice that I got seven on shore out of the
ship \ these I say, I plante,d like my cannon, and
fitted them into frames that held them like a car-
riage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in
two minutes time: this wall I was many a weary
month a finishing, and yet never thought myself
safe till it was done.
When this was done I stuck all the ground
Without my wall, for a great length every way,
as full with stakes or sticks, of the osier like wood,
which I found so apt to grow, as they could well
stand; insomuch that 1 believe I might set in near
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large
space between them and my wall that I might
have room to see an enemy, and they might have
no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer wall.
Thus in two years time I had a thick grOve,
and in five or six years time I had a wood before
my dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and
strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable, and
no men of what kind soever would ever imagine
that there was any thing beyond it* much less a
habitation: as for the way which I proposcd.to my-
self to go in and out, for I left no avenue^ it was by
setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which
was low, and then broke in, and left room to
. place
another ladder upon that; so when the two lad-
ders were taken down, no man living could come
down to me without mischieving himself; and if
they had come down they were still on the outside
os my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation; and it
will be seen at length, that they were not alto-
gether without just reason; though I foresaw no-
thing at that time more than my mere sear sug-
gested to me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether
careless of my other affairs; for I had a great
concern upon me for my little herd of goats; they
were not only a present supply to me on every
occasion, and began to be sufficient for me with-
out the expence of powder and sliot, but also with-
out the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones j
and I was loth to lose the advantage of them and
to have them all to nurse up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I
could think of but two ways to preserve them;
one was to find another convenient place to dig
a cave under ground, and to drive them into it
every night; and the other was to enclose two or
three little bits of land, remote from one another
$ 1 and
\
ADVENTURES- as
and as much concealed as I could, where I might
keep about half a dozen young goats in each
place; so that if .any disaster happened to the flock
in general, I might be able to raise them again
with little trouble and time: and this, though it
would require a great deal of time and labour,
I thought was the most rational design.
Accordingly I 'spent some time to find out the
most retired part of the island j and I pitched upon
one which was as private indeed as my heart
could wish for, it was a little damp piece of
ground in the middle of the hollow and thick
woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself
once before, endeavouring to come back that way
from the eastern part of the island: here I found
a clear piece of land near three acres, so sur-
rounded with woods that it was almost an en-
closure by nature, at least it did not want near
so much labour to make it so as the other pieces
of ground I had worked so hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground, and in less than a month's time I had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it
which you please, who were not so wild now as at
first they might be supposed to be, were well
enough secured ink: so, without any farther delay,
I removed ten young she goats and two he-goats to
this,
this piece; and when they were there, I continued
to perfect the fence, till I had made it as secure as
the other, which, however, I did at more leisure,
and it took me up more time by a great deal. All
this labour I was at the expence of, purely from
my apprehensions on the account of the print of
a man's foot, which I had seen: for as yet I never
saw any human creature come near the island, and
I had now lived two years under these uneasinesses,
which indeed made my life much less comfortable
than it was before; as may well be imagined by
any who know what it is to live in the constant
snare of the fear of man; and this I must observe
with grief too, that the discomposure of my mind,
had too great impressions also upon all the religious
part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of
falling into the hands of savages and cannibals, lay
so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in
a due temper for application to my maker, at least
not with the sedate calmness and resignation of loul
which I was wont to do; I rather prayed to God, as
under great affliction and pressure of mind, surround-
ed with danger, and in expectation every night of
being murthered and devoured before morning : And
I must testify from my experience, that a temper of
peace, thankfulness, love and assection, is much
. more the proper frame for prayer than that of terror
and discomposure i and that under the dread of mis-
chief impending, a man is no more sit for a com-
S 3 sorting
\
sorting performance of the duty of praying to God,
than he is for a repentance on a sick bed; for these
discomposures affect the mind as the others do the,
body; and the discomposure of the mind must ne-
cessarily be as great a disability as that of the body,
and much greater; praying to God being properly
an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to goon: after I had thus secured one part
of my little living stock, I went about the whole
island, searching for another private place to make;
such another deposit, when wandering more to the;
west point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat
upon the sea at a great distance. I had found a
perspective glass or two, in one of the seamen's
chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had it*
not about me: and this was so remote that I could
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it
till my eyes were not able to hold to look any long-
er; whether it was a boat or not, I do not know,
but as I descended from the hill, I could see no more
of it, so I gave it over, only I resolved to go no
more out without a perspective glass in my pocket.
When I was come down the hill, to the end
of the island, where indeed I had never been before,
I was presently convinced, that the seeing the print
of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the
island
263
island as I imagined j and but that it was a special
providence that I was cast upon the side of the island
where the savages never came, I should easily have
known that nothing was more frequent than the ca-
noes from the main, when they happened to be a
little too far out at sea to shoot over to that side of
the island for harbour ; likewise as they often met and
fought in their canpes, the victors having taken
any prisoners would bring them over to this shore,
where according to their dreadful customs, being all
cannibals, they would kill and eat them 5 of which
hereafter,
When I was come down the hill to the shore, a$
I said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I
was perfectly confounded and amazed, nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind at
seeing the stiore spread with skulls, hands, feet, an4
other bones of human bodies; and particularly I
observed a place where there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit,
where it is supposed the savage wretches had fat
down to their inhuman feastings, upon the bodies
of their fellow creatures,
I was so astonished with the sight of these things
that I entertained no notions of my danger to my^
self from it, for a long while: all my apprehensions
were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of
S 4 inhuman,
\
inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the
degeneracy of human nature, which though I had
heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of be-
fore; in lhort, I turned away my face from the
horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was
just at the point of fainting when nature discharged
the disorder from my stomach, and having vomit-
ed with an uncommon violence, I was a little relieved,
but could not bear to stay in the place a moment;
so I got me up the hill again with all the speed I
.could, and walked on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the
island, I stood still a while, as amazed, and then
recovering myself I looked up with the utmost af-
fection of my soul, and with a flood of tears in my
eyes/ gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot
in a part df the world where I was distinguished
from such" dreadful creatures as these; and that
though I had esteemed my present condition very
miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in
It, that I had still more to give thanks for than to
complain of; and this above all, that I had even
in this miserable condition been comforted with
the knowledge of himself, and the hope of his
blessing, .which was a felicity more than sufficiently
equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered or
could suffer.
\.
In
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to
my castle, and began to be much easier now as to
the safety of my circumstances than ever I was be-
fore: for I observed, that these wretches never
came to this island, in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, nor wanting, or not
expecting any thing here; and having often, no
doubt, been up in the covered woody part of it,
without finding any thing to their purpose. I knew
I had been here now almost eighteen years, and
never saw the least footsteps of human creature
there before and I might be eighteen years more
as entirely concealed, as I was now, if I did not -
discover myself to them, which I had no manner of
occasion to do, it being my only business to keep
myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I
found a better fort of creatures than canibals to
make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches, that I have been speaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom, of their devouring and
eating one another up, that I continued pensive and
sad and kept close within my own circle for almost
two years after this: when I fay my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations, viz. my castle, my
country-seat, which I called my bower, and my
enclosure in the woods; nor did I look at this
flfter for any other use than as an enclosure for my
goats y
\
goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to
these hellish wretches was fuchy that I was as fearful
of seeing them, as of seeing the devil himself $ nor
did I so much as go to look after my boat, in all
this time, but began rather to think of making me
another; for I could not think of ever making any-
more attempts to bring the other boat round the
island to me, least I sliould meet with some of
these creatures at lea; in which if I had happened
to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would
have been my lot*
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that
I was in no danger of being discovered by these
people, began to wear off my uneasiness about
them, and I began to live just in the fame composed
manner as before, only with this difference, that I
used more caution, and kept my eyes more about
me than I did before, lest I should happen to be
seen by any of them$ and particularly, I was more
cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them being
on the island should happen to hear it, and it
was therefore a very good providence to xnc that I
had furnished myself with a tame kind of goats that
I need not hunt any more abont the woods, pr
shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after
this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done be-
fore; so that for two years after this, I believe I
never fired my gun once off, though I never went
put
267
put without it; and which was more, as I had saved
three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them
out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them
iji my goats-skin belts also I furbished up one of
the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and
made me a belt to put it on also; so that I was now
a most formidable fellow to look at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of my-
self, the particular of two pistols, and a great'broad
sword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a
scab^ardo
Thinqs going on thus, as I have said, for some
time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be re-
duced to my former calm sedate way os living: all
these things tended to shewing me more and more,
how far my condition was from being miserable,
compared to some others; nay, to many other
particulars of life, which it might have pleased
God to have made my lot. It put me upon reflect-
ing, how little repining there would be among
mankind, at any condition of life, if people would
rather Compare their condition with those diat were
worse, in order to be thankful, than be always
comparing them with those which are bettei", to
assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that
\
that the frights that I had been in about these sa-
vage wretches, and the concern I had been in for
my own preservation, had taken off the edge of
my invention, for my own conveniences: and I
had dropped a good design which I had once bent
my thoughts too much upon, and that was to try
if I could not make some of my barley into malt,
and then try to brew myself some beer: this was
really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself
often for the simplicity of it; for I presently saw,
there would be the want of several things necessary
to the making my beer, that it would be impossible
for me to supply; as first, casks to preserve it in,
which was a thing that, as I have observed already,
I could never compass; no, though I spent not
only many days, but weeks, nay months, in at-
tempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place,
I had no hopes to make it keep, no yeast to make
it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil, and
yet all these things notwithstanding, I verily believe
had not these things intervened, I mean the frights
and terrors I was in about the savages, I had under-
taken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too: for I
seldom gave any thing over without accomplishing
it, when once I had it in my head enough to begin
it. But my inventions, now ran quite another way,
for night and day, I could think of nothing but
how I might destroy some of these monsters in their
cruel bloody entertainment, and if possible save the
victim
victim they should bring hither to destroy. It
would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to to be, to set down all the con-
trivances I hatched or rather brooded upon in my
thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at
least frighting them, so as to prevent their com-
ing hither any more; but all was abortive,
nothing could be possible to take effect, unless I
was to be there to do it myself -9 and what could one
man do among them, when perhaps there might
be twenty or thirty of them together with their darts,
or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five or
six pounds of gun powder, which, when they kindled
their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up
all that was near it; but as in the first I should be
very loth to waste so much powder upon them,
my store being now within the quantity of one
barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off
at any certain time, when it might surprize them,
and at best, that it would do little more than just
blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but
not sufficient to make them forsake the place; so I
laid it aside, and then proposed, that I would
place myself in ambush in some convenient place,
with
\
with my three guns all double loaded, and in this
middle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them*
when I slionld be lure to kill or wound perhaps
two or three at every sliot: and then falling in
upon them with my three pistols, and my sword, I
made on doubt, but that if there was twenty I should
kill them all: this fancy pleased my thoughts for
some weeks, and I was so full of it, that I often
dreamed of it; and sometimes that I was just going
to let fly at them in my steep* I went so far with
it in my imagination, that I employed myself several
days to find out proper places to put myself in am-
buscade, as I said, to watch for them; and I went
frequently to the place itself, which was now
grown more familiar to me; and especially while
my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge,
and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to
the sword, as. I may call it j the horror I had at the;
place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches
devouring one another, abetted my malice. Well, at
length I found a place in the side of the hill, where I
was satisfied I might securely wait, till I saw any of
their boats coming; and might then, even before
they would be ready to come; on sliore, convey
myself unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of
which there was a hollow large enough to conceal
me entirely; and where 1 might sit, and observe
all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at
th^ir heads, when they were so close together, as,
that
2Jt
that it would be next to impossible that I would
miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding threq
or four of them at the first shot. In this place
then I resolved to fix my design, and accordingly
I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling
piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace of
slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about
the size of pistol bullets •> and the fowling piece I
loaded with near a handful of fwan-fhot, of the
largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about
four bullets each, and in this posture, well provi-
ded with ammunition for a second and third charge
I prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme of my design,
and in my imagination put it in practice, I continu-
ally made my tour every morning up to the top of
the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it,
about three miles, or mor&, to fee if I could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or
standing over towards it -9 but I began to tire of this
hard duty, after I had for two or three months
constantly kept my watch; but came always back
without anyt discovery, there having not in all
that time been the least appearance, not only on,
or near the shore, but not on the whole ocean, so
far as my eyes or glasses could reach every way,
a As
\
As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill, ttf
look out so long also I kept up the vigour of my
design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while
in a suitable from, for so outragious an execution
as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for
an offence which I had not at all entered into a
discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my pas-
sions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at
the unnatural custom of the people of that country,,
who it seems had been suffered by providence in his
wife disposition of the world, to have no other
guide than that of their own abominable and
vitiated passions \ and consequently were left, and
perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such
horrid things, and receive such dreadful customsy
as nothing but nature entirely abandoned of heaven,,
and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have
run them into: But now, when as I have said, I
began to be weary of the fruitless excursion, which I
had made so long, and so far, every morning in vain,-
so my opinion of the action itself began to alter,
and I began with cooler and calmer thoughts to
consider what it was I was going to engage in,
what authority, or call I had to pretend to be
judge and executioner upon these men as, criminals,
whom heaven had thought fit of so many ages to-
suffer unpunished, to go on, and to be as it were,
the executioners of his judgments one upon another.
How far these people were offenders against me,
x and
and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of
that blood, which they Ihed promiscuoufly upon
•one another, I debated this veryv often with myself
thus; how do I know what God himself judges in
this particular cafe; 'tis certain these people either
<do not commit this as a crime; 'tis not against:
their own consciences reproving, or their light
reproaching them; they do not know it to be
an offence, and then commit it in defiance of di-
vine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we
fcommit. They think it no more a crime to kill
& captive taken iri war, than we do to kill an ox;
hor to eat human flelh, than we do to eat mutton.
When I considered this a little, it followed ne-
cessarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it,
that these people were not murtherers in the sense
that I had before condemned them in my thoughts,
any more than those christians were murtherers, who
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or
more frequently^ upon many occasions, put whole
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter,
though they threw down their arms and submitted.
In the next place it occured to me, that albeit the
tisage they thus gave one another, was thus brutisti
aad inhuman^ yet it was really nothing to me;
these people had done me no injuryi That if they
attempted me, or I saw it necessary for immediate
perservation to fall upon them, something might
be said for it; but that as I was yet out of their
T , power,
\
ADVENTURES OF
power, and' they had really no knowledge os me,,
and consequently no design upon me; and there-
fore it could not be just to fall upon them. That
this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards
in all their barbarities practised in America, and
where they destroyed millions of these people,
who however they were idolators and barbarians,
and had several bloody and barbarous rites in
their customs, such as sacrificing human bodies
to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very
innocent people; and that the rooting them out
of the country, is spoken of with the utmost ab-
horrence and detestation, by even the Spaniards
themselves at this time, and by all other christian
nations in Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody
and unnatural piece of cruelty unjustifiable either
to God or man •> and such as for which the very
name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful
and terrible to all people of humanity, or of
christian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain
were particularly eminent for the product of a race
of men, who were without principles of tenderness
or the common bowels of pity to the miserable,
which is reckoned to be a mark of generous tem-
per in the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause,
and to a kind of a full stop, and I began by
little and little to be off of my design, and to
conclude
conclude I had taken wrong measures in my re-
solution to attack the savages; that it was not my
business to meddle with them, unless they first
attacked me, and this it was my business if pos-
sible to prevent: but that if I were discovered
and attacked then I knew my duty. On the ether
hand-, I argued with myself cc that this really was
the way not to deliver myself but entirely to ruin
and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill
every one that not only should be on shore at that
time* but that should ever come on shore after-
wards, if but one of them escaped to tell their
country people what had happened they would
come over again by thousands to revenge the death
of their fellows, and I should only bring upon
myself a certain destruction, which at present I
had no manner of occasion for/' Upon the whole
I concluded cc that neither in principle or in
policy I ought one way or other to concern my-
lelf in this affair." That my business was by all
possible means to conceal myself from them, ^and
not to leave the least signal to them to guess by,
that there were any living creatures upon the
island, I mean of human sliape.
Religion joined in with this prudential resolution,
1 was convinced now many ways that I was perfectly
out of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody
schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures,
T 2 I mean .
\
I mean innocent as to me: as tQ the crimes they
were guilty of towards one another I had nothing
to do with them, they were national, and I ought
to leave them to the justice of God, who is the
governor of nations, and knows how by national
punishments to make a just retribution for national
Offences, and to bring public judgments upon those
who offend in a public manner, by such ways as
best please him*
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had
not been suffered to do a thing which I how saw
so much reason to believe would have been no
iess a sin than that of wilful murther if I had
committed it -y and I gave most humble thanks on
my knees to God, that had thus delivered me
from blood guiltiness, beseeching him to grant me
the protection of his providence, that I might
not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that
I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I
had a more clear call from haven to do it, in
defence of my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year
after this; and so far was I from desiring an oc-
casion for falling upon these wrethes, that in all
that time I never once went up the hill to fee
whether there where any of them in sight,- or to
know
konw whether any of them had been on shore
there or not, that I might not be tempted to
renew any of my contrivances against them, or
be provoked by any advantage which might pre-
sent itself to fall upon them; only this I did, I
went and removed my boat, which I had on the
other side of the island, and carried it down to
the east end of the whole island, where I ran it
into a little cove which I found under some high
rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the cur-
rents, the savages durst not, at least would not
come with their boats, upon any account what-
soever. With my boat I carried away every thing
that I had left there belonging to her, though
not necessary for the bare going thither, viz a
mast and sail which I had made for her and $
thing like an anchor, but indeed which could not
either be called anchor or grappling; however,
it was the best I could make of its kind: all these
I removed, that there might not be the least sha-
dow of any discovery, or any apperance of any
boat, or of any human habitation upon the island.
Besides this I kept myself, as I said, more retir-
ed than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other
than upon my constant employment viz. to milk
my stie-goats, and manage my little flock in the
wood, which as it was quite on the other part
of the island was quite out of danger; for certain
it is that these savage people, who sometimes
T 3 haunted
haunted this island, never came with any thoughts
of finding any thing here, and consequently never
wandered off from the coasts and I doubt not but
they might have been several times on ihore, after
my apprehensions of them had made me cautious
as well as before -y and indeed I looked back with
some horror upon the thoughts of what my con-
dition would have been if I had choped upon them
and been discoved before that, when naked and
unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaden
often only with small {hot, I walked every where
peeping and peering about the island, to see what
I could get; what a surprize should I have been
in, if when I discovered the print of a man's foot,
I had instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty sa-
vages, and found them pursuing me, and by the
swiftness of their running, no possibility of my
escaping them. The thoughts of this sometimes
funk my very foul within me, and distressed my mind
so much, that I could not soon recover it, to
think what I should have done and hoyr I not only
should not have been able to resist them, but even
should not have had presence of mindenough to
do what I might have done \ much less, what now
after so much consideration and perparatiem, I
might be able to do: indeed after serious thinking
of these things, I would be very melancholy, and
sometimes it would last a great while but I re-
solved it all at last into thankfulness to that
pro-
providence which had delivered me from so many
unforeseen dangers, and had kept from me those
mischiefs which I could no way have been the
£gent in delivering myself from, because I had
nofthe least notion of any such thing depending,
or the least supposition of its being possible. This
renewed a contemplation which often had corne to
my thoughts in former time, when first I began
to fee the merciful disposition of heaven, in the
dangers we run through in this life; how won-
derfully we are delivered when we know nothing
of it; how when we are in (a quandary, as we
call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this
way, or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this
wey; nay, when fense, our own inclination, and
perhaps business has called to go the other way,
yet a strange impression upon the mind, from we
know not what springs, and by we know not what:
power, shall over rule us to go this way j and it
shall afterwards appear, that had we gone that
>vay, which we should have gone, and even to
our imagination, ought to have gone, we should
have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and many
like reflections, I afterwards made it a certain rule
with me, that whenever I found those lecret hints or
pressings of my mind, to doing, or not doing
any thing that presented $ or going this way or
that way, I never failed to obey the secret dic-
tate; though I knew no other reason for it, than
T 4 that
\
ADVENTURES OF
that such a pressure, or such a hint hung upon
my mind: I could give many examples of the suc-
cess of this conduct in the course of my life, but
more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting
this unhappy island; besides many occasions which
is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I
had seen with the same eyes then, that I fee with
now; but it is never too late to be wife; and I
cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives
are attended with such extraordinary incidents as
mine, or even though not fp extraordinary, not to
slight.. such secret intimations of providence, let
them come from what invisible intelligence they
will, that I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot
account for; but certainly they are a proof of
the converse of spirits, and a secret communic-
ation between those embodied, and those un~
embodied, and such a proof as can never be with-
stood; of which I shall have occasion to. give some
very remarkable instances in the remainder of my
solitary residence in this dismal place,
I believe the reader of this will not think it
strange if I confess that these anxieties, these con-
stant dangers I lived in, that the concern that was
now upon me, put an end to all invention, and'to
all the contrivances that I had laid for my future
accommodations and conveniences. I had the
care of my safety more now upon my hands than
that
fhat of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop
a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I stiould
make stiould be heard $ much lesi would I fire a,
gun, for the same reason] and above all, I was
intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the
day stiould betray me, and for this reason I
removed that part of my business which required
fire, such as burning of pots, and pipes, &c. into
my new apartment in the woods, where after I had
been some time, I found to my unspeakable con-
solation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which
went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no
savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be
so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed wrould any
man else; but one who like me, wanted nothing so
much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow, was at the bottom of
a great rock, where by mere accident, (J would
fay, if I did not fee abundant reason, to ascribe
all such things jiow to providence) I was cutting
down some thick branches of trees, to make char-
coal and before I go on, I must observe the
reason of my making this charcoal; which was
thus,
I was afraid of making a smoak about my habita-
tion, as I said before 5 and yet I could not live
there
\
Adventures of
there without baking my bread, cooking my meat,
&c» so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I
had seen done in England, under turf, till it be-
came chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire
out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and per-
form the other services for which fire was wanting
at home without danger of smoak.
But this is by the bye: while I was cutting
down some wood here, 1 perceived that behind a
very thick branch of low brush wood, or under
wood, there was a, kind of hollow place, I was
curious to look in it, and getting with difficulty
into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large j
that is to fay, sufficient for me to stand upright in
it, and perhaps another with me, but I must
confess to you, that I made more haste out than I
did in, when looking farther into the place, which
wras dark, I saw two bright shining eyes of some
creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which
twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the
cave's mouth shining in a little, and making thfi
reflection plainer.
However, after some pause, I recovered my-*
self, and began to call myself a thousand fools,
and tell myself, 6 c that he that was afraid of the
Devil, was not fit to live twenty years in an island
all alone." and that I might well think there was
nothing in this cave, that was more frightful than
myself
myself. Upon this plucking up my courage, I
took up a firebrand, and rushed in again, with the
stick flaming in my hand; 1 had not gone three
steps in, but I was almost as much frighted as I
yyas before, for I heard a very loud sigh, like that
of a man in some pain, and it was followed by
a broken noise, as if of words half expressed, and
then a deep sigh again: I stepped back, and was
indeed struck \yith such a surprize, that it put me
into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head,
I will not answer for it, that my hair might not
have lifted it off. But still plucking up my spirits
as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little
with considering that the power and presence of
God was every where, and >vas ^ble to protect: me;
upon this I stepped forward again, and by the
light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my
head, I saw lying on the ground, a most monstrous
frightful old he goat, just making his will, as we
fay, and galping for life, and dying indeed of
mere old age.
I stirred him a little, to fee if I could get him
out, and he essayed to get up, bi|t was not able to
rise himself5 and I thought with myself, he might
even lye there; for if he had frighted me so, he
would certainly fright any of the ftvages, if any of
them should be so hardy, as to coi^ie in there,
while he had any life in him.
\
I WAS
I was now recovered from my surprize, and
began to look round me, when I found the cave
was but very small, that is to fay, it might be.
about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape,
neither round or square, no hands, having ever'been
employed in making it, but those of meer nature: I
observed also, that there was a place at the farther
side of it, that went in farther, but was so low,
that it required me to creep upon my hands and
knees, to go into it, and whither it went I knew
not j ib having no candle, I gave is over for some
time; but resolved to come again the next day,
provided with candles, and a tinder box, which I
had made of the lock of one of the muskets, irfrith
some wild fire in the pan,
Accordingly the next day, I came provided
with six large candles of my own making; (for I
made candles now of goat's tallow, but was hard
set for candle wick; using sometimes rags or rope
yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like
nettles;) and going into this low place, I was
obliged to creep upon all fours as I have said, al-
most ten yards; which by the way, I thought wai
a venture bold enough, considering that I knew
not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it.
When I was got through the strait, I found the
roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet;
but never was such a glorious sight seen in the
islands
island, I dare fay, as it was, to look round the
sides and roof of this vault, or cave, the wall
reflected an hundred thousand lights to me from my
two candles; 'what it was in the rock, whether
diamonds, or any other precious stones, or gold,
which I rather supposed it to .be, I knew not.
The place I was in, was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark, the- floor was dry and level, and
had a fort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that
there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be
seen, neither Was there any damp qr wet, on the
sides or roof: the only difficulty in it was the en-
trance, which however as it was a place of security,
and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a
convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the
discovery, and resolved without any delay, to
bring some of those things, which I was most
anxious about, to this place; particularly 1 resolv-
ed to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all
my lpare arms, viz, two fowling pieces, for I had
three in all; and three muskets, for of them I had
eight in all; so I kept at my (jastle only five, which
stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon^ on my.
outmost fence; and were ready also to take out
lipon any expedition. Upon this occasion of re-
moving my ammunition, I took occasion to open
the barrel of powder, which I took up out of the
sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the
water
water had penetrated about three or four inches
into the powder, on every fide, which caking and
growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel
in the shell; so that I had near sixty pounds of very
good powder in the centre of the cask, and this was an
agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carri-
ed all away thither: never keeping above two or
three pound of powder with me in my castle for feaiJ
of a surprize of any kind: I also carried thither all
the lead I had left for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient
giants, which are said to live in caves, and holes,
in the rocks, where none could come at them: for
I persuaded myself while I was here, if five hun-
dred savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out; or if they did they would not
venture to attack me here. The old goat whom I
found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave, the
next day after I made this discovery: and I found
it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw
him in, and cover him with earth, than to drag
him out; so I interred him there to prevent the
offence to my nose,
I was now in the twenty-third year of my resi-
dence in this island, and was so naturalized to the
place and the manner of living, that could I have
but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would
come
come to the place to disturb me, I could have been
content to have capitulated for Ijpending the rcA
of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had
laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I
had also arrived, to some little diversions and amuse-
ments, which made the time pass more pleasantly
with me a great deal than it did before; as first, I
had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak,
and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articu-
lately and plain that it was very pleasant to me, for
I believe no bird ever spoke plainer, and he lived
with me no less than six and twenty years; how
long he might live in all I knew not, though I
know they have a notion in the Brasils that they
live an hundred years. My old dog was a very
pleasant and loving companion to me for no Ids
than sixteen years of my time, and then died of
mere old age. As ,for my cats they multiplied, as
I have observed, to that degree that I was obliged
. to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from
devouring me, and all I had; but at length when
the two old ones X brought with me were gone,
and after some time continually driving them from
me, and letting them have no provision with me,
they all ran wild into the woods, except two or
three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose
- young when they had any I always drowned, and,
these were part of my family: besides these, I always
kept tv/o or three hcuftold kids about me, whom
I taught
\ 
% I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had twos
more parrots which talked pretty well, and would
all call Robin Crusoe, but none like my first; nor
indeed did I take the pains with any of them that
1 had done with him. I had also several tame sea-
fowl, whose names I know not, that I caught
upon the shore, and cut [their wings; and the
little stakes which I had planted before my castle
Vail, being now grown up to a good thick grove,
these fowls all lived among these low trees, and
bred there> which was very agreeable to me; so
that, as I said above I began to be very well con-
tented with the life I ted, if I might but have been
secured from the dread of the savages. But it was
otherwise directed; and may not be amiss for all
people who shall meet v/ith my story, to make this
just observation from it, viz. u How frequently
in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself
we seek most to shun, and which, when we are
fallen into it is the most dreadful to us, is often-
times the very means or door of deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised from the afflic-
tion we are fallen into." I could give many
examples of this in the course of my unaccountable
life; but in nothing was it more particularly re-
markable, Chan in the circumstances of my last
years of solitary residence in this island. It was
now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this being the southern-solstices
2 for
Winter I cannot call it, was the particular time of
my harvest* and required my being pretty much
abroad in the fields, when going out pretty early in
the morning, even before it was thorough day-light*
I was surprized with seeing a light of some fire
upon the shore* at a distance from me, of about
two miles, towards the end of the island, where I
had observed some savages had been as before, but
not on the other side; and to my great affliction, it
was on my side of the island*
I was indeed terribly surprized at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go
out, lest I might be surprized; and yet I had no
more peace within from the apprehensions I had,
that if these savages in rambling over the island
should find, my corn standing or cut, or any of
my works and improvements, they would imme-
diately conclude, that there were people in the
place* and would then never give over till they
had found me out: in this extremity I went back
directly to my castle* pulled up the ladder after
me, and made all things without look as wild and
hatural as I could;
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself
in a posture of defence; I loaded all my cannon, as
I called them: that is to fay, my muskets which
ware mounted upon my new fortification, and all my
U pistols,
ADVENTURES OP
pistols, and resoved to defend myself to the fast
gasp> not forgeting seriously to commend myself
to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God
t6 deliver m6 out of the h&nds of the barbarians:
and in this posture I continued about two hours -
but began to be mighty impatient for intelligence
abroad, for I had no spies to fend out. After
fitting a while longer and musing what I should do
in this cafe, I was not able to bear sitting in ignor-
ance any longer, so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I
observed before, and th£n pulling the ladder up
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top
of the hill; and pulling out my perspective glass>
Which I had taken oil purpose, I laid me down
flat on my belly, On the ground, and began to
look for the place. I presently found there were
no less than nine naked savages, sitting round a
small fire they had made, hot to warm them, sot
they had no need of that, the weather being extreme
hot; but as I supposed to dress some of their bar-
barous diet of human flesh, which they had brought
With them, whether alive or dead I could not tell.
_ They had two canoes with them, which they
had hauled up upon the shore; and as it was ther*
tide of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the*
return of the flood, to go away again; it is not
easiy to imagine what confusion this sight put me
into, especially seeing them come on my side the
island, and so near me too; but when I observed
their coming must be always with the current of*
the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in
my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad
with safety all the time of the tide of flood, if they
were not on stiore before: and having made this
observation, I went abroad about my harvest work
with the more composure*
As I expected, so it proved for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take
boat and row (or paddle as we call it) all away;
I should have observed, that for an hour or more
before they went off} they went a dancing, and I
could easily discern their postures, and gestures>
by my glass: I could not perceive by my nicest
observation, but that they were stark naked, and
had not the least covering upon them; but whether
they were men or women, that I could not distin-
guish*
As soon as 1 saw them shipped, and gone, I
took two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols
at my girdle, and my great swbrd by my side,
without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was
able to make; I went away to the hitl where I had
discovered the first appearance of all; and as soon
as I got thither, which was not in ld\ than two
U 2 hours 3
\
hours; for I could not go apace, being so loader*
with arms as I was. I perceived there had been
three canoes more of savages at that place; and
looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea
together, making over for the main. This was
a dreadful fight to me, especially when going down
to the shore, I could see the marks of horror, which
the dismal work they had been about had left be-
hind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the
flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those
wretches, with merriment and sport: I was so filled
with indignation at the sight, that I now began to
premeditate the destruction of the next I saw there,
let them be whom or how many soever. It seemed
evident to me, that the visits which they made
thus to this island, are not very frequent; for it was
above-fifteen months, before any more of them
came on ftore there again; that is to fay, I neither
saw them, or any footsteps, or signals of them, in
all that time; for as to the rainy seasons, then
they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so
far, yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by
reason of the constant apprehensions I was in of
their coming upon me by surprize; from whence I
observe, that the expectation of evil, is more bitter
than the suffering, especially if there is no room to
shake off that expectation, or those apprehen-
sions.
During
. During all this time I was in the murthering
humour; and took up most of my hours, which
should have been better employed, in contriving
how to circumvent, and fall upon them, the very
next time I should see them; especially if they
should be divided, as they were the last time, into
two parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I
killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was still
thenextday,orweek, or month to kill another, and so
another, even ad infinitum, till I should be at length
no less a murtherer, than they were in being man-
eaters; and perhaps much more so. I spent my days
now in great perplexity, and anxiety of mind, ex-
pecting that I should one day or other fall into the
hands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at
any time venture abroad, it was not without look-
ing round me with the greatest care and caution
imaginable: and now I found to my great com-
fort, how happy it was, that I provided for a tame
flock or herd of goats; for I durst not upon any
account fire my gun, especially near that side of the
island where they usually came, lest I should alarm
the savages, and if they had fled from me now I
was sure to have them come again; with perhaps
two or three hundred canoes, with them, in a few
days, and then I knew what to expect. However,
1 wore out a year and three months more, before I
ever saw anymore of the savages, and then I found
them again j as I shall soon observe. It is true,
U 3 they
\
ADVENTURES OF
they might have been there once, or twice; but either
they made no stay, or at least I did not hear them;
but in the month of May, as near as I could cal-
culate, and in my four and twentieth year, I had a
very strange encounter with them, of which in its
place. The perturbation of my mind, during this
fifteen or sixteen months interval, was very great;
I slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams,
and often started out of my sleep in the night: in
the day,.great troubles overwhelmed my mind5
and in the night I dreamed often of killing the
savages, and of the reasons why I might justify the
doing of it j but to wave all this for a while; it
was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day I
think, as well as my poor wooden calendar woul4
reckon; for I marked all upon the post still; I
fay, it was the sixteenth of May, that it blew a,
very great storm of wind all day, with a great
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul,
night it was after it; I know not what was the
particular occasion pf.it; but as I w^s reading \x\
the bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts,
about my present condition, I was surprized with
the noise of a gun, as I thought fired at lea,
This was to be lure a surprize, of a quite dis,
ferent nature from any I had met with before; for
the notions this put into my thoughts, were quite
of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste
imaginably
imaginable, and in a trice clapt my ladder to the
middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me, and mounting it the second time, got to the
top of the hill, (the very moment) that a flash of
fire bid me listen for another gun, which according-
ly, in about half a minute I heard; and by the
sounds knew that it was from that part of the sea,
were I was driven down the current in my boat*
I immediately considered, that this must be
some ship in distress, and that they, had somQ
comrade, or some other ship in company, an4
fired these guns, for signals of distress, and to
obtain help; I had this presence of mind at that
minute, as to think that though I could not help
them, it might be they, might help me; so I
brought together aU the dry wood I could get at
hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it;
on fire upon the hill $ the wood was dry and blazed
freely, and though the wind blew very hard, yet it
burnt fairly out $ that I was certain, if there was
my such thi#g a§ a ship they must needs fee it and
no doubt they did j for as soon as ever my fire
blazed up, I heard another gun, and after tha£
several others, ^11 from the fame quarter y I plyed
my fire aU night long, till day broke; and wh,ei}
it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw
something at a great distance at sea, full east of the
island, whether a iail or a huU> I coyld not distin-
U 4 guist*
\
guisli, no not with my glass, the distance was' sq
great, and the weather still something h&zy also *
at least it was so out at sea,
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently
concluded that it was a fliip at anchor, and being
eager you may be lure, to be satisfied, I took my
gun in my hand, and ran towards the south side of
the island, to the rocks where I had formerly been
carried away with the current, and getting up there,
the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I
could plainly fee to my great sorrow, the wreck
of a ship cast away in the night, upon those con-
cealed rocks which I found, when 1 was out in
my boat5 and which rocks, as it checked th^
violence of the stream, and made a kind of a count
ter stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my re-
covering from the most desperate hopeless condition
that ever I had been in all my life. Thus what was
one man's safety, is another man's destruction;
for it seems these men, whoever they were, being
out of their knowledge, and the rocks being
wholly under water, had driven upon them in
the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E
N. E. Had they seen the island, as 1 must ne-
cessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endeavoured to have laved them-
selves on shore by the help of their boat 5 but their
firing
firing of guns for help, especially when they saw,
&s I imagined, my fire, filled me with many
thoughts; First, I imagined, that upon feeing my
light, they might have put themselves into their
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore:
but that the sea going very high, they might have
been cast away; other times I imagined, that they
might have lost their boat before, as might be the
cafe, many ways as particularly by the breaking
of the sea upon their flup which many times obliges
men to stave, or take in pieces their boat, and
sometimes to throw it overboard with their own
hands: other times I imagined they had some other
ship, or sliips in company, who upon the signals
of distress they had made, had taken them up,
and carried them off: other whiles I fanci-
ed they where all gone off to sea in their boat,
and being hurried away by the current that I
had been formerly in, were carried out into the
great ocean, where there was nothing but misery
and perishing, and that perhaps they might by this
time think of starving, and of being in a condition
to eat one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best; so in
the condition I was in, I could do no more than
look upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them, which had still this good effect on my side,
ihzt it gave me more and more cause to give thanks
to
\
to God who had so happily and comfortably provid-
ed for me in my desolate condition; and that of two
ships companies who were now cast away upon this
part of the world, not one life stiould be spared but
mine: I learned here again to observe, that it is
very rare that the providence of God casts us into
any condition of life so low, or any misery so great,
but we may see something or other to be thankful
Cor; and may see others in worse circumstances
than our own.
Such certainly was the cafe of these men, of
whom I could not so much as fee room to luppose
any of them were laved $ nothing could rcjake it
rational, so much as to wisti, or expect that they
did not all periih there ; except the possibility only
of their being taken up by another ship in company*
and this was but mere possibility indeed; for I saw
jiot the least appearance of any such thing. I can-
not explain by any possible energy of wordiv what
3 strange longing or hankering of desires I felt
in my foul upon this fight -} breaking out Jome-
times thus jc O that there had been but one or two $
nay, or but one soul saved out of this sliip, to have
escaped to me, that I might have but one com-
panion, one fellow creature to have spoken to me,
and to have conversed with:' In all the time of my
solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a
desire
desire after the society of my fellow creatures, or so
deep a regret at the want of it.
There are some secret moving springs in the
affections, which when they are set a going by
some object, or be it some object, though not in
view, yet rendered present to the mind by the pow-
er of imagination, that motion carries out the foul
by its impetuosity to such yiolent eager embracings
of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
Such were these earnest wisliings, that but one man
had been saved!c* O that it had been but one!" I
believe I repeated the words,€ O that it had been but
one/ a thousand times; and my desires were so
moved by it^ that when I spoke the words, my hands
would clinch together, and my fingers press the
palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft thing
in my hand, it would have crufht it involuntarily;
and my teeth in my head would strike together,
and let against one auother so strong that for some
time I could not part them again. Let the
naturalists explain these things, and the reason and
manner of them; all I can say to them, is, to des-
cribe the fact, which was even surprizing to me,
when I found it, though I knew not from what it
should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of ardent
wishes and of strong ideas formed in the mind,,
realizing the comfort, which the conversation of
ojxe of my fellow christians would have been to me.
But
\
But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or
or both forbad it 5 for till the last year of my being
on this island I never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship or no, and had only the affliction
some days after to fee the corps of a drowned boy
come on stiore at the end of the island which was
next the sliip-wreck; he had on no cloaths but a
seaman's waist-coat, a pair of open kneed linen
drawers, and a blue linen shirt, but nothing to di-
rect me so much as to guess what nation he was of;
he had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of
eight and a tobacco pipe; the last was to me of ten
times more value that the first. It was now calm,
and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat
to this wreck, not doubting but I might find
something on board that might be useful to me5
but that did not altogether press me so much as the
possibility that there might be yet some living crea-
ture on board, whose life I might not only save,
but might by saving that life comfort my own to
the last degree; and this thought clung so close to
my heart that I could not be quiet night or day, but
I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck;
and committing the rest to God's providence, I
thought the impression was so strong upon my mind
that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
some invisible direction, and that I should be want-
ing; to myself if I did not o, -
Under the power of this impression I hastened back-
to my castle, prepared every thing for my voyage,
took a quantity of bread, a great pot for frestt
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum, for
I had still a great deal of that left, a basket full of
raisins: £.nd thus loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water
out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo
in her, and then went home again for more: My
second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the um-
brella to set up over my head for a sliade, another
large pot of fresh water, and about a dozen of my
small loaves or barley cakes more than before, with
a bottle of goats milk and a cheese, all which with
great labour and sweat I brought to my boat, and
praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out, and
rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, I
came at last to the utmost point of the island on
that fide, viz. N. E. And now I was to launch
out into the ocean, and either to venture, or not to
venture, I looked on the rapid currents which ran
constantly on both sides of the island at a distance,
and which were- very terrible to me, from the
rememberance of the hazard I had been in before,
and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw, that
if I was driven into either of those curents I sliould
be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out
of my reach or sight of the island again j and that then
1 as
\
$02 % A £) V E N T IT R £ 5 Of
as my boat was but small, if any little gale of* wind
Ihould rise I stiould be inevitably lost*
These thoughts so oppressed my mind> that I
began to give over my enterprizej and having
hauled my boat ihto a little creek on the, shore, I
stepped out, and sat me down upon a little rising
bit of ground, very pensive and anxious between
fear and desire about my voyage \ when as I was
musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned
and the flood come on, upon which my going was
for so many hours impracticable \ upon this pre-
sently it occurred to me3 that 1 should go up
to the highest piece of ground I could find, and
observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or
currents lay when the flood came in^ that I might
judge whether if I was driven one way out, I might
jiot expect to be driven another way home with the
fame rapidnefs of the currents: This thought was
no sooner in my head but I cast my eye upon a little
hill which sufficiently over-looked the sea both
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the
currents or sets of the tide, and which way I was
to guide myself in my return; here I found, thaC
as the current of the ebb set out close by the, south
point of the island, so the current of the flood set
in close by the shore of the north side, and that I
h&d nothing to do but to keep to the north of the
islSnd in my return, and I should do well enough.

'Robinson ceusol 303
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning to set out with the first of the1 tide;
and reposing myself for the night in the canoe, und£r
the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out:
I made first a little out to sea full north, till I began
to feel the benefit of tfte current which set eastward,
and whfch carried me at a great rate, and yet did not
so hurry me as the southern side current had done
before, and so as to take from me all government
of the boat: but having a strong steerage with
my paddle*. I went at a great rate directly for the
wreck, and in less than two hours I came \ip to
it. It was a dismal sight to look at; the ship,
which by its building was Spanish, stuck fast,
jam'd in between two rocks; all the stern and
'quarter of her were beaten to pieces with the
sea; and as her forecastle which stuck in the
rocks, had run on with great violence, her main-
mast and foremast were brought by the board,
that is to fay, broken short ofr, but her bowlprit
was found, and the head and bow appeared firm;
when I came close to her a dog appeared upon
her, who seeing me cpming yelped and ciyed,
and as soon as I called 'him, jumped into the sea
to come to me, and I took him into, the boat,
but sound him almost dead with hunger and
thirst; I gave hifn a cake of my bread, and he
did eat it like a ravenous wolf that had been
starving a fortnight in the siiow; and then gave
the
304 A d v e n t ti n S O?
the poor creature some fresli water, with whicfi*
if I would have let him, he would halve burst
himself- After this I went on board, but the?
first sight I met with was two men drowned irt
the cook room, or forecastle of the ship, with their
arms fast about one another;- I concluded, as is
indeed probable, that when the ship struck* it Ber-
ing in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so
continually over her, that the men were not able
to bear it; and. were suffocated with the constant
rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been
under water.Besides the dog, there Was nothing left in
the ship that had life* nor any goods that I could see
but what were spoiled by the waters there were some
casks of liquors whether wifte or brandy I knew
not, which lay lower in the hold, and which the
water being ebbed out I could fee, but they were
too big to meddle with 1 saw several Chests
which I believe belonged to some of the seamen,
and I got two of them, into the boat, without
examining what was in them, Had the stern of
the sliip been fixed and the forepart broken off,
I am persuaded I might have made a good
voyage: for by what I found in these two chests
I had room to suppose the sliip had a great deal
of wealth on board; and if I may guess by the;
course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayres or the Rio de la Plata, in the*
-south part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the
Havanna?
"Savanna, in theGulph of Mexico, and so perhap$
to Spain: flie had no doubt a great treasure in
her> but of no use at that time to any body; and
what became of the rest of her people I then knew
not.
I found besides these chests a little calk full
of liquor, of about twenty gallons which I got
into my boat, with much difficulty; there were
several muskets in a cabin, and a great powder
horn, with about four pounds of powder in it;
as for the muskets I had no occasion for them, so I
left them, but took the powder horn: I took a
fire shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely*
as also two little brals kettles, a copper pot to
make chocolate, and a gridiron j and with this
cargo and the dog I came away, the tide begin-
ning to make home again •> and the fame evening
about an hour within night, I reached the island
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I
reposed that night in the boat, and in die morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in
my new cave, not to carry it home to my castle.
After refreshing myself I got all my cargo on
ihore, and began to examine the particulars: the
calk of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but
not such as we had at the Brasils, and in a word
not at all good; but when I came to open the
chests I found several things of great use to me;

ADVENTURES OF
for example, I found in one a fine case of bof-*
ties, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with
Cordial waters fine and very good, the bottles held
about three pints each, and were tipped with
silver; I found two pots of very good fuccades
or sweatmeats, so fastened also on the top, that
the salt water had not hurt them, and two more
of the same which the water had spoiled; I found
some very good shirts, which were very welcome
to me; and about a dozen and a half of white
linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the
former were also very welcome, being exceeding
refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day; besides
this, when I came to the till in the chest I found
there three great bags of pieces of eight, which
held about eleven hundred pieces in all, and in
one of them, wrapt up in a paper, fix doubloons
of gold and some small bars or wedges of gold,
I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some cloaths in
it, but of little value; but by the circumstances
it must have belonged to the gunner's mate though
there was no powder in it, but about two pounds
of fine glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept
I suppose, for charging their fowling pieces on
occasion: upon the whole, I got very little by
this voyage that was of any use to me; for as to
the money, I had no manner of occasion for it: it
was

Would have given it all for three or four pair of
English shoes and stockings which were things I
greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet for
many years: I had indeed gotten two pair of
shoes now, which I took'off of the feet of the
two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck:
and I found two pair more in one of the chests
which were very welcome to me -9 but they were
not like our Englisli shoes* either for ease or ser-
vice, being rather what we call pumps than shoes
I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces
of eight ih rials, but no gold, I suppose this
belonged to- a poorer man than the other, which
seemed to belong to some officer. Well> however
1 lugged this money home to my cave, and laid
it up as I had done that before^ which I brought
from our own ship; but it was great, pity as I
said, that the other part of this ship had not
come to my share, for I am satisfied I might
have loaded my canoe several times over with
money, and* thought I, if I ever escape to Eng-^
land, it might lie here safe enough till I may
come again and fetch iu
Having now brought all my things oh fliore
and secured them, I went back to my boat} and
rowed or paddled her along the sliore to her old
harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best
X 2 of
\
of my way to my old habitation, where J. soufid
every thing safe and quiet; so I began to repose
myself, live after my old fastiion, and take care of
my family affairs; and for a while I lived easy
enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used
to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad
so much: and if at any time I did stir with any
freedom, it was always to the east part of the
island, where I was pretty well satisfy'd the sa-
vages never came, and where I could go without
so many precautions, and such a load of arms
and ammunition, as I always carried with me,
if I went the other way. I lived in this con-
dition near two years more; but my unlucky
head, that was always to let me know it was
born to make my body miserable, was all these
two years filled with projects and designs, how,
if it were possible, I might get away from this
island; for sometimes I was for making another
voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me
that there was nothing left there worth the hazard
of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way,
sometimes another j and I believe verily, if I had
had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should
have ventured to sea bound any where, I knew
not whither. I have been in all my circumstances
a memento to those who are touched with the
general plague of mankind, whence, for ought I
know, one half of their miseries flow, I mean that
of
of not being satisfied with the station wherein God
and nature has placed them; for not to look
back upon my primitive condition, and the ex-
cellent advice of my father, the opposition to
which was, as I may call it, my Original Sin,
my subsequent mistakes of the fame kind had been
the means of my coming into this miserable con-
dition; for had that providence which so happily
had seated me at the Brasils as a planter, blessed
me with confined desires, and I could have been
contented to have gone on gradually, I might
have been by this time, I mean in the time
f>{ my being in this island, one of the most
considerable planters in the Brasils; nay, I am
persuaded that by the improvements I had made
in that little time I lived there, and the increase
I should probably have-made if I had stayed, I
anight haye been worth an hundred thousand
cnoidores: and what business I had to leave a
fettled fortune, a well stocked plantation improv-
ing and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea,
to fetch negroes, ^hen patience and time would
have so increased our stock at home, that we
could have bought them at our own door fi^om
those whose business it was to fetch them 5 and
though it had cost us something more, yet the
difference of that price was by no means wprth
saving at so great a hazard, But as, this is or-
dinarily the fate of young heads, so reflection upon
X 3 the
\
the folly of it is as ordinarily the exercise of
more years, or of the dear-bought experience of
time; and so it was with me now; and yet fa
deep had the mistake taken root in my temper,
that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but
was continually poring upon the means and
possibility of my escape from this place; and that
I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader,
bring on the remaining part of my storjv it may
not be improper to give some account of my
first conceptions on the subject of this foolisli
scheme for my escape, and how and upon what
foundation I acted, I am now tq be supposed,
retired into my castle after my late voyage to the
wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water,
as usual, and my condition restored to what it
was before -y I had more wealth indeed than I had
before, but was not at all the richer, for I had
no more use for it than the Indians of Peru had
before the Spaniards came there.
It was one of the nights in the rainy season
March, the four and twentieth year of my first
setting f°ot *n ^is island of solitariness, I was
lying h.1 my bed or hammock awake, very well
in health, ^ad n0 Pa*n* no distemper, no uneasi-
ness of body ^ no> nor any uneasiness of mind more
than ordinary, but could hY no means close my
'eyes
eyes, that is so as to sleep, no not a wink aiji
night long, otherwise than as follows;
It is as impossible as needless, to set down the
innumerable croud of thoughts that whirled through
that great thorough-fare of the brain the memory,
1 in this night's time; I run over the whole history of
my life in miniature, or by abridgment, .as I may
call it, to my coming to this iflajnd, and also of
the part of my life since I came to this island.
In my reactions upon the state of my cafe
since I canas P*1 shore on this islands I was com-
paring the happy posture of my affairs in the first
year of my habitation here, compared to the life
of anxiety, fear and care in which I Jaad lived
ever since I had leen the print of ai foot in the
sand; not that I did not believe the savages had
frequented the island even all the while, and slight
have been several hundreds of them &t times on
shore there -y but I had never known it, an4 was ir-
capable of any apprehensions about it $ my satisfac-
tion was perfect, though my danger, was the fame,
and I was a§ happy in not knowing my danger,
as if I had never really been exposed to it: this
furnistied my thoughts with many very profit-
able reflections, and particularly this one, "How
infinitely good that providence is, which has pro-
vided in its government of mankind such narrow
bounds to his sight and knowledge 9s things j
\
4 and
and though he walks in -the midst of so many
thousand dangers, the fight of which, if disco-
vered to him, would distract his mind and sink
his spirits, he is kept serene and calm by having
the events of things hid from his eyes, and know-
thing nothing of the dangers which surround him/*
After these thoughts had for some time enter-
tained me, I came to reflect, seriously upon the
real danger I had been in for so many years in
this very island, and how I had walked about iq.
the greatest security, and with all possible tran-
quillity, even when perhaps nothing but a brow
of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of
night, had been between me and the worst kind
of destruction^ viz, that qf falling into the hands
of cannibals and savages who would have seized
on me with the same view as I would on a goat
or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime
to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon
or curlieu: I would unjustly slander myself, if I
should say I was not sincerely thankful to my
great preserver, to whose singular protection I
acknowledged, with great humility, that all these
unknown deliverances were due, and without
which I must inevitably have fallen into their mer-
ciless hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was
for some time taken up in considering the nature
of
of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages,
and how it came to pass in the world, that the
wife governor of all things should give up any
of his creatures to such inhumanity, nay to some-
thing so much below even brutality itself, as to
devour its own kind \ but as this ended in some
(at that time fruitless) speculations, it occured to
me to enquire what part of the world these
wretches lived in? how far off the coast was from
whence they came? what they ventured over so
far from home for? what kind of boats they had?
and why I might not order myself and my busi-
ness so, that I might be as able to go over thither
as they were to come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to con-
sider what I should do with myself when I came
thither; what would become of me if I fell into
the hands of the savages $ or how I should escape
from them if they attemped me -y no, nor so much
as how it was possible for me to reach the coast,
and not be attempted by some or other of them,
without any possibility of. delivering myself; and
if I should not fall into their hands, what I should
do for provision, or whether I slrculd bend my course:
none of these' thoughts, I lay, so much as came
in my way, but my mind was wholly bent \jpon
the notion of my passing ever in my boat to the
main
\
main land. I looked back upon my present
condition as the most miserable that could pos-
sibly be, that I was not able to throw myself
into any thing but death, that could be called
worse: that if I reached the shore of the main
I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast
along, as I did on the Ihore of Africk, till I came
to some inhabited country, and where I might
find some relief; and after all,, perhaps, I might
fall in with some christian ship that might take
me in; and if the worst came to the worst, I
could but die, which would put an end to all
these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was
the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient tem-
per, made as it were desperate by the long con-
tinuance of my troubles, and the disappointments
I had met in the wreck I had been cm board of,
and where I had been so near the obtaining what
I so earnestal longed for, viz, somebody to speak
to, and to learn some knowledge from them of the
place where I was, and of the probable means of
my deliverance: I fay I was agitated wholly by
these thoughts: all my calm of mind in my re-
signation to providence, and waiting the issue of
the dispositions of heaven, seemed to be suspend-
ed and I had, as it were, no power to turn my
thoughts to any thing but to the project of a
voyage to the main^ which came upon me with
such
such a force, and such an impetuosity of desire
that it was not to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts for two
hours or more, with such violence that it set my
very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat
3S if I had been in a fever, merely with the
extrordinary fervour of my mind about it: nature
as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
very thought of it threw me into a found steep;
one would have thought I should have dreamed
of it, but I did not nor of any thing relating to
it; but I dreamed, that as I was going out in
the morning, as usual from my castle, I saw up-
no the shore two canoes and eleven savages com-
ing to land, and that they brought with them
another savage, whom they were going to kill,
in order to eat him, when on a sudden the savage
that they were going to kill jumped away and
ran for his life -y and I thought, in my sleep,
that he came running into my little thick grove,
before my fortification, to hide himself, and that
I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the
others sought him that way, shewed myself to
him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him;
that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me
to assist him 3 upon which I sliewed him my lad-
der, made him go up, and carried him into my
cave, and he became my servant and that as
soon
\  •
soon as I had gotten this man I said to myself
now I may certainly, venture to the main land,
for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will
tell me what to do, and whither to • go for provi-
sions, and whither not to go for fear of being
devoured; what places to venture into, and what
to shun; I waked with this thought, and was
under such inexpressible impressions of joy, at the
prospect: of my escape in my dream, that the
disappointments which I felt upon coming to
myself, and finding, it was no more than a dream,
were equally extravagant the other way, and threw
me into a very great dejection of spirit. Upon
this, however, I made this conclusion, that my
only way to go about to attempt #n escape,
was if possible, to get a savage into my posses-
sion, and if possible it should be one of their
prisoners whom they had condemned to be.eaten^
and should bring hither to kill $ but these thoughts
still were attended with this difficulty, that it was
impossible to effect this without attacking a whole
caravan of them, and killing them all j and this
was not only a very desperate attempt, and might
miscarry, but on the other hand, I had greatly
scrupled the lawfulness of ,it to myself > and my
heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so
much blood, though it was for my deliverance.
I need not repeat the arguments which occured
to me against this, they being the fame men-
tioned,
tioned before; but though I had other reasons
to offer now, viz. that those men were enemies
to my life, and would devour me if they could;
that it was self-preservation to the highest de-
gree to deliver myself from this death of a life,
and was acting in my own defence, as much as
as if they were actually assaulting me, and the
like. I lay, though these things argued for it,
yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for
my deliverance, were very terrible to me, and
such as I could by no means reconcile^ myself to
fora great while. However at last, after .many
secret disputes with myself, and after great per-
plexities about it, for all these arguments one
way with another struggled in my head a long
time, and the eager prevailing desire of deliver-
ance, at length mastered all the rest, and I re-
solved if possible, to get one of those savages into
my hands, cost what it would. My next thing
was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed
was very difficult to resolve on: but as I could
pitch upon no probable means for it, so I re-
solved to put myself upon the watch, to see them
when they came on shore, and leave the rest to
the event, taking such measures as the oppor-
tunity should present, let be what would be.
With these resolutions in my thoughts I set my-
self upon the scout as often as possible, and in-
deed so* often untill I was heartily tired of it, for
it
\
it was above a year and half that I waited*
and for great part of that time went out to the
west end, and to the south-west corner of the
island, almost every day, to see for canoes, but
none appeared. This was very discouraging, and
began to trouble me much, though I cannot say
that it did in this cafe as it had done some time
before that, viz. wear off the edge of my desire
to the thing. But the longer it seemed to be
delayed the more eager I was for it: in a word
I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of
of these savages, and avoid being seen by them*
as I was now eager to be upon them. Besides,
I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two
or three savages, if I had them so as to >make
them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I
stiould direct them, and to prevent their being able
at any time to do me any hurt, it was a great
while that I pleated myself with this affair, but
nothing still presented; all my fancies and schemes
came to nothing, for no savages came near me
for a great while. About a year and a half after
I entertained these notions, and by long musing
had as it were resolved them into nothing for
want of an occasion to put them in execution, I
was surprized one morning early, with seeing no
less than five canoes all on shore together on my
side the island, and the people who belonged to
them all landed, and out of my sight: the num-
ber
ber of them broke all my measures, for feeing so
many, and knowing that they always came four
or fix or sometimes more in a boat, I could not tell
what to think of it, or how to take my measures,
to attack twenty or thirty men single handed; so
lay still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted 5
however I put myself into all the same postures
for an attack that I had formerly provided, and
was just ready for action, if any thing had pre-
sented ;, having waited a good while listening to
hear if they made any noise: at length being very
impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder
and clambered up to/the top of the hill, by my
two stages as usual; standing so however that my
head did not appear above the hill, so that they
could not perceive me by any means; here I
observed by the help of my perspective glass, that
they were no less than thirty in number, that they
had a fire kindled, that they had had meat dress-
ed. .How. they had cooked it, that I knew? not,
or what it was; but they were all dancing in I
know not how many barbarous gestures and
figures, their own way, round the fire. While
I was. thus looking on them, I perceived by my
perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from
the boats, where it seems they were laid by, and
were now brought out for the slaughter. I per-
ceived one of them immediately fell, being knock-
ed down, I suppose, with a club or wooJen sword
for
\
for that was their way, and two or three others
were at work immediately cutting him open for
their cdokery, while the other victim was left
standing by himself, till they should be ready for
him. In that very moment, this poor wretch
seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound,
nature inspired him with hopes of life and he
started away from them, and ran with incredible
swiftness along the sands directly towards me, I
mean towards that part of the coast where my
habitation was. I was dreadfully frighted (that
I must acknowledge) when I perceived him to
run away, and especially, when as I thought, I
saw him pursued by the whole body* and now I
expected that part of my dream was coming to pass,
and that he would certainly take sticker in my
grove; but I could not depend by any means upon
my dream for the rest of it, viz» that the other
savages would not pursue him thither and find him
there. However I kept my station, and my
spirits began to recover when I found that there was
not above three men that followed him, and still
the more I was encouraged, when I found that he
out stripped them exceedingly in running, and
gained ground of them; so that if he could but hold
it for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get
away from them all.
The**.

There was between them and my castle the
creek, which I mentioned often in the first part
bf my story, when I landed my cargo; out of the
ship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily
lwim over, or the poor wretch would be taken
there j but whesi the savage escaping came thither,
he made nothing of it, though the tide was then
lip, but plunging in, swam through in about
thirty strokes* or thereabouts, landed., and ran on,
with exceeding strength and swiftness: when the
three persons came to the creek, I found that two
of them could swim, but the third could not, and
that standing on the other side, he looked at the
other, but went no farther, and soon after went
softly back again, which as it happened, was very
well for him in the main. I observed that the two
who swam Were yet more than twice as long
swimming over the creek, as the fellow was that
fled from them? it came now very warmly upon
my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now
was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a
companion or assistant, and that I was called plain-
ly by providence to save this poor creature's life;
I immediately ran down the ladders with all pos-
sible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they
were both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed
above, and getting up again, with the same haste,
to the top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea,
and having, a very short cut, and all down hill,
V clapped
\
clapped myself, in the way, between the pursuers
and ihe purfued3 hallooing aloud to him that
fledj who looking back, was at first perhaps, as
much frighted at me as at them; but I beckoned
with my hand to him to come back, and in the
mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two
that followed, then rushing at once upon the fore-
most, I knocked him down with the stock of my
piece; I was loth to fire, because I would not
have the-rest hear, though at that distance it would
not have been easily heard, and being out of sight
of the smoke too, they would not hare easily
known what to make of it: having knocked this
fellovf-down, the other who pursued him,1 stopped
as if he had been frighted, and I advanced a-pace
towards him; but as I came nearer,^ I perceived
presently he had a bow and arrow, -antl-was fitting
it to shoot at me, so I was then necessitated to
siioot at him first, which I did^ahd* killed him at
the first sliot; the poor savage who fled, £>ut had
stopped, though he law both his enemies fallen and
killed, as he thought, y<jt was so frrghted with the
1ire-and noise of my piece, that he stood stock still,
and neither came forward, or went 'backward,
though he seemed rather inclined to fly-still than:to
romeon; I hallooed again to him, and made signs
-to come forwards which' he easily understood, a*id
came a Itttle-wajr, then' stopped agaiii, and then a
little farther, and stopped again, and I^could then
perceive
perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had bee*
taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed^ as
his two enemies were; I beckoned to him again
to come to me, and gave him all the signs of en-
couragement that I could think of, and he came
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve
steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving
his Uses I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly,
and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at
length he came close to me, and then he kneeled
down again, kissed the ground and laid his head
upon the ground, and taking me by the foot set
my foot upon his head; this it seems was in token
of swearing to be my slave for ever; I took him
up, and made much of him, and encouraged him
by all I coulcj: but there was more work to do yet,
for I perceived the savage whom I knocked down
was not killed but stunned with the blow, and began
to come to himself; so I pointed to him, and
Ihewing him the savage, that he was not dead;
upon this he spoke some words to me, and though
I could not understand them> yet I thought they
were pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound
of a man's voice that I had heard, my own except-
ed, for above twenty five years. But there was
mo time for such reflections now, the savage who
was If nocked down recovered himself so far as to
sit, up upon^the ground, and I perceived that my
Xavage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I
Y a presented
\
presented my other piece at the man, as if I would
shoot him j upon this my savage, for so I call
him now, made a motion to me to lend him my
sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side,
fo I did; he no sooner had it but he luns to his
enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so clever-
ly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
sooner or better; which I thought very strange for
one, who I had reason to believe never saw a
sword in his life before, except their own wooden
swords; however, it seems, as I learned after-
wards, they make their wooden swords so stiarp,
so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will
cut off heads even with them, ay, and arms, and
that at one blow too: when he had done this, he
cofnes laughing to me, in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and with abundance
of gestures, Which I did not understand, laid it
down with the head of the savage that he had killed,
just before me. But that which astonished him
most was, to know how I had killed the other Indian
so far off; so pointing to him, he made signs to
me to let him go to him; so I bad him, go as
well as I could: when he came to him,The stood
like one amazed, looking'at him, turned him
first on one side, then on the bther, looked at tht
Wound the bullet had made, which it seems wa^
just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and
no great quantity of blood had followed, but he
had

ROJilNSON cfctfSOT,, 32$
i
had bled inwardly, so he was quite dead: he took
ijphis bow and arrows and'came back; so I turned
to go away, and beckoned to him to follow me,
making signs to him, that more might come after
them. Upon this he signed to me that he should
bury them with sand, that they might not be seen by
the rest, if they followed $ and so I made signs to
him again to do so; he' fell to work, and in an
ipstant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his
hands, big enough to bury the first in, and theji
dragged him into it, and covered him, and di4
so also by the other; I believe he had buried them
both in a quarter of an hour; then calling him
away, I carried him pot to my castle, but quite
away to my cave on the farther part of the island;
so I did not let my dream come to pass in that
part, viz. th^t he came into my grove for shelter.
Here I gave him bre%d and a bunch of raisin-s
to eat, and a draught of water, which I sound
he was indeed in great distress for by his running;
and having refreshed him, I made signs for him
to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place
where I had laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a
blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon my-
self sometimes; so tfye poor creature Jay down and
went to sleep,
\
Y 3 He
He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly
well made, with straight strong limbs, not toojlarge,
tall and well shaped, and, as I reckon, about
twenty six-years of age: he had a very good coun-
tenance,- not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemfcd
to have something very manly in his face, and yet
he had all the sweetness and softness of an Europe -
an in his countenance too, especially when he
smiled; his hair was long and black, not curled
like v/ool; his forehead very high and large, and a
great vivacity and sparkling Jharpness in his eyes;
the colour of his skin was not quite black, but very
tawny, and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous
tawny, as the Brasilians and Virginians and other
natives of America are, but of a bright kind of a
<lutt olive colour, tKat had in it sofnething very
agreeable, though not very easy to describe; his
face was round and plump, his nose small, not
flat like the negroes, a veiy good mouth, thin lips,
•and his fine teeth well set, and as*white ivory 1
After he had slumbered, rather dian slept,
about half an hour, he waked again, and comes
out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my
goats, which I had in the enclosure just by: when
-be espied me he came running to me, laying
himself down again upon the ground, with all the
possible signs of an humble thankful disposition,
'makeirfg a great many antic gestures to shew it; at
last
3*7
last he lays his head flat upon the ground, close to
my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as
he had done before, and after this made all the
signs to me of subjection, servitude and submission
imaginable, to let me know how he would serve
me so long as he lived; I understood him in many
things, and let him know I was very well pleased
with him; in a little time I began to speak to him,
and teach him to speak to me; and first I made
him know his name should be Friday, whicli was
the day I saved his life; I called him so for the me-
mory os the time; I likewise taught him to say
Master, and then let him know that was to be my
ftame; I likewise taught him to say yes and no,
and to, know the meaning of them; 1 gave him
some milk in ^n earthen pot, and let him fee me
drink it before him, and fop my bread in it,- and
gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he
quickly complied with, and maLde signs that it was
veiy good for him. I kppt there with him all that
night, but as soon as it was day, I beckoned to
him to come with me, and let him know I would
geve him some cloths, at which he seemed very
glad, for he w^s stark naked; As we went by the
place where he had buried the two men, he pointed
exactly to the place, and shewed me the marks that
he had made to find them again, making signs to
me that we stiould-dig them x^p again, $nd-eat
them: At this I appearedx very angry, exprefled
Y 4
my
my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit: as
at die thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand
to him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great submission: I then led him up; to the
top ,of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone,
and pulling out my glass, I looked and saw plainly
the place were they had been, but no appearance
of them or their canoes, so that it was plain they
were gone, and had left their two comrades behind
them without any search after them. But I was
not content with this discovery, but having now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I
takes my man Friday with me, giving him the
sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his
back, which I found he could use very dextrously,
making him carry one gun for me, and I two for
myself, and away. we marched to the place where
these creatures had been, for I had a mind now to
get some fuller intelligence of them: When I
fame to the place, my very blood ran chill in my
veinsj and my heart funk within me, at the horror
of the, spectacle 3 indeed it w&s a dreadful sight, at
least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing
of it; The place was covered with human bones,
the ground dyed with their blood, and great pieces
of flesh left here and there, half eaten, mangled
and scorched, and, in short, all the tokens of the
triumphant feast they had been making there,
after, a victory over their enemies y I saw three
"skulls,
/kulls, five hands, and the bones of three or sour
legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the
bodies^ and Friday by his, signs, made me under-
stand that they brought over four prisoners to feast
upon, that three of them were eaten up, and that
he, pointing to himself, was the fourth: that
there had been a great battle between them and
their next king? whose subjects, it seems he had
been one of, and that they had taken a great num-
ber of prisoners, all which were carried to several
places by those that had taken them in the fight,
in order to feast upon them, as was done here by
these wretches upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones,
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them to-
gether on a heap, and make a great fire upon it,
;and burn them all to aslies; I found Friday had
still a hankering stomack after some of the flesti,
and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I disco-
vered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of
it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst
not discover it: for I had by some means let him
know that I would kill him if he offered it.
When we had done this, we came back to our
icastle, and there I fell to work for my man Friday;
and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest, I
mentioned;
\ 
mentioned ^ and which I found in., the. ;wreckj and!
wJirch^ith a Jittle-,alteration,-fitfed him, very ^
then I made him 3. jerkin, of gQat's-sldn, ass well as

pleased to see himself almost, $s well eloathed as his
master;- itisitrue he vj^nt awkwardly in :tl\efe:things

him,: jand (the -steeyes of the. waistcpat galled* his
shoulders, and-the. irifide p£ his anias r but ^ lktk

;and juiing himself tp them, atlengtLhe topk t$
. them very well,
Tht-jiext day after I came home/rom^y hutch
vrith him, . I began to consider where ]l stiould
lodge,him; and that I might do well for him, and
yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a. little tent
for him in the vacant place,. between my. two for-
tifications, in the iniide of the last, and ir} the
outside of the. first; apd as there was a doqr or
entrance ,there into my, cave, I made a formal
framed door-case, and a door to, it of boards, and
set it up in the passage a little within the entrance;
%nd causing the door to open on the inside,- I barr-
ed \t.jup, in the flight, .taking : in my-ladders *tqq;
ib
to (hat Friday could no way come at me in the
inside of my innermost wall, without^aking so
much noise in getting over, that it must needs
wakfen me: for my first wall had now a compleat
rods over it, of long poles covering all my tent,
and leaning up to the side of the hills which was
again laid across with smaller sticks instead of laths,
and" then thatched over a great thickness with the
rice-straw, which was strong like reeds s and at the
hole or place which was left to go in or out by the
ladder,/1 had placed a kind of trap door, which
if it had been attempted on the outside, would not
have opened at all,' but WQpld have fallen down,
and made a great noise; and as to weapons I took
them all into my fide every night. But I needed
none of all this precaution > sot never man had a
more faithful, loving sincere servant than Friday
was to me; without passions, sullennefe or designs,
1 perfectly obliged and engaged -> his very affections
were tied to me, like those of a child to a father;
and I dare say, he would have sacrificed his life
for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever":
the many testimonies he gave me of this, put it
out of doubt, and soon convinced me, that I
needed to use no precautions, as to my safety on
his account.'
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that however, it had pleased £iod,
in
\;
in his providence, and in the . government of thfe
works of his hands* to take from so "great a part
of the world of his creatures, the best viles to
which their faculties, and thepowers of their fouls
are adapted j yet that he has bestowed upon them
the fame powers, the fame reason, the fame affec-
tions, the fame sentiments of kindness, ^nd obliga-
tion, the fame passions and resentments of wrongs,
the fame fense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and
all the capacities of, doing good, and receiving
good that he Jias given to us; and that when he
pleases to offer to them o ccasions of exerting these,
they are as ready, nay, more ready to apply them
so the right uses for which they were bestowed, than
we are; and this made me yery melancholy some-
times, in reflecting, as the several occasions pre-
sented, how mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have theft powers enlightened by the great
lamp of instruction, .the spirit of God, and by the
knowledge of his word, added to our understand-
ing; and why it has pleased God to hide the like
saving knowledge from so many millions of souls,
who if I might judge by this poor savage, would
pnake a much better ule of it than wt did.
From hence, I sometimes was led. too far, to
invade the sovereignty of providence, and as if
were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition^
of things, that should hide that light from some,
and
$
333
and reveal it to others* and yet expect: a like duty
from both; but I shut it up, and checked my
thoughts with this conclusion, (ist.) That v/e did
not know by what light and law, these should be
condemned; but that as God, was necessarily, and
by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and just,
so it could not be, but that' if these creatures were
all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on
account of sinning agdinft that light, which, as
the scripture says,'was a law to themselves, and by
such rules as their consciences would acknowledge
to be just, though the foundation was not disco-
vered totis: arid (2d.) that still as we all are the
clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel sliould
fay to him, why hast thou formed me thus.
But to teturn to my new companion; I was
gfeatly delighted with him, and made it my bu-
siness, to teach him every thing, that was proper
to make him 'useful, handy, and helpful; but
especially to make him speak, and understand me
when I spoke, and he was the aptest scholaf* that
ever was^ and particularly, was so merry, so con-
stantly diligent, and so pleased, when he could
but understand me, or make me understand him,
that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him i
and now my life began to be so easy, that I
began to say to myself that could I but have been
fase
safe from more tevages, I c^ed not, if I was never
to remove from the place where I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to
my; castle, I thought that in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the
relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him
taste other flelh: so I took him out with me one
morning to the woods: I went indeed intending
to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring
him home, and dress it. But as I was going, I
saw a stie goat lying down in the stiade, and two
young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Fri-
day^ hold, fays I, standstills and made signs to
him not to stir, immediately I presented my piece,
shot and killed one of the kids. The poor crea-
ture who had at a distance indeed seen me kill the
iavage his enemy, but did not know 6r could
imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprized,
trembled and sti ok, and looked so amazed, that
I thought he would have sunk down, He did not
see the kid I Ihot at, or perceived I had killed it,
but ripped up his waist-coat, to feel whether he
was not wounded, and as I found, presently
thought I was resolved to kill him; for he came
and kneeled down to me, and embraced my knees,
said a great many things I did not understand; but
I could easily fee the meaning was to pray me
not to kill him,
1 s6on
I soon found a way to convince him, that i
would do him no harm; and taking hifri up by the
hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid,
which I had killed,; beckoned to him to run and
fetch it, which he did;' and while he was wonder-
ing and looking to fee'how die creature was killed,
I loaded my gun again, and by and by, I saw a
great fowl like a hawk/ sitting upon a tree-within
shot; so to let Friday understand a little what I
would do, I called him to me again, pointed
at die fowl^ which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought It had been a hawk, I fay pointing to the
parrot, and to my gun, aud to the ground under
die parrot, to let him lee I would make it fall, I
made him understand that I would shoot and kill
that bird; accordingly s sired and bade him look,
and immediately feeing the parrot fall, he stood
like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had
said to him; and I found he was the more amazed,
because he did not see me put any thing into the
4 gun; but thought that there must be some wonderful
fund of death and destruction, in that thing, able
to kill man, beast, bird, or any riling near, or far
off; and the astonishment this created in him was
such, as could not wear off for a long time; and I
believe if I would have let him, he would have
.'worshipped me and my gun: as for the gun itself,
he would not so much as touch it for several days
ctfKr> but he would speak to it, and talk to it,; -as
if
if it had answered him, when he was by himself;
which as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire
it not to. kill him* Well, after his astonishment
was a little over at this, I pointed to him to runs
and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but
staid some time, for the pattot riot being quite
dead, was stuttered away a good distance from the
place where she fell; however, he found her, tdok
her up, and brought her to me$ and as I had per-
ceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took
this advantage to charge the gun again, and hot td
let him fee me do it, that I might be ready for any
other mark that might present; but nothing more
offered at that time; so I brought home the kid>
and the same evening I took the sldn off, and cut
it out as well as I could, and having a pot fit for
that purpose, I boiled dr stewed some of the flefli;
and made some very good broth; and after I had
begun to eat some* I gave some to my man, who
seemed vefy glad of it^ and liked it very well ^
but that which was strangest to him* was to fee*
me eat salt with it; he made a sign to me that the
salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into
his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and
would lpit and sputter at it ,< washing his mouth
with fresh water after it; on the other hand, I tdok
some meat into my mouth without salt,1 and I pre^
tended to Ipit and sputter for want of salt, as fast
as he .had done at the salt, but it would not do?
he
he would never care for fair, with his meat or in
his broth, at least not for a great while, and then
but a very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and
broth, I was resolved to feast him the next day
with roasting a piece of the kid,* this I did by
hanging it before the fire on a string, as I had
seen many people do in England, setting two poles
up, one on each side the fire, and one cross on
the top, and tying the string to the cross stick,
letting the meat turn continually 2 This Friday
admired very much, but when he came to taste
the fiesti* he took so many ways to tell me how
well he liked it, that I could not but understand
him, and at last he told, me^ as well as he could*
he would never eat man's flesli any more> which
1 was very glad to hear.
The fiext day 1 set him to work to beating
some corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used
to do, as I. observed before, and he soon under-
stood how to do it.as well as I, especially after he
had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it
was to make bread of it; for after that I let him fee
me make my bread, and bake it too, and in a little
time Friday was able to do all the work for me, as
well as I could do it myself.
Z I BE*.
\
I b'egan now to consider, that having- twa
mouths to feed instead of one, I must provide
, more ground for liny havest, and plant a larger
quantity of corn than I used to do; sol marked
out a larger piece of landy and began the fence in
the fame manner as before, in which Friday worked
not only very willingly and very hard, but did it
very chearfully, and I told him what it was for,
that it was for' corn to make more bread, because
he was now with me, and that I might have enough
for him and myself too: He appeared very sensible
of that part, and let me know that he thought I
had much more labour upon me on his account
than I had for myself, and that he would work the
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleafante'st year of all the life I led
in this place; Friday began to talk pretty well, and
understand the names of almost every thing I had
occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send
him toy and talked a great deal to me; so that ift
short I began now to have some use for my tongue
again, which indeed I had very little occasion for
before, that is to fay about speech: besides the
pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satis-
faction in the fellow himself; his simple unfeigned
honesty appeared to me more and more every day,
and I began really to love the creature; and on his
side>
339
side I Believe he loved me more than it was possible
for him ever to love any thing before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again, and having
taught him English so well, that he could answer
me almost any questions, I asked him whether the
nation that he belonged to never conquered in
battle at which he smiled, and said yes, yes, we
always fight the better j that is, he meant, always
get the better in fight; and so we began the fol-
lowing discourse: You always fight the better,
said I, how came you to be taken prisoner then
Friday?
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Master. How beat! if your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many th&h my hation in
the place where me was • they take one, two,, three
and me; my nation over beat them in the yonder
place, where me no was; there my nation take
one, two, great thousand:
Master. But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?
Friday. They run one, two, thfee and uie,
and make go in the canoe: my niation have no
fcanoe that time.
Master Well, Friday,. and what does your na-
Z 2 tiori
\
tion with the men they take, do they carry them
away and eat them, as these did?
Friday Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all
up.
Master Where da they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither, come other
else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday Yes, I been here; (point to the N,
W. "side of die island) which it seems- was their
fide.
By this I understood that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages who used to
come on stiore on the farther part of the island,
on the same man-eating occasions that he was
now brought for; and sometime after, when I
took the courage to carry him to that fide, being
the same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew
the place, and told me he was there once when
they eat up twenty men, two women, and one
child; he could not tell twenty in English, but
he numbered them, by laying so many stones-
in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces
what follows f that after I had had this discourse
with.
with him, I asked him how far it was from our
island to the shore, and v/hether the canoes were
not often lost; he told me there was no danger,
aio canoes ever lost; but that after a little way
out to sea, there was a current and wind, always
one way in the morning, the other in the after-
noon. This I understood to be no more than
the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in;
but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by
the great draft and reflux of the mighty river
Oroonoko, in the mouth or the gulph of which
river, as I found afterwards, our island lay; and
this land which I perceived to the W. and N.
W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river; I asked Friday
a thousand questions about the country, the in-
habitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations
were near; lite told me all he knew, with the
greatest openness imaginable; I alked him the
names of the several nations of his fort of peo-
ple, but could get no other name than Caribs;
from whence I easily understood, that these were
the Caribbees, which our maps place oq the part
of America which reaches from the mouth of the
river Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to St.
Martha: he told me, that up a great way be-
yond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of
the moon, which must be W. from their coun •
try there dwelt white bearded men* like iw, and
Z 3 pointed
\
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned
before, and that they had killed much mans, that
was his word; by all which I understood, he
meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America
had been spread over the whole country, and
was remembered by all the nations from father to
son.
I en quired if he could tell me how I might
come from this island, and get among those white
men; he told me, yes, yes, I might go in two
canoe; I could not understand what he meant, or
make him describe to me what he meant by two
canoe, till at last with great difficulty, I found
he meant it must be in a large boat as big as
two canoes. This part of Friday's discourse be-
gan to relish with me very well, and from this
time I entertained some hopes that one time or
other I might find an opportunity to make my
escape from this place, and that this poor savage
might be a means to help me to do it.
During the long time that Friday had now-
been with me, and that he began to speak to
me, and understand me, I was not wanting to
lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind; particularly I asl<ed him one time who
made him? The poor creature did not understand
me, at all, but thought I had asked him who vyas
his fatherbut I took it up by another handle^
and
343
and asked him who made the sea, the ground we
walked on, and the hills and woods he told me
it was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond
, all; he could describe nothing of this great per-
son, but that he wa,s very old, much older, he
said than the sea or the land, than the moon or
the stars; I asked him then if this old person had
made all things, why did not $11 things worship
him? he looked very grave, and with a perfect:
look of innocence said, " All things do fay O to
himI asked him if the people who die in his
country went away any where? He said yes, they
all went to Benamuckee; then I asked him whe-
ther these they eat up went thither too, he said,
yes,
From these things, I began to instruct him in
the knowledge of the true God: I told him that
the great maker of all things lived up there,
pointing up tqwards heaven; that he governs the
world by the fame power and providence by
which he had made it; that he was omnipotent,
and could do every thing for us, give every thing
to us, take every thing from us; and thus by
degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with
great attention, and received with pleasure die
notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us,
and of the manner of making our prayers to God,
and his being able tp hear us, even into heaven:.
Z 4 He
He told roe one day, that if our God could heap
us up beyond the fun, he must needs be a great-
er God than their Benamuckee, who lived but
little way off, and yet could not hear till they
went up to the great mountains where he dwelt,
to speak to him; I asked him if he ever went
jthither to speak to him; he said, no, they never
went that were young men, none went thither
but the old men, whom he called their Oowoca-
kee, that is, as I made him explain it to me,
their religious, or clergy, and that they went to
fay O, (so he called saying prayers) and then
comeback and told them what Benamuckee said;
by this I observed, that there is priest-craft even
amongst the most blinded ignorant pagans in the
world, and the policy of making a secret of religion
in order to preserve the veneration of the people to
the clergy, is not only to be found in the Roman
but perhaps among all the religions in the world,
even among the most brutisli and barbarous sa-
vages.
I endeavoured to clear up this point to my
man Friday, and told him, that the pretence of
their old men going up to the mountains to fay
O to their God Benamuckee, was a cheat, and
their bringing word from thence what he said was
much more so; that if they met with any answer,
or spake with any one there,, it must be with an
evil
345
eyil spirit: and then I entered into a long dis-
course with him about the Devil, the original
of him, his rebellion against God his enmity to
man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in
the dark parts of the world, to be worshipped instead
of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he
made use of to delude mankind to his ruin, how he
had a secret access to our passions and to our affec-
tions, to adapt his lhares so to our inclinations
as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and
run upon our destruction by our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right
notions in his mind about the devil, as it was
about the being of a God: nature assisted all my
arguments to evidence to him, even the necessity
of a great first cause and overruling governing
power, a secret directing providence, and of the
equity and justice of paying homage to him that
made us, and the like. But there appeared no-
thing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit;
of his original, his being, his nature, and above
all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw
us in to do so too > and the poor creature puzzl-
ed me pnce in such a manner, by a question
merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew
what to say to him. I had been talking a great
deal to him of the power of God, his omnipot-
ence, his aversion to sin, his being a consuming
fire
\
fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as he had!
made us all, he could destroy us and all the world
in a moment; and he listened with great serious-
ness < to me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the
devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and
used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs
, pf providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ
. ijv the world, and the like, cf Well, lays Friday,
but ygu fay God is so strong, so greats is he not
much strong, much might as the devil; Yes,
yes, fays I, Friday, God, is stronger than the
devil, God i$ above the devil, and therefore we
pray tQ God to tread him down xinder our feet,
and enable us to resist his temptations and quench
his fiery darts. But fays he again, if God much
stronger, much might as the devil, why God
j\o kill the devil, so make him no more do
wicked ??>
I was strangely surprised at his question, and
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified for
a casuist, or a solver of difficulties; and at first I
could not tell what to fay, so I pretended not to
hear him, and asked him what he said? But he
was too earnest for an answer to forget his ques-
tion, so that he repeated it in the very same broken
words
words as above. By this time I had recovered
myself a little, and I said " God will at last
punish him severely, he is reserved for the judg-
ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to
dwell with everlasting fire." This did nor satis-
fy Friday, but he returns upon me, repeating my
words, reserve at last, "Me no understands
but why not kill the devil now, not kill long
ago? You may as well ask me, said I, why God
does not kill you and me, when we do wicked
things here that ossend him? We are preserved to
repent and be pardoned. He mused a while at
this; well, well, fay, he, mighty affectionately,
that well, so you I, - devil, all wicked, all pre-
serve, repent,. God pardon all. Here I was run
down again by him to the last degree, and it was
£ testimony to me, how the meer notions of na-
ture, though they will guide reasonable creatures
to the knowledge of a God, and of a worship or
homage due to the supreme being, of God as the
consequence of our nature; yet nothing but di-
vine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus
Christ, and of a redemption purchased for us, of
^ mediator of the new covenant, and of an inter-
cessor at the foot-stool of God's throne; I fay,
nothing but a revelation from heaven can form
fhefe in the foul, and that therefore the gospel
pf our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean
||ie word of God, and the spirit of God promis-
ed
\
ADVENTURES OF
ed for the guide and sanctifier of his people, are
the absolutely necessary instructors of the fouls
of men, in the saving knowledge of God and the
, means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse between
me and my man, rising up hastily, a$ upon some
sudden occasion of going out; then sending him
for something a good way off, I seriously prayed
to God that he would enable me to instruct sav-
ingly this poor savage, assisting by his spirit the
heart of the poor ignorant creature, to receive
the light of the knowledge of God in Christ re-
conciling him to himself, and would guide me to
speak so to him from the word of God, as his
conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened,
and his foul saved. When he came again to
me, I entered into a long discourse with him
upon the subject of the redemption of man by
the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine
of tfte gospel preached from heaven, viz. of
repentance towards God, and faith in our blessed
Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as well as
I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on
him the nature of angels, but the seed of Ab-
raham, and how, for that reason, the fallen an*?
gels had no share in the redemption; that he
came only to the lost sheep of the house of Is-
rael; and the like.
I HAD
I had, God knows, more sincerity than know-
edge in all the methods I took for this poor
creature's instruction, and must acknowledge what
I believe all that act upon the fame principle will
find that in laying things opentohim,! really inform-
ed and instructed myself in many things, that either I
did not know, or had not fully considered before,
but which occurred naturally to my mind upon
searching into them, for information of this
poor savage j and I had more affection in my
enquiry ' after things upon this occasion, than ever
I felt before: so that whether this poor wild
wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great
reason to be thankful that ever he came to me:
My grief lat lighter upon me, my habitation grew
comfortable to me beyond, measure: and when
I reflected that in this solitary life which I had
been confined to, I had not only been moved
myself to look up to heaven, and to seek to the
hand that had brought me there, but was now
to be made an instrument, under providence; to
lave the life, and, for ought I knew, the foul of
a poor savage, and bring him to the true know-
ledge of religion, and of the christian doctrine,
that he might know Christ Jesus, to know whom
is life eternal. I fay, when I reflected upon all
these things, a secret joy ran through every part
of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I
was brought to this place, which I had so often
thought
ADVtNXtTRES
thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that
could possibly have befallen me.
In this thankful frame' I continued all the re-
mainder of my time, and the conversation which
emplyeid the hours between Friday and me, was
such as made the three years tyhich we lived
there together, perfectly and compleatly happy,
if any such thing as compleat happiness can be
formed in a sublunary state. This- savage was
now a good christian, a much betted than I,
though I have reason to hope, and bless God
for it, that we were equally penitent and com-
forted restored penitents: we had here the word
of God to read, and no farther off from his spirit
to instruct, than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself, in reading the scrip-
ture, to let him know, as Well as I could, the
meaning of What I read; and he again,- by his
serious enquiries and questionings, made me as I
laid before,- a much better scholar in the scrip-
ture-knowledge than I sliould ever have been by
my own private mere reading. Another thing I can-'
not refrain from observing here also,, from experience5
in this retired part of my life, viz. how infinite
and inexpressible a blessing it is, that the know-
ledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation
by Christ Jesusy is so plainly laid down in the
word os God, so easy to be received and under-'
stood;
stood j that as the bare reading the scripture
made me capable of understanding enough of my
duty to carry me directly on to the great work
of sincere' repentance for my sins, and laying hold
of a saviour for life and salvation, to a stated
reformation in practice and obedience to all God's
commands; and this without any teacher, or in-
structed I mean human; so the fame plain in-
struction sufficiently served to the enlightning
rhis savage creature* and bringing him to be such
a christian, as I have known few equal to him in
my life.
As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife and
contention, which have happened in he world
about religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or
schemes of church-government, they were all per -
fectly useless to us'; as for ought I can yet fee,
they have been'to all the rest of the world; we
had the sure guide to heaven, viz. the word of
God, and we had blessed be God, comfortable
views of the spirit of God teaching and instruct-
ing us by his word, leading us into all truth, and
making us both willing and obedient to the in-
struction of his word; and I cannot fee the
least use that the greatest knowledge of the dis-
puted points in religion, which have made such
confusions in the world, would have been to us
it we could have obtained it; but I must go
5 on
On with the historical part of things, and takfc
every part in its order:
After Friday and I became more intimately
acquainted, and that he could understand almost
all I said to him,, and speak pretty fluently, though
in broken English, to me, I acquainted him with
my own history, or at least so much of it as related to
my coming into this place, how I had lived there*
and how long: I let him into the mystery, for such
it was to him, of gun-powdef and bullet, and taught
him how to stioot. I gave him a knife, which
he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made
him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as in
England we wear hangers in, and in the frog, in-
stead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which
was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but
much more useful upon other occasions.
I described to him the country of Europe*
particularly England* which I came from; fiow
we lived, how we worshipped God, how we be-
haved to one another* and how We traded in (hips
to all parts of the world i I gave him an account
of the wreck which I had been on board ofy
and shewed, him, as near as I could, the place
where (he lay; but ihe was all beaten in pieces
before, and gone.
4
I SHEW&I?
353
I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which
we lost when we escaped, and which I could not
stir with my whale strength then; but was noW
fallen almost all to pieces: upon seeing this boat,
Friday stood musing a great while and said no-
thing; I asked him what it was he studied upont
at last fays he, me fee such boat like come to
place at my nation/'
I did not understand him a good while; but
at last, when I had examined farther into it* I
understood by him, that a boat, such as that had
been, came on shore upon the country where he
lived; that is, as he explained it, was driven thi-
ther by stress of weather: I presently imagined,
that some European ship must have been cast
away upon their coast, and the boat might get
loose, and drive ashore; but was so dull, that I
never once thought of men making their escape
from a wreck thither, much less whence they might
come; so I only enquired after a description of
the boat."
Friday described the boat to me well enough;
but brought me better to understand him, when
he added with some warmth, <c we save the
white mans from drownthen I presently afl<:ed
him, if there were any white mans as he called them
in the boat; yes, he said, "the boat full white
mans
A a
man." I asked him how many; he told upon
his fingers seventeen: I asked him then what
became of them; he told me, cc they live, they
dwell at my nation."
This put new thoughts into my head; for I
presently imagined, that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that was cast away in the
fight of my island, as I now called it; and who
after the ship was stuck on the rock, and they
law her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in
their boat, and were landed upon that wild shore
among the savages..
Upon this I enquired of him more critically,
what was become of them: he assured me they
lived still there; that they had been there about
four years; that the savages let them alone, and
gave them victuals to live on. I asked-him, how
it came to . pass they did not kill them, and eat
them? He said, "No, they make brother with
them;" that is, as I understood him, a truce; and
then he added, "they no eat mans but when make
the war fight;" that is to fay, they never eat any
men but such as come to fight with them,; and are
taken in battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that
being upon the top of the hill, at the east side of
the island, from whence as I have said, I had in a
clear
355
clear day discovered die main or continent of
America, Friday, the weather being very serene,
looks very earnestly towards the main land, and
in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dan ing,
and calls out to me, for I was at some distance
from him; I asked him what was the matter ?" O
joy!" fays he, "O .glad! there fee my country,
there my nation!" I observed an extraordinary
lenfe of pleasure appeared in his face, and his
eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a
strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his
own country again; and this observation of mine
put a great many thoughts into me, which .made
me at first: not so easy about my new man Friday
as I was before; and I made no doubt, but that
if Friday could get back to his own nation again,
he ^ypuld not only: forget all his religion, but all
his j obligation to me, and would, be forward e-
nough to give his countrymen an account of me,
and come back perhaps with an hundred or two
of them* and make a feast upon me, at which.he
migltf be as merry as he used to be ,wjth those of
his enemies, when they were taken in war. ..  \
But I wronged the poor honest -creature very
much, for which I: ;was, very sorry afterwards::
H owever, as my jealqufy increased, and held me
some weeks, I was a'little more circumspect:, and
not* so familiar arid kind to him as before: in
which I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest
A a 2 grate-
\
grateful creature having no thought about it, but
what consisted with the best principles, both as
a religious christian, and as a grateful friend, as
appeared afterwards, to my full satisfaction.
While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be
sure I was every day pumping him, to fee if he
would discover any of the new thotights which I
suspected were in him; but I found every thing
he said was so honest and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion, and in spite
of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely
his own again nor did he in the least perceive
that I was tineasy, and therefore I could not suspect
him of deceit.
One day walking up the same hill, but the
weather being hazy at sea, so that we could not
see the continent, I called to him, and said,
Friday, "do not you wisli yourself in your own
country, your o\vn nation. Yes, he said, he be
much glad to be at his own nation. What would
you do there, said I, would you turn wild again,
eat mens flesh again, and be a savage as you were
before?" He looked full of concern, and stiaking his
head, said, "No, no, Friday tell them to live good
tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle-flesh, milk,no eat man again. Why then, said
I to him, they will kill you," He looked grave at
that, and then said,cc No,no, they no. kill me, they
willing love learn."He meant by this, they would be
will-
willing to learn, he added, fc they learned much of
the bearded mans that came in the boat. " Then I
asked him if he would go back to them? he smiled
at that, and told me that he could not swim so
far. I told him I would make a canoe for him.
He told me, he would go if I would go with
him." I go, says I, why they will eat me if I
come there. No, no, fays he,^ me make they no
eat you, me make they much love you." He
meant he would tell them how 1, had killed his
enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make
.them love rne; then he told me, as well as he could,
how kind they were to seventeen white men, or
bearded men, as he called them, who came on
fliore there in distress.
From this time I confess I had a mind to
venture over, and fee if I could possibly join with
those bearded men, who I made no doubt were
Spaniards or Portuguese, not doubting but if I
could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good
company together, better than I could from an
island forty miles off the shore, and alone without
help. So after some days I took Friday to work
again, by way of discourse, and told him I would
give him a boat to go back to his own nation, and
accordingly I carried him to my frigate, which
lay on the other side of the island, and having
cleared it of water (for I always kept it funk in the
2 A 3 water
water) I brought it out, shewed it him, and we
both went into it. I found he was a most dexte-
rous fellow at managing it, and would make it go
almost as swift again as I could; so when he was
in 11 said to him, u Well now, Friday, shall v/e
go to your nation?" He looked very dull at my
saying so, which it seems was, because he thought
the boat too small to go so far; I told him then I
had a bigger; so the next day I went to the place
where the first boat lay which I had made, but
which I could not get into the water He said that
was big enough; but then as I had taken no care
of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years
there, the fun had split and dryed it, that it was
in a manner rotten. Friday told me such a boat
would do very well, and would carry "much
enough vittle, drink, brea,d," that was his way of
talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed
upon my design of going over with him to the
continent, that I told him, we would go and
make one as big as that, and he should go home
in it. He answered not one word^ but looked
very grave and lad; I asked him what was the
matter with him? he asked me again, thus, "Why
you angry mad with Friday, what me done?" I
asked him what he meant? I told him I was not
angry with him at all, y No angry! No angry ?'*
fays-
says he, repeating the words several times, "Why
lend Friday home away to my nation? Why fays I,
Friday, did not you fay, you wished you v/ere
there? Yes yes,"'fays he, "wisti be both there,
no wish Friday there, no master there." In a
word he would not think of going there without
me, "I go there Friday, fays I, what {hall I do
there? he returned very quick upon me at this;
u You do great deal much good, fays he, you
teach wild man's to be good sober tame mans; you
tell them know God, pray God, and live new
life.. . Alas! Friday, fays I, thou knowest not
what thou sijiyestj I am but an ignorant man
myself: Ye4 yes, lays he, you teachee me good,
you teachee them good. No no Friday fays I,
6i You shall go without me, leave me here to
live by myself, as I did before." He looked
confused again at that word and running to one
of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it
up hastily, comes, and gives it to me, c< What
must I do with this?" fays I to him. "You
take kill Friday, fays he. <f What must I kill
you for? Said I again. He returns very quick,
u What you fend Friday away for? Take kill
Friday no fend Friday away. This he spoke so
earnestly, that 1 saw tears stand in his eyes: in a
word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection
in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that
I told him then, and often after, that I would
A a 4 never
never send him away from me, if he was willing
to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse
a settled affection to me, and that nothing should
part him from me, so I found all th« foundation
of his desire to go to his own country, was laid
in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes
of my doing them good; a thing; which as I had
no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought,
or intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still
I found a strong inclination to my attempting an
escape as above, founded on the supposition ga-
thered from the discourse, viz. that there were
seventeen bearded men there: therefore, without
any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to
find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a
large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage.
There were trees enough in the island; to have
built a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes,
but even of good large vessels: but the main
thing I looked at, was to get; one so near the water
jthat we might launch it when it was made, to
avoid the mistake I committed at first.
At }ast, Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found
Jie knew much better than I, what kind of wood
was fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what
lypod to c^ll the tree we cut dov^n, except it was
• very
very like the tree we call fustic, or between that
and the nicarigus wood, for it was much of the
fame colour and smell. Friday was for burning the
hollow, or cavity of this tree out, to make it for
a boat; but I shewed him how rather to cut it out
with tools, which, after I had shewed him how to
life, he did very handily, and in about a month's
hard labour, we finished it, and made it very hand-
some, especially when with our axes, which I
shewed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the
outside into the true shape of a boat: after this
however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get
her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great
rowlers into the water. But when she was in, slie
would have carried twenty men with great ease.
When she was in the water, and though she was
ib big, it amazed me to fee, with what dexterity,
and how swift my man Friday would manage her,
tifrn her, and paddle her along; so I asked him
if he would, and if we might venture over in her;
"Yes he said, he venture over in her very well,
though great blow wind." However, I had a far-
ther design, that he knew nothing of, and that
was to make a mast and a fail, $nd to fit her with
an anchor and cable; as to a mast, that was easy
enough to get; so I pitched upon a strait young
cedar tree, which I found near the place, and
wtych there were "great plenty of in the island;
and

and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and
gave him directions how to shape, and order it.
But as to the fail, that was my particular care; I
knew I had old fails, or rather pieces of old fails
enough; but as I had them now six and twenty-
years by me, and had not been very careful to
preserve them, not imagining that I should ever
have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt
but they were all rotten, and indeed, most of
them were so; however, I found two pieces,
which appeared pretty good, and with these I
went to work, and with a great deal of pains and
aukward tedious stitching (you may be sure) for
want of needles, I at length made a three cornered
ugly thing, like what we call in England, a shoul-
der of mutton-fail, to go with a boom at bottom,
and a little stiort sprit at the top, such as usually
our ships long-boats fail with, and such as I best
knew how to manage because it was such an one,
as I had to the boat, in which I made my escape
from Barbary, as related in the first part of my
story
I was near two months, performing this last
work, viz. rigging and fitting my mast and fails;
for I finished them very com pleat, and making a
small stay, and a sail or fore-sail to if, to assist, if
we stiould turn to windward; and which was mdre
than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her,- to.
steer
steer with; and though I was a bungling ship-
wright, yet as I knew the usefulness, and even
necessity of such a thing; I applied myself with
so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to,
pass 1 though considering the many dull contri-
vances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me
almost as much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done too, I had my man
Friday to teach as to what belonged to the na-
vigation of my boat 5 for though he knew very
well how to paddle a canoe, Jie knew nothing what
belonged to a fail, and a rudder; and was the most
amazed, when he saw me work the boat to and
again ifi the sea by the rudder, and how the sail
gibbed, and filled this way, or that way, as the
course we sailed changed -> I say, when he saw this,
he stood like one astonished, and amazed. How-
ever, with a little use, I made all these things
familiar to him; and he became an expert sailor,
except that as to the compass, I could make him
understand very little of that. On the other hand,
as there was very little cloudy weather, and sel-
. dom or never any fogs in those parts, there was
the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars
were always to be seen by night, and the shore by
day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody
c^red to stir abroad, either by. land or sea.
\
I was
I was now entered on the seven and twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the
three last years, that I had this creature with me,
ought rather to be left out of the account, my
habitation, being quite of another kind, than in
all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of
my landing here, with the fame thankfulness to
God, for his mercies as at first; and if I had such
cause of acknowledgement at first, I had much
more so now, haying such additional testimonies
of the care of providence over me, and the great
. hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had an invincible impression
upon my thought, that my deliverance was at
hand, and that I should not be another year in
this place: however, I went on with my husban-
dry, digging, planting, fencing, as usual: I
gathered and cured my grapes, and did every
necessary thing as before.
The rainy season was now in the mean time
upon me, when I kept more within doors, than
at other times; so I had stowed qur new vessel as
secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek,
where, as I said, in the begining, I landed my
rafts from the ship, and hauling her up to the
shore, at high water mark, I made my man
Friday dig a little dock just big enough to hold
her, and just deep enough to give her water
enough
enough to float in: and then when the tide was
out, we made a strong dam cross the end of it,
to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as to
the tide from the sea; and to keep the rain off,
we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick,
that flie was as well thatched as a house j and thus
we waited for the months of November and De-
cember, in which I designed to make my adven-
ture.
WHEN*the settled season began to come in, as
the thought of my design returned with the fair
weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage:
and the first thing I did, was to lay by a certain
quantity of provisions, being the stores for our
voyage; and intended in a week or a fortnights
time, to open the dock, and launch out our boat.
I was busy one morning upon.something of this
kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go
to the sca-stiore, and fee if he could find a turtle,
or tortoise, a thing, which we generally got once
a week, for the sake of the eggs, as well as the
flesh: Friday had not been long gone, when he
came running back, and flew over my outer wall,
or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the
steps he set his feet on -y and before I had time to
speak, to him, he cries out to me, Cf O master!
O master! O sorrow! O bad! What's the matter,
Friday fays I, O yonder, there, fays he, one, two,
. 1 three
\
three canoe! one, two, three" by this way of
speaking, I concluded there were six, but on en-
quiry, I found it was but three: well, Friday,
lays I, do not be frighted; so I heartened him up
as well as I could: however, 1 law the poor fellow
was most terribly scared, for nothing ran in his
head, but that they were come to look for him,
and would cut him in pieces, and eat him; and the
poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what
to do with him: I comforted him as well as I could,
and told him I was in asmuch danger as he, and
that they would eat me as well as him; but fays
I Friday, cc we must' resolve to fight them: can
you fight? Friday. Me Ihoot, says he, but there
come many great number. No matter for that,
said,I again, our guns will fright them that we do
not kill ?"'so Talked him whether, if I resolved to
defend him, he would defend me, and stand by
me, and do just as I bid him: he said, "Me die
when you bid die, master." So I went and fetched,
a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had
been so good a husband of my rum, that I had a
great deal left: when he had drank it, I made him
take the two fowling pieces, which we always
carried, and loaded them with large swan shot, as
big as small pistol bullets; then I took four mus-
kets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five
small bullets each; and my two pistols, I loaded
with a brace of bullets each; I hung my great
< word
sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Fri-
day his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective glass, and went up to the side of the
hill, to fee what I could discover; and I found
quickly1 by my glass, that there was one and
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes,
and that their whole business 'teemed to be the
triumphant banquet upon .these;three human, bo-
dies, (a barbarous feast: indeed) but nothing more
than, as. I had observed, was usual with them, .:
; I observed-also, that they: ^ere landed, not
.where they had done when Friday made his escape,
but nearer to my creek, whe:re the ,shore was low,
and where a thick wood came close almost down
to the sea: this, with the abhorrence of the in-
human errand these wretches came about, filled me
with such indignation, that I came down again to
Friday, and told him, I was. resolved to go down
to them and kill them all -y and asked him if he
would stand by me? he was, now gotten over
his fright, and/his spirits being a little raised with
the dram I had given him, he was very chearful,
and told me, as before, " he would die, when I
bid die;"

ADVENTURES OF
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided thfc
arms which I had charged, as before, between us;
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder, and ^ took one pistol
and the other three myself j and in this posture we
marched out: I took a small bottle of rum in my
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more
powder and bullet; and as to orders, I charged him
to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot,
or do any thing till I bid him > and in the mean
time, not to speak a word: in this posture, I
fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile,
as well to get over the creek, as to get into the
wood, so that I might come within shot of them
before I should be discovered, which I had seen
by my glass it was easy to do4
While I was making this marcJh, my formes
thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolu^
tion j I do not mean, that I entertained any fear of
their number, for as they were naked, unarmed
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them*
nay, though I had been alone \ but it occured
to my thoughts, what call? What occasion?
Much less what necessity I was in to go and dip
my hands in blood, to attack people who had
neither done or intended me any wrong? Who as
to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous cus~
oms were their own disaster, being in them indeed
a token
a token of God's having left them, with the other
nations of that part of the world, to such stupidity,
and to such inhuman courses, but did not call me
to take upon me to be a judge of their actions,
much less an executioner of his justice; that when-
ever he thought fit he would take the cause into
his own hands, and by national vengeance punish
them, as a people for national crimes j but that in
the mean time^ it was none of my business; that
it was true, Friday might justify it, because he
was a declared enemy, and in a state of war with
those very particular people, and it was lawful for
him to attack them, but I could not fay the fame
with respect to myself. These things were so
warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as
I went, that 1 resolved I would only go and
place myself near them, that I might observe their
barbarous feasts and that I would act then as God
should direct* but that unless something offered
that was morie a call to me than yet I knew of, I
would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood and,
with all possible warinels and silence, Friday sol*
lowing close at my heels, I marched till I came to
the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next
to them* only that one corner of the wood lay
between me and them; here I called softly to
Friday, and (hewing him a great tree, which was
B b just
just at the corner of the wood, I bad him go to ih£
treey and bring me word if he could fee there plainly
what they were a doing; he did so, and came imme-
diately back to me, and told me they might be
plainly viewed there, that they were all about
their fire, eating the flesti of one of their prisoners,
and that another lay bound upon the sand, a lit'tle
from them, which he said they would kill next,
and which fired all the very soul within me j he
tdld me it was not one of their nation, but one of
the bearded men, who he had told me of, that came
to their country in the boat: I was filled with horror
at the very naming the white bearded man, and
going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a
white man who lay upon the beach of the sea,
with his hands and his feet tied with flags, or things
like rushes; and that he was an European, and had
cloaths on.
, There was another tree, arid a little thicket
beyond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than
the place where I was, which by going a little way
about* I saw I might come at undiscovered, and
that then I should be within half a shot of them-
so I with-held my paflion, though I was indeed
enraged to the highest degree, and going back
about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes
which held all the way, till' I came to the other
tree, and then I came to a little rising ground)
: winch
which gave me a full view of them, at the distance
bf about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen
of the dreadful wretches fat upon the ground, all
close huddled together,- and had just sent the other
two to btttchei* the poor Christian, and bring him
perhaps limb by limb to their fire, and they were
stodped down to linty the bands at his feet; (for
these prisoners were fast bound). I turned to
Friday, Now, Friday; said I,* cc do as I bid thee.
Friday said ht would: Then Friday, says I, do
exactly as you fee me do; fail in nothing:" So I
let down one bf the mtilkets afrd the fowlifig-piece
tipon the ground; and Friday did the like by his;
and with the other musket I took my aim at the
savages, biddirig him to do the like; then asking
him if he \vas ready; he said, yes; then fire at
them, said I; ahd the same rtlomerit I fired also.
Friday to6k his aim ib fruicfi better than I;
that dii the side that he shot he killed two of them,
and wouiided three more? and on my side I killed
one and wounded two.- They were, you may be
fuse, in a dreadful consternation, and all of them
Mib were riot htfrt jumped tip trpoft their feet; but
did not immediately know which way to run or
fahich way to look, for they knew not from whence
their destruction came: Friday kept his eyes close
B b % tipor*
\
upon me, that as I had bid him, he might observe
what I did; so as soon as the first shot was made, I
threw down the piece and took up the fowling-
piece and Friday did the like; he saw me cock and
present* he did the same again: are you ready?
Friday said L Yes, fays he: Let fly then* fays I, in
the name of God; and with that I fired again among
the amazed wretches, and so did Friday, and as
our pieces were now loaden with what I called
swan sliot, or small pistol bullets, we found only
two drop, but so many wefe wounded, that they
ran about yelling and screaming like mad crea-
turesj all bloody ^ and miserably wounded most of
them, whereof three more fell quickly after,
though not quite dead;
Now, Friday, says I, (laying down the discharged
pieces, and taking up the mulket which was yet
loaden) follow me; which he did With a great deal
of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood*
and shewed myself, and Friday close a:t my foot $
as soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as
loud as I cduld, and bad Friday do so too, and
running as fast as I could, which by the way was
not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I
made directly towards the poor victim, who was,^
its' I faid^ lying upon the beach or shore between
the place where they sat and the sea; the two but-
chers who Were just going to work with him* had
left
Jest him at the surprize of our first fire, and fled in
a terrible fright to the sea side, and had jumped in-
to a canoe, and three more of the rest made the
same way; I turned to Friday and bad him step
forwards, and fire at them; he understood me imme-
diately, and running about forty yards, to be near-
er them, he shot at them, and I thought he had
killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap
into the boat, though I saw two of them up again
quickly; however he killed two of them, and
wounded the third so that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat, as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled
out my knife and cut the flags that bound the'
poor victim, and loosing his hands and feet, I
lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese
tongue, What he was? He answered in Latin,
Christianus, but was so weak and fainr that he
could scarce stand or speak; I took my bottle out
of my pocket and gave it him, making signs that
he sliould drink, which he did; and I gave him a
piece of bread, which he eat: Then I asked him
what country man he was; and he said, Espagni-
ole; and being a little recovered, let me know by
all the signs he could possibly make, how much
he was in my debt for his deliverance: Seignior,
laid I, with as much Spanish as I could make up,
cc we will talk afterwards but we must fight now

if you have any strength left, take this pistol and
sword, and lay about you." He took them very
thankfully and no sooner had he the arms in his
hands, but, as if they had put new vigour into
him, he flew upon his murtherers like a fury, and
had cut two of them in pieces in an instants
for the truth is, as the whole was a surprize to
them, so the poor creatures were so much fright-
ed with the noise of our pieces that they fell
down for mere amazement and fear, and had no
more power to attempt their own escape, that)
their flesli had to resist our shot; and that was
the cafe of those five that Friday Ihot at in the
^boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they
received the other two fell with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still without
firing, being willing to keep my charge ready,
because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and
sword; so I called to Friday, and bad him run
up to the tree from whence we first fired, and
fetch the arms which lay there that had been
discharged, which he did with great swiftness and
then giving him my musket, I set down myself
to load all the rest again, and bid them come
to me when they wanted: while I was loading
these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement
between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
who made - at him with one of their great wood-
en
en swords, the fame like weapon that was to have
killed him before, if I had not prevented it.
The Spaniard, who was as bold and -brave
as could be imagined though weak, had fought
this Indian a good while, and had .cut him two
great wounds on his head, but the savage being
a stout lusty fellow, closing in with him? had
thrown him down (being faint) and was wring-
ing my sword out of Jiis hand, when the Spanir
ard, though undermost, wisely quitting the sword
drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage
through the body, and killed him upon the spot
before I, who was running to help him, could
come near him,
Friday being now leftto his liberty, pursued
the flying wretches, with no weapon in his hand
-but his hatchet, and with that he dispatched those
three, who, as I said before, were wounded at
first and fallen, and all the rest he could come up
with; and the Spaniard coming to me for a
gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with
which he pursued two of the savages, and wound-
ed them both; but, as he was not able to run,
they both got from him into the wood, where
.Friday pursued them, and killed one of them,
but the other was too nimble for him, and though
he was wounded, yet he had plunged himself into
the sea, and swam with all his might off to those
B b 4 tw$

two who were left in the canoe; which three in
the canoe, with one wounded that we know not
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our
hands of one and twenty; the account of the rest
is as follows i
3 Killed at our first shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
a Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto of those at first wounded,
i Killed by ditto in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there
of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his;
chafe \of them.
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wound-
ed, if not dead,
2i In all.
. Those that were in the caaoe worked hard to
get out of gun shot, and though Friday madq
two br three shots at them, I did not .find that
he hit any of them? Friday would fain have had
me take one of their canoes, and pursue them,
and indeed I was very anxious about their escape,
lest carrying the news home to their people,
they should come back perhaps with two or three
hundred of their canoes^ and devour us by mere
mul-
377
multitude: So 1 consented to pursue them by sea,
and running to one of their canoes I jumped in,
and bad Friday follow me; but when I was. in
the canoe, I was surprized to find another poor
creature lye there, bound hand and foot, as the
Spaniard was, for the slaughter and almost dead
with fear, not knowing what the matter was:
for he had not been able to look up over the
side of the boat, he was tied, so hard neck an4
heels, and had been tied so long that he had
really but little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not stand or Ipeak,
]but groaned most piteoyfly, believing it seems still
that he was only unbound in order to be killed.
When Friday came to him I bad him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; anji pulling
put my bottle, made him give the poor wretch
a dram, which, with the news of his being de-
livered, revived him, and he fat up in the boat;
but when Friday came to hear him speak, and
look in his face, it would have moved, any one
to tears to fee how' Friday kissed him, em-
braced him, hugged him, cryed,! laughed ho-
looed, jumped about, danced, fung, then cryed
again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and
head,, and then fung, and jumped about again,
like
\" .' ''
like a distracted creature. It was a good while before
I could make him speak to me, or tell me what
was the matter; but when he came a little to him-
self, he told me that it was his father.
It is not easy for me to express how it mov-
ed me to fee what extaly and filial affection had
worked in this poor savage at the sight of his
father, and of his being delivered from death;
nor indeed can I describe half the extravagancies
of his affection after this, for he went into the
boat and out of the boat a great many times:
when he went into him, he would fit down by
him, open his breast, and hold his father's
head close to his bosom for many minutes to-
gether, to nourish it; then he took his arms
and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the
binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his
hands, and I, perceiving what the cafe was, gave
him some rum out of my bottle to rub them
with, which did them a great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the
canoe, with the other savages, who were now
gotten almost out of sight j and it was happy for
us that we did not, for it blew so hard within
rwo hours after, and before they could be gotr
ten a quarter of their way, and continued blow-
ing so hard all night, from the north-west,
which
which was against them, that I could not sup-
pose their boat could live, or that they ever reach-
ed their own coast.
But to return to Friday, he was so busy about
his father, that I could not find in my heart to
take him off for some time: but after I thought
he could leave; him a little, I called him to me,
and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased
to the highest degree; then I asked him, if he
had giyen his father any bread? He shook his
jhead and said, none: 6 Ugly dog eat all up self
so I gave him a cake of bread out of a little
pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a
dram for himself, but he would not taste it, but
carried it to his father; I had in my pocket also
two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him
a handful of them for his father. He had no
sooner given his father these raisins but I saw
him come out of the boat, and run away, as if
he had been bewitched, he run at such a rate;
for he was the swiftest fellow of his feet
that ever I saw; I say, he run at such a rate,
that he was out of sight, as it, were, in an in-
stant, and though I Called and holooed too, after
him, it was all one, away he went, and in a
quarter of an hour, I saw him come back again
^though not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer,
nearer, I found his pace was flacker, because he
had something in his hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had
been quite home for an earthen jugg or pot to
bring his father some fresh water, and that he
had got two more cakes or loaves of bread; the
bread lie gave me, but the water he carried to his
-father: however, as I was very thirsty too, I took
a little sup of it. The water revived his.father
more than all the rum or spirits I had given
him 3 for he was just fainting with thirst.
When his father had drank, I called to him
to know if there was any water left; he said,
yes; and I bad him give it to the poor Spani-
ard, who was in as much want of it as his fa-
ther; and I sent one of the cakes that Friday
brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed
very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green
place under the shade of a tree ;. and whose limbs
were also very stiff, and very much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with, when
I saw that upon Fridays coming to him with
the water, he fat up and drank, and took the
bread, and began to eat, I went to him and gave
him a handful of raisins; he looked up in my
face with all the tokens of gratitude and thank-
fulness, that could appear in any countenance;
but
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so ex-
erted himself in the fight, that he could not stand
up upon his feet: he tryed to do it two or three
times, but was really not able, his ankles were so
swelled and so painful to him; so I bad him sic
still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and
bathe them with rum as he had done his fa-
ther's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every
two minutes or perhaps less, all the while he
was here, turned his head about, to fee if his fa-
ther was in the fame place* and posture as he
left him sitting; and at last he found he was not
to be seen: at which he started up, and without
speaking a. word flew with that swiftness to him,
that one could scarce perceive his feet to touch
the ground, as he went: but when he came he
only found he had laid himself dowrf to ease his
Hmbs; so Friday came back to me presently*
and then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday
help him up if he could* and lead him to the
boat, and then he should carry him to our dwell-
ing, where I would take care of him, but Fri-
day a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite
up upon his back$ and carried him away to the
boat, and set him. down softly upon the side or
gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside
6f it; and then# lifting him quite in, he set him
close

close td his father, and presently stepping out
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along
the sliore faster than I could walk, thotigh the
wind blew pretty hard too'; so he brought them'
safe out into our creek? and leaving them in the
boat, runs away to fetch the other canOe. A she
passed me^ I spoke to him and asked him whither
he went, he told me, go fetch more boat; so
away he went like the wind; for sure never man
or horle run like him,* and he had the other
canoe in the creak, almost as soon as I got to'
it by land; so he wafted me, over and then went
to help our new guests out of tht boat, which
he did; but they were neither of them able to
walk; so that poor Friday knew not what- id
do.
To remedy, this, I went to work in my fhcfught*
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on?
the bank while he came to me, I soon made a
kind of a hand-barrow to lay them on, and Fri-
day and I carried them, both up together upon
it between us. But when we got them to the
outside of our wall or fortification, we we're at
a worse loss than before, for I hardly thought
it possible to get them over, and I was resolved
 not to break it down; so I set to work againy
aud Friday, and I, in about two hours time made
a very handsome tent, covered with old iails,
an4
/
and above that with boughs of trees, being in
the space without our outward fence and between
that and the grove of young wood which I had
planted; and here we made them two beds of
such things I had (viz) of good rice-straw, with
blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to
cover them on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought
myself very rich in subjects; and it was a merry
reflection which I frequently made how like a
king I looked. First of all, the whole country
was my own mere property; so that I had an un-
doubted right of dominion, 2dly, My people were
perfectly subjected: I was absolutely lord and
law giver; they all owed their lives to me, and
were ready to lay down their lives if there had
been occasion of it, for me. ,It was remarkable
too, I had but three subjects and they were of
three different religions. My man Friday was
a protestant, his father was a pagan and a can-
nibal, and the Spaniard was a papist; however
I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my
dominions: But this is by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter and a place to^
rest them upon, I began to think of making some
provision for them: and the first thing I did, I
order-
ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt
a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to'
be killed j when I cut off the hinder quarter*
and choping it into small pieces, I set Friday to
work to boiling and stewing, and made them a
very good dish, I assure you, os flesti and broth;
having put some barley and rice also into the broth;
and as I cooked it wkhotit doors, for I made no
fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into
the new tent; and having set a table there for
them, I fat down and eat my own dinner also
with them, and as well as I could cheared them
and encouraged them: Friday being my inter-
preter^ especially to his father, and indeed to the
Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the langu-
age of the savages pretty well.
After we had dined,; or rather supped, I or-
dered Friday to> take one of the canoes* and go
and fetch our muskets and other fire arms, which
for want of time we had left upon the place of
battle, and the next day I ordered him to go
bury the dead bodies of thfc savages, which lay
open to the fun, and would presently be offen-
sive; and I also ordered him to bury the horrid
remains of their barbarous feast, which I knew
were pretty much,' and which I could not think
of doing myself; nay, 1 could hot bear to fee
them if I went that way: all which he punctually
performed, and defaced the very appearance of
5 the-
fchfe savages being there; so that when I went
again, I could scarce know where it was, other-
. wife than by the corner of the wood pointing to
the place,
I the** began to enter into & little conversa-
tion, with my two new subjects; and first: I sent
Friday to enquire of his father what he thought
of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and
whether we might expect a return of them with
a power too great for us to resist: his first opi-
nion was, that the savages in the boat never could
live out the storm that blew that night they went
off, but must of necessity be drowned or driven
*outh to those other shores where they were as sure
to be devoured as they were to the drowned if
they were cast away; but as to what they would
do if they came safe on shore, he said he knew
not; but iit was his opinion that they were so
dreadfully frighted with the manner of their being
attacked, the noise and the fire, that he believed
they would tell the people they were all killed
by thunder and lightning, not by, the hand of
man, and that the two which appeared, (viz*)
Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits or furies
come down to destroy them, and not men with
~ weapons; This he said he knew, because he heard
them all cry out so in their language to one a-
nother, for it was impossible for them to con-
C c ceive
\
ADVENT IT RES OF
ceive that a man could dart fire and speak thunder
and kill at a distance without lifting up the hand
as was done now; and this old savage was in'
the right; for, as I understood since by other
hands, the savages never attempted to go over
to the island afterwards; they were so terrified with
the accounts given by those four men, (for it seemsi
they did escape the sea) that they believed who-
ever went to 'that enchanted island would be de-
stroyed with fire from the Gods.
Tms however I knew not, and therefore was
under continual apprehensions for a good while,
and kept always upon my guard, with all my ar-
my; for as there were now four of us, I would
have ventured upon an hundred of them, fairly
i:n the open field at any time*
In a little time however, no more canoes ap-
pearing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I
began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to
the main into consideration, being likewise assur-
ed by Friday's father, that I might depend upon
good usage from their nation, on his account,
if I would go. But my thoughts were a little
suspended when I had a serious discourse with the
Spaniard, and when I understood that there were
sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese,
who having been cast away, and made their escape
to
to that side, lived there at peace indeed with the
savages, but were very fore put to it for necessa-
ries, and indeed for life: I asked him all the par-
ticulars of their voyage, and 'found they were a
Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to
the Havanna, being directed to leave their loading
there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and to
bring back what European goods they could meet
with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen
on board, whom they took out of another wreck;
that five of their own men were drowned, when the
first ship was lost, and that these escaped through
infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived almost
starved, on the cannibal coast, where they expects
ed to have been devoured every moment. He
told me they had some arms with them, but they
were perfectly useless, for that they had neither
powder or ball, the washing of the sea having
spoiled all their powder, but a little, which they
used at their first landing, to provide themselves
for food*
I asked him what he thought would become
of them there, and if they had formed no design of
making any escape? He said, they had many
consultations about it, but that having neither
vessel* or tools to build one, or provisions of any
kind, their councils always ended in tears and
despair.
C C 2 I ASKED
I asked him how he thought they would receive
a proposal from me, which might tend towards arc
escape 5 and whether, if they were all here, it
might not be done? 1 told him with freedom, I
feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me,
if I put my life in their handsj for that gratitude
was no inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor
did men always square their dealings by the obli-
gations they had received, so much as they did by
the advantages they expected. I told him it would
be very hard that I should be the instrument of
their deliverance, and that they should aftei wards
make me their prisoner in New Spain,, where an
Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice,
what necessity, or what accident soever brought him
thither -y and that I had rather be delivered up to
the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into
the merciless claws of the priests, and be carried
into the inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was
persuaded, if they were all here, we might with
so many hands, build a bark large enough to
Carry us all away, either to the Brasils southward,
or to the islands, or Spanish coast northward, but
that if in requital they should when I had put wea-
pons into their hands, carry me by force among
their own people, I might be ill used for my
kindness to them, and nuke my cafe worse thafi ,
k was before.
Ha
He answered with a great deal of candour and
ingenuity-, that their condition was so miserable,
chat they were so sensible os it, that he believed,
they would abhor the thought of using any man
unkindly, that should contribute to their deliver-
ance; and that if I pleased, he would go to them
•with the old man, and discourse with them about
it, and return again, and bring me -their answer;
that he would make conditions with them, upon
stheir solemn oath, that they should be absolutely
binder my leading, as their commander and cap-
tain: and that they should swear upon the holy
sacraments, and the gospel to be true to me, and
go to such christian country as that Œ should agree
to, and no other, and to -be directed wholely and
absolutely by my orders, tiU they were landed
safely in suqh country as I intended 3 and that he
would bring a contract from them under their
'hands for that purpose. Then he told me, he
would first swear to me himself, that he would
*never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave
him ordersand that he would take my side to the
last drop of his blood, if there should happen the
least breach of faith among his countrymen. He
Æold me they were all of them very civil honest
.men, and they were under the greatest distress
imaginable, having neither weapons or cloaths.,
<mr any food but at the mercy and discretion of the
savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their
C C 3 OWE
own country; and that he was sure, if I would
undertake their relief, they would live and die by
me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them if possible, and to send the old savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when
we had gotten all things in readiness to go, the
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had
so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but
be very well satisfied in it; and by his advice put
off the deliverance of his comrades, for at least
half a year; the cafe was thus.
He had been with us now about a month, dur-
ing which time I had let him fee in what manner
I had provided, with the assistance of providence,
for my support, and he saw evidently what stock
of corn and rice I had laid up; which though it
was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not
sufficient, without good husoandry, for my family,
now it was encreafed to number four: but much
less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who
were, as he said, fourteen still alive, should come
over: and least of all, would it be sufficient to
victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a
voyage to any of the! christian colonies of America:
so he told me, he thought it would be more ad-
visable
disable to let him and die other two dig and
cultivate some more land, as much as I could
spare leed to sow, and that we should wait an-
other harvest; that we might have a supply of corn
for his countrymen when they should come, for
want might be a temptation -to them to disagree,
or not to think themselves delivered otherwise
than out of one difficulty into another. <c You
know says he, cf the children of Israel, though
they rejoiced at first, for their being delivered out of
Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himself,
that delivered them, when they came to want
.bread in the wilderness/'
His caution was so reasonable, and his advice
so good, that I could not but be very well pleased
with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with
his fidelity: so we fell to digging all four of us, as
well as the wooden tools we were furnished with
permitted, and in about a months time, by the
-end of which it was feed time, we had gotten as
much land cured and trimnied up, as we sowed
two and twenty bushels of barley on, and sixteen
jars of rice, which was all the feed we had to
spare: nor indeed, did we leave ourselves barley
sufficient for our own food, for the six months that
we had to expect our crop, that i$ to fay, reckonings
from the time we set our seed aside for sowing: for bis
C c 4 not
not to be supposed, it is six months in the ground
in that country.
Having now society enough, and our number
being sufficient, to put us out of fear of the savages,
if they had come, unless their number had been
very great, we went freely all over the island,
wherever we found occasion -9 and as here we
had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts,
it was impossible, at least for me, to have the
means of it out of mine; to this purpose I marked
omieveral trees which I thought fit for our work,
and I fet^Friday and his father to cutting them
down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I
imparted my thought on that affair, to oversee and
direct their work: I shewed them with what inde-
fatigable pains, I had hewed a large tree into
single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till
they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak, near two feet broad, thirty five feet long,
and from two inches to four inches thick: what
prodigious labour it took up, any one may ima-
gine.
At the fame time I contrived to increase my
little stock of tame goats as much as I could; and
to this purpoie I made Friday and the Spaniard
go out one day, and myself with Friday the next
iiay > for we took our turns; and by this means
- • we
got about twenty young kids, to breed up with
jthe rest, for whenever we shot the dam, we saved
the kids, and added them to our flock: but above
all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I
caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up
in the fun that I believe, had we been at Alicant,
where the raisins of the fiin are cured, we could
haye filled sixty or eighty barrels: and these with
our bread, was a great part of our food, and was
very good living too, I assure you, for it is an
exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good
order; it was not the most plentiful increale I
had seen in the island, but however, it was enough
to answer our end, for from twenty two bushels
of barley, we brought in and threshed out above
two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in
proportion of the rice, which was store enough for
our food, to the next harvest, thoughall the sixteen
Spaniards had been on shore with me, or if we had
been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully
have victualled our ship, to have carried us to anv
part of the world, that is to fay of America.
When we had thus housed and secured our
magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more
wicker ware, viz. great baskets in which we kept
it; and the Spaniard was veiy handy and dextrous
at
ADVENTURES OF
;afi this part, and often blamed me that I did not
make some things for defence of this kind of work.;
but I saw no need of it.
And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main., to fee what he could do with
those he had left behind him there. I gave him a
strict charge not to bring any man with him, who
would,not first swear in the presence of himself and
the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight
with or attack the person he should find in the
island, who was ib kind to fend for them in order
to their deliverance, but that they would stand by
Jiim, and defend him against all such attempts,
.and wherever they went would be intirely under
and subjected to his commands; and that this
should be put in writing, and signed with their
hands. How we were to have done this, when I
knew they had neither pen or ink, was a question
which we never asked.
Under these instructions the Spaniard and the
old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one
of the canoes, which they might be said to come
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave
each of them a musket with a firelock on it, and
about eight charges of powder and ball, charging
them
395
them to be very good husbands of both, and not
to use either of them but upon urgent occasion.
This was a chearful work, being the first mea-
sures used by me in view of my deliverance, for
now twenty seven years and some days. I gave
them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes;
sufficient for themselves, for many days, and
sufficient for all his countrymen for about eight
days time; and wistiing them a good voyage, I
saw them go, agreeing with them about a signal
they should hang out at their return, by which I
sliould know them again, when they came back,
at a distance, before they came on sliore. They
went away with a fair gale on the day that the
moon was at full by my account, in the month of
October; but as for an exact reckoning of days,
after I had once lost it I could never recover it
again; nor had I kept even the number of years,
so punctually, as to be sure I was right, though
as it proved, when I afterwards examined my
account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of
years.
. ( It was no less than eight days I had waited for
them, when a strange and unforeseen accident in-
tervened, of which the like has not perhaps been
beard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch
,oi)e morning, when my man Friday came running
into
in to me, and called aloud, "Master, master they arc
come they are come." I jumped up, and regardless
of danger, I went out as soon as I could get my
cloaths on, through my little grove, which by the
way was by this time grown to be a very thick
wood, I fay, regardless of danger, I went without my
arms, which was not my custom to do: but I was
surprized, when turning my eyes to the sea, * I
presently saw a boat at about a league and a half's
distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder
of mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in; also I observed
presently, that they did not come from that side
which the shore lay on, but from the southermost
end of the island: upon this, I called Friday in,
and bad him lie close, for these were not the peo-
ple we looked for, and that we might not know
yet whether they were friends or enemies. In the
next place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass,
to fee what I could make of them: and having
takeji the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of
the hill, as I used to do, when I was apprehensive^
of any thing, and to take my view the plainer,
without being discovered. I had scarce set my
foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly discover-
ed a (hip tying at an anchor, at about two leagues
and an half s distance from me S. S. E. but not
above a league and an half from the stiore. By
my observation, it appeared plainly to be an En-
glish-
glish ship, and the boat appeared to be an English
long boat,
I cam not express the confusion I was in,
though the joy of seeing a ship, and one that I
had reason to believe was^. manned by my own
countrymen, and consequently friends, was such
as I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret
doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from whence
they came, bidding me keep upon my guard. In
the first place, it occurred to me to consider what
business an English ship could have in that part of
the world, since it was not the way to or from any
part of the world wrhere the English had any traf -
sick; and I knew there had been no storms to drive
them in there as in distress; and that if they were
English really, it was most probable that they were
here upon no good design; and that I had better con-
tinue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves
and murderers.
, Let no man despise the secret hints and notices
of danger which sometimes are given him, when
he may think there is no possibility T>f its being-
real: that such hints and notices are given us, I
believe few that have made any observations of
things can deny; that they are certain discoveries
of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we
cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems
to
to be to warn us of danger, why should we not
suppose they are from some friendly agent, whether,
supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the
question, and that they are given for our good.
v The present question abundantly confirms me iri
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been made
cautious by this secret admonition, come it from
whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and
in a far worse condition than before, as you will fee
presently. I had not kept myself long in this
posture, but I saw the boat draw near the shore,
as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at for the
convenience of landing; however, as they did not
come quite far enough, they did not fee the little
inlet where I formerly landed my rafts; but run
their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a
mile from me, which was very happy for me; for
otherwise they would have landed just as I may fay
at my door, and would soon have beaten me out of
my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I
had. When they were on shore, I was fully satis-
fied they were Englishmen; at least most of them;
one or two I thought were Dutch; but it did not
prove so: there were in all eleven men, whereof
three of them I found were unarmed, and as I
thought bound; and when the first four or five of them
were jumped on shore, they took those three out of
the boat as prisoners: one of the three I could per-
ceive
eeiveufingthe most passionate gestures of entreaty, af-
fliction and despair, even to a kind of extravagance ^
the other two I could perceive lifted up their hands
sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but
not to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly
confounded at the sight, and knew not what the
meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me
in English as well as he could, cc O master! You
fee English mans eat prisoner as well as savage
mans." Why fays I, <c Friday, do you think they
are a going to eat them? "Yes" lays Friday,
i( they will eat them." "No, no," lays I, Friday,
<( I am afraid they will murther them indeed, bat
you may be sure they will not eat them."
All this while, I had no thought of what the
matter really was \ but stood trembling with the
horror of the sight, expecting every moment when
the three prisoners should be killed j nay, once I
law one of the villains lift up his arm with a great
cutlash, as the seamen call it, or sword to strike
one of the poor men; and I expected to lee him
fall every moment, at which all the blood in my
body seemed to i\m chill in my veins.
I wished heartily now for my Spaniard and the
savage, that was gone with him, or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of
them, that I might have rescued the three men,
for
4
ADVENTURES OF
for I saw no fire arms they had among them; bur
it fell out to my mind another way>
after I had observed the outrageous usage of
the three men; by the insolent seamen I observed
the fellows run scattering about the land, as if they
wanted to fee the country; I observed that the
three other men had liberty to go also where they
pleased; but they sat down all three upon the
ground, very pensive; and looked like men in
despair. This put. me in mind of the first time
I came on shore and began to look about me, how
I gave myself over for lost: how wildly I looked
round me; what dreadful apprehensions I had;
and how I lodged in the tree all night, for fear of
being devoured by wild beasts *
As I knew nothing that night of the supply
I was to receive by the providential driving c>f the
ship nearer the land, by the storms and tide, by
which I have since been so long nouriflied and
supported; so these three poor desolate men knew
nothing how certain of deliverance and supply
they were* how near it was to them, and how
effectually and really they were in a condition of
safety, at the same time that they thought them-
selves lost, and their cafe desperate. So little do>
we lee before us in the world, and so much reason
have we to depend chearfully upon the great ma-
ker
ker of the world, that, he does not leave his crea-
tures, so absolutely destitute, but in the worst
circumstances, they have always something to be
thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deli-
verance than they imagine, nay, are even brought
to their deliverance by the means by which they
seem to be brought to their destruction.
It was just at the top of high water when these
people came on shore, and partly while they stood
parlying with the prisoners they brought, and partly
while they rambled about to fee what kind of a
place they were in, they had carelessly staid till
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed con-
siderably away> leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as
I found afterwards, having drank a little too
much brandy, fell a-fleep; however one of them
waking a little sooner than the other, and finding
die boat too fast a-ground for him to stir it, holoo-
ed for the rest who were straggling about, upon
which they all soon came to the boat; but it was
past all their strength to launch her, the% boat being
very heavy, and the sliore on that side being a soft
ouly land, almost like a quick sand. In this con-
dition like true seamen, who are perhaps the least of
all mankind given to forethought, they gave it
over, and away they strolled about the country
D d again*
again; and I heard one of thfem say aloud id
another, calling them off from the boat, "Why
let her alone Jack, cannot yon, she will float
next tide 5" by which I was stilly confirmed in
the mean enquiry, of what countrymen they were.
All this \vhile I kept myself very close, riot
once daring to stir out of my castle, any farther
than to my place of observation, near the
top of the hill; and very glkd I was to think
how well it was fortified: I knew it was no
less than ten hours before thfe boat could float
•again, and by that time it would be dark, and
I might be at more liberty to fee their motions
and to hear theif difcourle, if they had any. In
the mean time, I fitted myself tip for k battle,
as before, though with more caution, knowing I
had to do with ariother kind of enemy then I
had at first; I ordered Friday also, who I had
made an excellent marks-rtian with his gun to
load himself with arms, I took myself two
"fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets;
my figure indeed was very fierce; I had my for-
midable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I
have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two
pistols in my belt,- and a gun upon each shoul-
der.
It was my design as I said above, not to have
made ariy attempt till it was dark: but about two
a clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in
5 short
short they were all] gone straggling into the woods
and as I thought laid down to sleep. The three
poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition
to get any sleep, were however fat down under the
shelter of great tree,, at about a quarter of a mile
from me, and as I thought out of fight of any of
the rest. Upon this I resolved to discover myself
to them, and learn something of their condition;
immediately I marched in the figure as above, my
man Friday at a good distance behind me, as for-
midable for his arms as I, but not making quite
so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as
near them undiscovered as I could, and then be-
fore any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in
Spanish, "What are ye, gentlemen?" They
started up at the noise, but were ten times more
confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure that I made. They made no answer at
all, but I thought I perceived them just going
to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English,
Gentlemen, said I, "do not be surprized at me*
perhaps you may have a friend near you, when
you did not expect it. He must be sent directly
from heaven then," laid one of them very gravely
to me, and pulling off his hat at the fame time
to me, "for our condition is past the help of
man. All help is from heaven, sir, said I: But
can you put a stranger in the way how to help
you, for you seem to be in some great distress?
I saw you, when you landed, and when you
D d 2 seemed
ADVENTURES OF
teemed to make applications to the brutes that
came with you, I saw ^one of them lift up hk
sword to kill you,"
The poor man, with tears runing down his
face, and trembling,, looking like one astonished,,
returned, "Ami talking to God or man! Is it
a real man or an angel? Be in no fear about
that, Sir* said I, if God had sent an angel to
relieve you, he would have come better cloadied,
and armed after another manner than you see
me; pray lay aside your fears,, I am a man, an
"Englishman, and diipofed to assist you, you fee;
I have one servant * only; we have arms and
ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve you?—
What is your cafe?"
- Our, cafe said he, sir, is too long to teil
you, while our murtherers are so near us; but
in short, sir, I was commander of that ship,
my men have mutinied against me; they have
been hardly prevailed on not to murther me,
and at last have set me on snore in this desolate
place, with these * two men with me, one my
mate, the other a passenger, where we expected
to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited,
arid know not yet what to think of it."
"Where are these brutes your enemies, said
I, do you know where they are gone? There
they lie, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of
4 trees;
tt-rees; Cf my heart trembles for fear they have
seen us, and heard you speak; if they have they
"will certainly murther us all. Had they
any fire arms said I. He answered, they
had only two pieces, one of which they left
in the boat. <c Well then, said I, leave the rest
to me; I see they are all asleep, it is an easy
thing to kill them all; but shall we rather .take
them prisoners?" He todd me there wjere two
desperate villains among them, that it was scarce
safe to shew any mercy to, but if they wrere se-
cured, he believed all the rest would retyrin to
their duty., I asked him which they ^were? He
told me 'he could not as that distance distinguish
them, .but he would .obey my orders in any thing
I would direct. "Well, fays I, let us retreat
out of their view or hearing, lest they awake,
and we will resolve further:" So they willingly
^went back with me, till the woods .covered us
from them.
"Look, yoy, sir, said I, is I venture upon
your deliverance/ are you willing to make two
conditions with me. He anticipated my proposals,
<by telling me, that both he and the ship, if reco-
vered, should be wholly directed and command
«ed by me in everything; and if the flb^p was not re-
covered, he would live and die v/ith me in what
part of the world soever I would send him; and
D d 3 the
the two other men said the same. "Well, says
I, my conditions are but two; i, That while
you stay in this illand with me, you will not
pretend to any authority here, and if I put
arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions,
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me
or mine upon this island, and in the mean time
be governed by my orders. 2. That if the sliip
is, or may be recovered, you will carry me and
my man to England passage free."
He gave me all the assurances that the invention
and faith of man could devise, that he would
comply with these most reasonable demands, and
besides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all occasions as long as he lived. f< Well
then, said I, here are three muskets for you,
with powder and ball j tell me next what you
think is proper to be done," He shewed all
the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able,
biit offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him
I thought it was hard venturing any thing, but
the best method I could think ot was to fire
upon them at once, as they lay, and if any was
not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit,
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon
God's providence to direct the shot.
Hs
He said very modestly, that he was loth to.
kill them if he could help it, but that those two.
were incorrigible villains, and had been the au-,
thors. of all die mutiny in the ship, and if they
escaped we should be undone still, for they would
go on board and bring the whose ship's com-
pany, and destroy iis all. " Well then, fays I,
necessity legitimates my advice, far it is the only,
way to save oyr lives." However seeing him
still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they
should go themselves, and manage as they fpund
convenient.
In .the middle pf this discourse we heard some
of them awake, and soon after we saw two of
theip on their feet; I asked him if either pf them
were of the men who he had said were the heads
of the mutiny? He said, " no. Well then, said
I, you may let them escape, and providence ieems
tq have awakened them on purpose to save them-
selves: jkw j| fays I, if the rest efcapg you it is
your fault." Animated with this, he took the
musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol
in his belt, and his two comrades with him with
each man a piece in his hand: the two men who
were with him, going first, made some noise, at
which one of the seamen, who was awake, turn-
ed about, and seeing them coming, cried out to
the rest; but it was too late then, for the mq-
D d 4 ment
408 ApyEJTTUR]E? Q?
ment he cried out, they fired, I mean the twq>
men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece j
they had so well aimed their shot at the men
they knew, than one of them was killed on the
spot, the other very much wounded, but not being
dead, he started up on his feet, arid called eager-
ly for help to the other, but the captain step-
ping to Kim told him it was too late to cry
for'help, he- should call upon God to forgive
his villany: and with that word knocked him
down with the stock of his musket, so that he
never spoke more: there were three more in th$
company, and one of them* was also slightly
wounded. By this time I was come, and when
they saw1 their danger, and that it was in vain
to resist, they begged for mercy: the captain told
them, he would spare their lives, if they would
give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the
treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear
to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and
afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came. They gave him all the pro-
testations of their sincerity that could be desired
arid he was willing to believe them, and spare
their lives, which I was not .against only that I
obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot
while they were on the island.
While
409
While this was doing I sent Friday with the
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure
her, and bring away the oars and fails, which
they did, and by and by three straggling men
that were (happily for them) parted from the
rest came back upon hearing the guns fired, and
seeing the captain, who before was their prisoner,
now their conqueror, they submitted to be
Jbound also and so our victory was complete.
It now remained that the captain and I should
enquire into one another's circumstances: I began
jfirst, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement: and
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition: and
indeed, as my story is a whole collection of
wonders, it affected him deeply; but when he
reflected from thence upon himself, and how I
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose
to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and
he could not speak a word more. After this
communication was at an end, I carried him and
his two men into my appartment, leading them
in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the
house, where I refreshed them with such provisions
as I had, and shewed them all the contrivances
I had made, during my long, long inhabiting in
that place.:
All
All I shewed them, all I. said to them,.wa$
perfectly amazing; but above all the captain ad-,
mired my fortification, and. how perfectly . I had
concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which
having been now planted near twenty years, and
the trees growing much faster than jn England
was . become, a little wood, and so thick that it
was impassable in any part of it, but. at that one
fide; where I had reserved my little winding
passage into it: I told him this was my castle
and my residence, but that I had a feat in the
country, as most princes have, whither I could
retreat upon occasion, and I would shew him
that too another time, but at present our business
was to consider how to recover the ship: he agre-
ed with, me as to that but told me, he was per-
fectly at a loss what measures to take, for that
there were still six and twenty hands on board,
who having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by
which they had all, forfeited their lives to the
law, would be hardned in it now by desper-
ation, and would carry it on, knowing that if
they were reduced they would be brought to the
gallows,, as soon as they came to England, or to
any of the English, colonies; and that therefore
there would be no attacking them with so small
# number as we were.
I MUSED
I mused for some time upon what he had said-
and found it was a very rational conclusion, and
that therefore something was to be resolved on
very speedily, as well to draw the men on board
into some snare for their surprize, as to prevent
their landing upon us, and destroying us: upon
this it presently .occured to me, that in a little
while the ship's crew, wondering what was become
of their comrades,: and of the boat, would cer-
tainly come on shore in their other boat to fee
for them, and that, then perhaps they might come
armed and be too strong for us; this he allow-
ed to be rational. Upon this I told him, the
first thing we had to do was to stave the boat,
which lay upon the beach, so that they might
not carry her off; and taking every thing out of
her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to
swimaccordingly we went on board, took the
arms which was left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bot-
tle of brandy and another of rum, a few biscuit
cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of
sugar in a piece of canvas; the sugar was fivq
dr six pounds all which was very welcome to me,
elpecially the brandy and sugar, of which I had
none lest for many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore,
(die. oars, mast, fail and rudder of the boat were
carried
carried away before as above) we knocked a great
hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong
enough to master us, yet they could not carry
off the boat. Indeed it was not much in my
thoughts that we could be able to recover the
ship; but my view was, that if they went away
without the boat, I did not much question to
make her fit again" to carry us to the Leeward
Islands, and call upon our friends, the Spaniards,
in my way, for I had them .still in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs,
and had first by main strength heaved the boat
upon the beach, so high that the tide would not
fleet her off at high-water mark, and besides
had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be
quickly stopped, and were set down musing what
we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and
law her making a waft with her antient, as a
signal for the boat to come on board; but no
boat stirred; and they fired levefal times making
other signals for the boat. At last, when all their
signals and siring proved fruitless, and they found
the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help
of my glasses, hoist another boat out and row to-
wards the shore and we found, as they ap-
proached, that there were no less than ten men
in her, and that they had fire arms with them.
As
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the
stiore, we had a full view of them as they came
and a plain sight of the men even of their-faces,
because the tide having set .them' a little to the
east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore
to come to the same place where the other had
landed and where the boat lay. By this means
I fay, we had a full view of them, and the captain
knew the persons and characters of all the men
in the boat, of whom, .he said, that there were
three very honest fellows, who he was sure were
led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-
powered and frighted. But that as for the boat-
swain, who, it seems, was the chief officer among
them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous
as any of the ship's crew, and were no doubt'
made desperate in their new enterprize; and ter-
ribly apprehensive he was that they would be too
powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him,
that men in our circumstances were past the op-
eration of fear j that seeing almost every condition
that could be, was better than that which we
were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that
the consequence, whether death or life, would be
sure to be a deliverance: I asked him what he
thought of the circumstances of my life, and
whether a deliverance were not worth venturing
for ?" And where, sir/ said I3 is your belief of
my being preserved here on purpose to five your
'life
ADVENTURES OF
life, which elevated you a little while ago? For
my part, said I, there leems to me. but one thing
amiss in all the prospect of it. What's that? fays
he. Why, said I, it is, that as these are three or
four honest fellows among them which should be
spared; had they been all of the wicked part of
crew, I should have thought God's providence
had singled them out to deliver them into your
hands! for depend upon it, every man that comes
ashore are our own, and shall die or live as they
behave to us." As I spoke this with a raised
voice and chearful countenance, I found it greatly
encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our
business.
We had, upon the first appearance of the
boat's coming from the ship, considered of se-
parating our prisoners, and we had indeed secur-
ed them effectually. Two of them, of whom the
captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent with
/Friday, and one of the three (delivered men) to
my cave, where they were remote enough, and
out of danger of being heard or discovered, or
of finding their way out of the woods, if they
could have delivered themselves; here they left
them bound, but gave them provisions, and pro-
mised them if they contined there quietly to give
them their liberty in a day or two; but that if
they attempted their escape, they should be put
to
to death Without mercy. They promised faith-
fully to bear their confinement with patience,
. and were very thankful that they had such good
usage, as to have provisions and light left them,
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made
ourselves) for their comfort; and they did not
know but that he stood sentinel over them at the
entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage; two of
them were kept pinioned indeed because the cap-
tain "was not free to trust them; but the other
two were taken into my service upon their cap-
tain's recommendation, and upon their solemnly
'engaging to live and die with us; so with them
and the three honest men, we were seven- men,
well airmed; and I made no doubt we should
4>e Sable to deal well enough with the ten that
wdre a coming,'considering that the captain had
Yaid there were three or four honest men among
"them also. A'S soon as they got to the place
where their other boat lay, they run their boat
into the beach, and came all on shore, haling
the boat up after them, which I was glad to fee;
for I was afraid they would rather have kft the
boat at an anchor, some distance from the shore,
with some hands in her, to guard her; and so we
should not be able to seize the boat. Being- on
shore* the first thing they \ did, they ran all to
their
ADVENTURES OF
their other boat, and it was easy to see they were
under a great surprize, to find her stripped as
above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in
her bottom.
After they had mused a while upon this, they
let up two or diree great shouts ho! loing with
all their might, to try if they could make their
companions hear; but all was to no purpose;
then they came all close in a ring, and fired a
volley of their small arms, whichindeed we heard,
and the echoes made the woods, ring; but it
was all one, those in the cave we were lure could
not hear, and those in our keeping though they
heard it well enough yet durst give no answer to
them. They were so astonished at the surprize
of this, that as they told us afterwards, they re-
solved to go all on board again to their stiip,
and let them know, that the men were all mur-
theredand the, long-boat staved -y accordingly they
immediately launched their boat again, and got
all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even
confounded at this, believeing they would go on
board the ship again, and set fail, giving their
comrades for lost, and so he should still lose the
sl^ip, which he was in hopes we should have re-
covered j
covered; but he was quickly as much frighted
the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat;
but we perceived them all coming on shore
again j but with this new measure in their con-
duct, which it seems they consulted together upon
viz. To leave three men in the boat, and the
rest to go on sliore, and go up into the country
to look for their fellows. This was a great dis-
appointment to us; for now we were at a great
loss what to do: for our seizing those seven men
on shore would be no advantage to us, if we
let the boat escape j because they would then
row away to the sliip, and then the rest of them
Would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so, our
recovering the sliip would be lost.
However, we had rio remedy, but to ^ait arid
see what the issue of things might present $ the
seven men came on shore, and the three who re-
mained in the boat, put her off to a good dis-
tance from the shore, and came to an anchor
to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us
to come at them in the boat. Those that came
on shore* kept close together, marching towards
the top of the little hill, under which my habi-
tation lay 3 and we could fee them plainly; thoi!gh
they could not perceive us: we^Could have been
E e very
ADVENTURES, O P
very glad they would have come nearer to iis^
so that we might have fired at them, or that
they would have gone farther off, that we might
have come abroad. But when they were come
to the brow of the hill, where they could see a
great way into the valleys and woods, Which lay
towards the north east part* and where the island
lay lowest, they shouted and ho! loed, till they
were weary, and not caring it seems to venture
far from the shore, nor far from one another^
they sat down together under a tree, to consider
of it: had they thought fit to have gone to sleep
'therfcj as the other part of them had done, they
had done the jobb for us; but they Were too full
of apprehensions of danger, to venture to go to
sleep, though they could not tell what the danger
Was they had to fear neither;
The captain made a very just proposal to me
iipoti this consultation os theirs, viz. That perhaps
they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour
to make their fellows hear,. and that we sliould
all sally upon them, just at the juncture
When their pieces were all discharged, and they
would certainly yield, and we should have them
Without blood shed: I liked this proposal, pro-
vided it was done while we were near enough to
come up to them* before they could load their
pieces again. But this event did not happen, and
we
419
we lay still a long time, very irresolute what
course to take; at length I told them, there
Would be nothing to be done in my opinion till
night, and then if they did not return to the boat,
perhaps we might find a way to get between them
and the shore, and so might use some stratagem
with them in the boat to get them on shore.
We Waited a great while though very impatient
for their removing; and were very uneasy* when
after long consultations, we saw them all start up,
and march down towards the sea: it seems they
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them, of
the danger of the place* that they resolved to go
on board the ship again, give their companions
bvef for lost, and so go on with their intended
voyage with the ship.
As soon as I perceived them to go towards
the shore, I imagined it to be as it really was,
that they had given over their search, and were
for going back again* and the captain, as soon as
1 told him my thoughts, was ready to fink at the
apprehensions of it: but I presently thought of a
stratagem to fetch them back again; and which
answered my end to a tittle. I ordered Friday
and the captain's mate, to go over the little creek
west-ward, towards the place where the savages
came on shore, when Friday, was rescued; and
as soon as they came to a little rising ground,
E e z at;
at about half a mile distance, I bad them cry
ho! loe, as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the seamen heahl them; that as soon a£
ever they heard the seamen answer them, they
.should return It again, and then keeping out of
sight, take £ round always answering when the
others ho! loed, to draw them as far into the
ifland, and among the woods, as possible and then
Wheel about again to me, by such ways as I di-
rected them*
Th£y were jiist going into the boat, when
Friday and the mate ho! loed, and they present-
ly heard them, and answering, run along the
shore westward towards the voice they heard, when
they were presently stopped by the creek, where the
water being up, they could not get over, and
called for the boat to come up, and set them
over, as indeed I expected. When they had set
themselves ovier; I observed; that the boat being
gone up a good way into the creek, and as it
Were, in a harbour Within .the land, they took
one of the three men out of her to go along with
them, and left only two in the boat, having fas-
tened her to the stump of ± little tree on the
fhofe.
This was what I wished for; and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to theif
business
j took the rest with me, and crossing the creek
out of their sight, we surprized the two men be-
fore they were aware; one of them lying on th^
stiore, and the other being in the boat; the fel-
low on shore, was between sleeping and wakings
and going to start up, the captain who was fore-
most, ran in upon him, and knocked him down^
and then called out to him in the boat to yield,
or he was a dead man. There needed very few
arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when
he saw fiye men upon hirn^ and his comrade
knocked down; besides, this was it seems one of
the three who were not so heartily in the mu-
tiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was
easily persuaded not only to yield, but after-
wards to join very sincere with us. In the mean
time, Friday and the captain's mate so well ma-
naged their business with the rest, that they drew
them by ho! loing and answering, from one hill
to another, and from one wood to another, tilj
they not only heartily tired them, but left them
\yhere they were very sure they could not reach
back to the boat, before it was dark $ and indeed
they were heartily tired themselves ^lso by the
time they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do, but to watch for
them, in the dark and to fall upon thern^ sp as to
make sure work with them.
E e 3 It
It was several hours after Friday came back tq
me, before they came back to their boat; and we
could hear the foremost of them long before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along, and could also hear them answer, and
complain how lame and tired they were, and nos
able tq come any faster, which was very welcome
news to us. At length they came up to the boat;
but it is impossible to express their confusion, when
they found the boat fast a-ground in the creek, the
tide ebbed out, and their two men gone: we
could hear them call to one another in a most
lamentable manner, telling one another, they
were gotten into an enchanted island; that either
there were inhabitants in it, and they should be
all murthered, or else there were devils and spirits
in it, and they should be all carried away, and
devoured. They ho! loed again, and called their
two comrades by their names, a great many times:
but no answer. After some time, we could see them
by the little light there was, run about ^ringing
their hands like men in despair, and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest them-
selves j then come all "ore again, and walk about
3gain, and so over the same thing again. My
men would fain have had me given them leave to
fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was
willing to take them at some advantage so to ij?ar$
them* and kill as few of them as I cpuld; and,
especially
especially I was unwilling to hazard tljie killing of
any of our men? knowing the other were very welj
armed. I resolved to wait to see if they did not
leparate; and therefore to make sure of them, I
drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday
i and the captain, to creep upon their hands and
feet as close to the ground a$ they could, that they
might not be discovered, and get as near them as
they could possibly, before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, but
jthat the boatswain, who was the principal ringlead-
er of the mutiny, and had now shewn himself the
most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came
walking towards them with'two more of the
crew ; the captain was so eager, at having this prin-
cipal rogue so much in his power? that he could
hardly have patience to let him come so near, as to
be sure of him; for they only heard his tongue ber
fore; but whe$ they came nearer, the captain and
Friday starting up on their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot, the
next man was stiot into the body, and fell just by'
him, though he did not die till an hour or two
after j and the third run for it. At the noise of
the fire, I immediately advanced with my whole
army, which was now eight men, viz. myself
Generalissimo, Friday my lieutenant general, the
E e 4 captain
ADVENTURES OF
captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of
war, whom we had trusted \yith arms
We came upon them indeed in the dark, sq
that they could not see our number and I made
the man they had left in the boat, who was now
one of us, call to them by name, to try if I could
bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps re-
cluce them to terms, which fell out just as we
desired: for indeed it was easy to think, as their
condition then was, they wquld be very willing to
capitulate, so he calls out as loud as he could, to
pne of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith; Tom
femith answered immediately, who is that, Robin-
Ion y for it seems he knew his voice: the other
answered, "Ay, ay j for God sake, Tom Smith,
throw down your arms, and yield, or you are all
dead men this moment. Who must: we yield to;
where are they? Says Smith again. IHtere they
are, fays he, here's our captain, and fifty men
with him, have been hunting you this two hours:
the boatswain is killed, Will Fry is wounded,
and I am a prisoner 3 and if you do not yield, you
are all lost. Will they give us quarter then, (fays
Tom Smith) and we will yield? I will go afl<^
if you promise to yield," says Robinson; so he
asked the captain, and the captain then calls him-
self out, you Smith you know my voice, if you
•'-' ;W
425
lay down your arms immediately,*and submit, you
stiall have your lives all but Will Atkins,
Upon this, "Will Atkins cried out, for Gods
sjake captain, give me quarter, what haye I done?
They have been all as bad as I," which by the
way, was nQt true neither, for it seems this Will
Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the cap-
tain, when they first mutinied, and used him bar-
barously, in tying his hands, and giving him
injurious language. However, the captain told
him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and
trust to the governor's mercy, by which he meant
me; for they all called me governor. In a word,
they all laid down their arms, and begged their
lives $ and I sent the man that had parlied with
them, and two more who bound them all: and
then my great army of fifty men, which particular-
ly with those three, were all but eight, came up
and seized upon them all, and upon their boat,
only that I kept myself and one more, out of sight,
for reaspns of state,
Our pext work was to repair the bo^t, and
think of seizing the ship and as for the captain
H0)V he l>ad leisure to parley with them: he ex-
- postulated with them upon the villany of their
practices with him, and at length upon the far-
ther wickedness of their design, and how certainly
it
ADVENTURES OF
it must bring them to misery and distress in the*
end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged
hard for their lives; as for that, he told them,
they were none of his prisoners, but the command-
er's of the island, that they thought they had set
him on shore in a barren uninhabited island, but it
had pleased God so to direct them, that the island
was inhabited, and that the governor was an En-
glishman; that he might hang them all there, if
he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter,
he supposed he would send them to England to be
deak with there, as justice required, except Atkins,
whom he was commanded by the governor to
advise to prepare for death.; for that he would be
hanged in the morning.
Though this was all but a fiction of his own,
yet it had its desired effect; Atkins fell upon his
knees, to beg the captain to intercede with the
governor for his life: and all the rest begged of him
for God's fake, that they might not be sent to
England,
It now occurred to me, that the time of our de-
liverance was come, and that it would be a most
easy thing, to bring these fellows in, to be hearty
in getting possession of the ships so I retired in the
dark
5
dark from them, that they might not see what kind
of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me; when I called as at a good distance, one of the
men was ordered to {peak again, and fay to the
captain, captain, the commander calls for youj
and presently the captain replied, Tell his excel-
lency I am just a-coming. This more perfectly
amused them, and they all believed that the
commander was just by with his fifty men. Up-
on the captain's coming to me, I told him my pro-
ject for seizing the ship, which he liked wonder-
fully wejl, and resolved to put it in execution the
next morning. But in order to execute it with
more art, and secure of success, I told him we
must divide the prisoners, and that he must go and
take Atkins and two more of the worst of them,
and fend them pinioned to the cave where the others
lay: This was committed to Friday and the two
men who came on shore with the captain. They
conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison, and
it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition. The other I ordered to my
bower, as I called it, of which I have given
a full description; and as it was fenced in, and
they pinioned, the place was secure enough, con-
sidering they were upon their behaviour.
To those in the morning I sent the captain, who
jvas to enter into a parley with them, in a word to
try
try them, and tell me whether he thought they
might me trusted or no to go on board and surprize
the ship. He talked to them of the injury done
him, of the condition they were brought to, and
that though the governor had given them quarter
for their lives, as to the present action, yet that
if they were sent to England they would all be
hanged in chains to be sure; but that if they would
join in so just an attempt as to recover the sliip,
he would have the governor's engagement for their
pardon,
Any qne may guess hpw readily such a pro-
posal would be accepted by men in their condition $
they fell down on theif knees to the captain, and
promised, with the deepest imprecations, that
they would be faithful tp hirp tb the last drop?
and that they should owe their lives to him, and
would go with him alj over the world, that they
would own him for a father to them q.s long a$
they lived. "Well, fays the captain, I must go
and tell the governor what you fay, and fee what
I can do to bring him to consent to it So he
brought me an account of the temper he found
them in, and that he verily believed they woukj
be faithful.
However, that v/e might be very secure, I
told him he should go back again and chuse om
t^ese
these five, and tell them, that they might see he
Bid riot v(rant men, that he toould take out these
five to be his assistants, and that the governor
iTOuld keep thfc other two, and thfe three that
were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave) as
hostages for the fidelity of those five, and that if
they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five
hostages sliould be hanged in chains alive on
the fhorb.
This looked severe, and convinced them that
the governor was in earnest: however they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now
the business of the prisoners, as much as of the
captain, to persuade the other five to do their
duty;
Our ftrength was now thus ordered for the
expedition: i. The captain his mate and passen-
ger. 2. Then the two prisoners of the first gang^
to whom, having their characters from the Captain,
I had given their liberty, and trusted them
with arms. 3. The other two that I had kept
till now ih my bower, pinioned 5 but upon the
captain's motion, had released. 4. These five
released at last; so that they were twelve in all,
besides five we kept prisoners in the cave {ot
hostages;
I asked the captain if he was willing to ven-
ture
Advenf u res o P
ture with these hands on board the ship; for as
for me and my man Friday, I did not think it
was proper for us to stir, having seven men Jest
behind; and it was employment enough for us to
keep them asunder, arid supply them with victu-
als. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep
them fast^ but Friday went in twice a day to them
to supply them with necfessaries; and I made the
other two carry provisions to a certain distance,
where Friday was to take it.
When I shewed myself to the two hostages,
it was with the captain, who told them I was the
person the governor had ordered to look after
them; and that it was the goverhor's pleasure they
should not stir any where but by my direction,
and if they did they would be fetched into the
castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never
suffered them to see me as governor, so I now
appeared as another person, and spoke of the go-
vernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, up-
on all occasions.
The captain how had nb difficulty before him^
but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of
one, and man them: he made his passenger cap-
tain of one, with four other men; and himself
and his mate, and five more, went in the other:
and they contrived their business very well, for
the
they came up to the ship about midnight. As
soon as they came within call of the ship, he
made Robinson hale them, and tell them they
had brought off the men and the boat, but that
it was a long time before they had found them,
and the like; holding them in a chat till they
Came to the ship's side; when the captain and the
mate entering first with their arms, immediately
knocked down the second mate and carpenter
•With the butt end of their muskets, being very
faithfully seconded by their men; they secured
all the rest that were upon the main and quarter
decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep
them down that were below, when the other boat
and their men entering at the fore-chains, secured
the fore-castle of the ship, and the scuttle which
went down into the cook room, making three
men they found there prisoners. When this was
done, and all safe upon deck, the captain order-
ed the mate with three men to break into the round
house where the new rebel captain lay, and having
taken the alarm, had gotton up, and with two men
and a boy had gotten fire-arms in their hands;
and when the mate with a crow split open the
door, the new captain and his men fired boldly
among them* and wounded the mate with a mus-
ket-ball, which broke his arm, and wounded twro
more of the men, but killed no body. The mate
calling for help, rushed however into the round-
house,
house, wounded as he was,- and with his pistol
ihot the new captain through the head, the bul-
let entering at his mouth, and came out agairi
behind one of his ears^, so that he never spoke a
word more: upon which the rest yielded, and the
sliip was taken effectually^ without any more
lives lost;
As soon as the ship wa$ thus secured the cap-
tain ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the
signal agreed upon with me to give me notice
of his success; which you may be sure I was very
glad to heary having fat watching upon the shore
for it till near two of the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down y and it having been a day of great fatigue
to me, I slept very found, till I was something
surprized with the noise of a gun, and presently
starting up, I heard a, man call me by the name
of Governor, Governor, and presently I knew the
captain's voice: when clirtibing up to the top of the
hill, there he stood, and pointing to the sliip, he
embraced me in his arms,- " my dear friend and
deliverer, fays he, there's your ship, for Ihe is all
yours, and so are we and all that belong to her/'
1 cast my eyes to the {hip, and there she rode
within a little more than half a mile of the Ihore,-
for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they
were masters of her, and the weather being fair,
had
had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of the little creek, and the tide being up,
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the
place where I at first landed my rafts, and so
landed just at my door. I was at first ready to
sink down with the surprize: for I saw my de-
liverance indeed visibly put into my hands, all
things eafy, and a large ship just ready to carry
me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for
some time, I was not able to answer him one
word, but as he had taken me in his arms, I
held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the
ground. He perceived the surprize, and imme-
diately pulls a bottle out of his pocket and gave
me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on
purpose for me; after I had drank it I sat down
upon the ground; and though it brought me to
myself, yet it was a good while before I could
speak a word to him. All this time the poor
man was in as great an extasy as I, only not
under any surprize, as I was; and he said a thou-^
sand kind tender things to me, to compose me
and bring me to myself: but such was the flood
of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into
confusion $ at last it broke out into tears; and in
a little while after I recovered my speech: then
I took my turn and embraced him as my de-
liverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him I
looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to
F f deliver
ADVENTURES OF
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seem6
ed to be a chain of wonders j that such things
as these were the testimonies we had of a secret
hand of providence governing the world, and an
evidence that the eye of an infinite power could
search into the remotest corner of the world, and
aud send help to. the miserable whenever he
pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thank-
fulness to heaven, and what heart could forbear to
bless him, who had not only in a miraculous manner
provided for me in such a wilderness, and in such
a desolate condition, but from whom every de-
liverance must always be acknowledged to pro-
ceed.
Wpien we had talked a while, the captain told
me he had brought me some little refreshment,
such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches
that had been so long his master had not plunder-
ed him of: upon this he called aloud to the
boat, and bad his men bring the things ashore
that were for the governnor; and indeed it was a
present, as if I had been one, not that was to be
carried away along with them, but as if I had
been to dwell upon the island still, and they
'Were to go without me.. First.he had brought
me a case of. bottles full of excellent cordial
waters
435
waters, fix large bottles of Madeira wine, the
bottles held two quarts apiece, two pound of ex-
cellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the
. ship's beef, and fix pieces of pork, with a bag
of pease, and above a hundred weight of biscuit;
he also brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour
a box full of lemons, and two bottles of lime
juice, and abundance of other things: but besides
these, and what was a thousand times more useful
to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, six
very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair
of siloes^ a hat and one pair of stockings, with a
very good suit of cloaths of his own which had
been worn but very little -y in a word he cloathed me
from head to foot. It was a very kind and a-
greeable present, as any one may imagine, to one in
my circumstances; but never was any thing in the
world of that kind so unpleasant, aukward and un-
easy as it was to me to wear such cloaths at their
first putting on.
After these ceremonies past* and after all his
good things were brought into my little apart-
ment we began to consult what was to be done
with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con-
sidering, whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, especially two of them whom
he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
last degree i and the captain said, he knew they
F f 2 were:
such rogues that there was no obliging cherry
and if he did carry them away, it must be in ,
irons, as malefactors to be delivered over to jus-
tice at the first English colony he could come at;
and I found that the captain himself was very
anxious about it. Upon this I told him, that if
he desired it, I would undertake to bring the
two men he spoke of, to make it their own re-
quest that he should leave them upon the island.
I should be very glad of that, says the captain,
with all my heart. Well, fays I, I will fend for
them up, and talk with them for you; so I
caused Friday and the two hostages for they were
now discharged, their comrades having perform-
ed their promise, I say, I caused them to go to
the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they
were, to the bower, and keep them there till I
came. After some time I came thither dressed
in my new habit, and now I was called gover-
nor again: being all met, and the captain witfy
me, I caus ed the men to be brought before me, and I
told them I had had a full account of their villanous
behavour to the captain,- and how they had run
gway with the ship, and were preparing to coin-
mit farther robberies but that providence had en-
snared them in their own ways, and that they
were fallen into the pit which they had dug for
others. I let them know, that by my direction
the ship had been seized, that she lay now in the
i road,
road, and they might sec by and by that their new
captain had received the reward of his villany, for
that they might fee him hanging at the yard arm:
that as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to lay, why I should not execute them as
pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission
they could not doubt but I had authority so to
do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest
that they had nothing to say but this, that when
they were taken the captain promised them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy; but
I told them, iC I knew not what mercy to shew
themfor as for myself, I had resolved to quit
the island with all my men, and had taken pas-
sage with the captain to go for England: and as
for the captain, he could not carry them to Eng-
land other than as prisoners, in irons, to be tri-
ed for mutiny, and running away with the ship
. the consequence of which, they must needs know
would be the gallows -9 so that I could not tell
what was best for them, unless they had a mind
to take their fate in the island; if they desired
that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it,
I had some inclination to give them their lives,
if they thought they could shift on sliore.
They seemed very thankful for it, and said
F f 3 ^ they
they would much rather venture to stay here than
to be carried to England to be hanged: so I left
it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some
difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them
there: upon this I seemed a little angry with the
captain, and told him that they were my pri-
soners, not his; and that feeing I had offered
them so much favour, I would be as good as my
word, and that if he did not think fit to consent
to it, I would set them at liberty, as I found
them: and if he did not like it, lie. might take
them again, if he could catch them. Upon this
they appared very thankful, and I accordingly
set them at liberty, and bad them retire into the
woods to the place whence they came, and I
would leave them some fire arms, some ammunition,
and some directions how they should live very
well, if they thought fit. upon this I prepared
to go on board the ship, and told the captain I
would stay that night to prepare my things, and
desired him to go on board in the mean time
and keep all right in the ship, and fend
the boat on shore next day for me ordering
him, in the mean time to cause the new captain
who was killed to be hanged at the yard arm,
fhat these men might fee him.
Whe^
When the captain was gone, I sent For the
rrie up to me to my apartment, and entered seri-
ously into discourse with them os their circum-
stances; I told them I thought they had made a
right choice, that if the captain carried them away
they would certainly be Hanged: I shewed them
the-new captain, hanging at the yard-arm of the
sliip, and told them they had nothing less to ex-
pect.
When they had all declared their willingness
to stay, I then told them I would let them into
the story of my living there, and put them into the
way of making it easy to them: accordingly I
gave them the whole history of the place, and of
my coming to it 5 shewed them my fortifications,
the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cur-
ed my grapes, and, in a word, all that was ne-
cessary to make them easy: I told them the story
also of the sixteen Spaniards that were to be ex-
pected for whom I left a letter, and made them
promise to treat them in common with them-
selves. Here it may be noted that the captain
had ink on board, who admired greatly that -1
never hit upon a way of making ink of charcoal
and water, or of something else, as I had done
things much harder.
I i*eft them my fire-arm^ viz. five muskets,
F f 4 three
/ 
three fowling-pieces, and three swords: I had
above a barrel and half of powder left, for after
the first year or two I used but little, and wasted .
none:- I gave them a description of the way I
managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese;
in a word, I gave them every part of my own
story, and told them I should prevail with the
captain to, leave them two barrels of gun-powder
more, and some garden feeds, which I told them
I would have been very glapi of: also I gave them
the bag of pease which the captain had brought
me to eat, and bad them be sure to sow and in-
crease them. A
Having done -all this, I left them the next
day, and went on board the ship; we prepared
immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night;
the next morning early two of the five men came
swimming to the ship's fide, and making a most
lamentable complaint* of the other three, begged
to be taken into the ship for God's fake, for they
should be murthered, and begged the captain
to tg,ke them on board, though he hanged them
immediately. Upon this the captain pretended
to have no power without me; but after some
difficulty, and after their solemn promises of a-
mendment; they were. taken on board, and were
some time after soundly whipped and pickled,
after
after which they proved very honest and quiet
fellows.
Some time after this the boat was ordered on
shore, the tide being up, with the things pro-
mised to the men, to which the captain, at my
intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be
added which they took, and were very thankful
for 5 I also encouraged them by telling them that
if it lay in my way to fend any vessel to take
\ them in, 1 would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on
board for reliques, the great goat's skin cap I
had.made, my umbrella, and my old parrot -9 also
I forget not to take the money I formerly men-
tioned, which had lain by me so long useless,
that it was grown rusty, -or tarnished, and could
hardly pass for silver, till it had been a little rub-
bed, and handled; as also the money I found in
the wreck of the Sanifh ship. And thus I
left the ifland, the 19th of December, as I found
by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I
had been upon it eight and twenty years, two
months, and nineteen days; being delivered from
this second captivity, the same day of the month
that I first made my escape in the barcolongo,
from among the Moors of Sallee. In this vessel,
after a long voyage, I arrived in England, the
eleventh
• eleventh of June in the year 1687, having been
thirty and five years absent.
When I came to England 1 was a perfect-
stranger to all 'the world, as if I had been never
known there. , My benefactor and faithful steward
whom I 'had left my money in trust vyith, was
alive; but had had great misfortunes in the world:
was become a widow the second time, and very low in
the world I made her very easy as to what ihe owed
me,assuring her J would give her no trouble; but on
the contrary, in gratitude to her former care and
faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock
would afford, which #t that time would indeed'
allow me to do but little for her; but I assured
her, I would never forget her former kindness
to me; nor did I forget her when I had sufficient
to help her, as shall be observed in its place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother and all the fa-
mily extinct, except that I found two sisters, and 1
two of the children of one of my, brothers; and
as I had been long ago given pVer for dead,
there had been no provision made for me; so that
in a word, I found nothing to relieve, or assist
me; and that little.money I had would not dp
jnuch for me, as to settling in the world,
I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which
I did not expect; and this was, that the masto
of
443
of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered,
and by the same means saved the ship and cargo
having given a very handsome account to the
owners, of the manner how I had saved the lives
of the men and the ship, they invited me to meet
them, and some other merchants concerned, and all
together made me a very handsome compliment up-
on the subject, and a present of almost 200I. sterling.
But aster making several reflections upon the
circumstances of my life, and how little way this
would go towards settling me in * the world, I
resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not
come by some information of the state of my
plantation in the Brasils, and of what was become
of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had
some years now given me over for dead. With
this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I
arrived in April following; my man Friday ac-
companied me very honestly in all these ramblings,
and proving a most faithful servant upon all oc-
casions. When I came to Lisbon I found out
by enquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my
old friend the captain of the ship who first took me
up at sea off of the shore of Africk: He was now
grown old, and had left off going to sea, having
put his son, who was far from a young man, into
his ship, and who still used the Brasil trade; the
oki man did not know me, and indeed I hard-
ly
ADVENTURES OF
knew him; but I soon brought him to my re-
membrance, and as soon brought myself to his
remembrance, when I told him who I was.
.After some passionate expressions of the old
acquaintance between us, 1 enquired after my
plantation and my partner: the old man told me
he had not been in the Brasils for about nine
years, but that he could assure me that when he
came away my partner was living, but the trus-
tees whom I had joined with him, to take cog-
nizance of my part, were both dead; that how-
ever, be believed that I would have a very good
account of the improvement of the plantation,
for that upon the general belief of my being
cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in
the account of the produce of my part of the
plantation to the procurator fiscal, who had ap-
propriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one
third to the King, and two thirds to the monastry
of St. Augustine to be expended for the benefit
of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians
to the catholic faith; but that if I appeared, or
any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it
would ~be restored, only that the improvement or
annual production being distributed to charitable
uses, could not be restored; but he assured me,
that the steward of the kings revenue (from lands)
^nd the proviedore or steward of the monastery,
had
had taken great care all along that the incumbent,
that is to fay my partner, gave every year a
faithful account of the produce, of which they re-
ceived duly my moiety. I asked him if he knew
to what height of improvement he had brought
the plantation, and whether he thought it might
be worth looking after; or whether, on my going
thither, I should meet with no obstruction to my
possessing my just right in the moiety? He told
me he could not tell exactly to what degree the
plantation was improved but this he knew, that
my partner was grown exceeding rich, upon the
enjoying but one half of it, and that to the best
of his remembrance he that heard, that the king's
third of my part, which was it seems granted
away to some other monastery, or religious house,
amounted to above two hundred moidores a year:
that as to my being restored- to a quiet possession
of it, there was no question to be made of that,
my partner being aliv$ to witness my title, and my
name being also enrolled in the register of the
country;; also he told me that the survivors of my
two trustees were very fair honest people, and
very wealthy, and he believed I would not only
have their assistance for putting me in possession,
but would find a very considerable sum of money
in their hands for my account being the produce
of the farm while their fathers held the trust
and
and before it was given up as above, which as he
remembered was for about twelve years.
I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy
at this account, and enquired of the old captain,
how it came to pass that the trustees should thus
dispose of my effects when he knew that I had made
my will, and had made him the Portugueze cap-
tain, my universal heir, &c.
He told me that was true, but that as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as
executor, until some certain account should come
of my death, and that besides, he was not will-
ing to intermeddle with a thing so remote; that
is was true Jie had registered my will, and put
in his claim, and could he have given any account
of my being dead or alive, he would have acted by
procuration, and taken possession of the Ingenio*
so they called the sugar-house, and had given his
son, who was now at the Brasils orders to do it.
<c But fays the old man, I have one piece of
hews to tell you/ which perhaps may not be so
acceptable to you as the rest, and that is, believ-
ing you were lost, and all the world believing
ib also, your partner and trustees did offer to
account with me in your name, for six or eight
of the first years profits which I recieved thereout;
there being at that time, fays he, great disburse-
ments for increasing the works, building an In-
genio,
447
genlo, and buying slaves, it did not amount to
near so much as afterwards it produced: however
fays the old man, I shall give you a true account
of what I have received in all, and how I have
disposed of it. 4
Aeter a few days father conference with this
ancient friend, he brought me an account of the
first six years income of my plantation, signed by
my partner and the merchants trustees, being always
delivered in goods, viz. tobacco in roll and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molosses, &c. which is the
consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this
account, that every year the income considerably
increased; but, as above, the disbursement being
large, the sum at first was small: however, the
old man let me see that he was debtor to me 470
moidores of gold, besides 60 chests of sugar, and
15 double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his
sliip, he having been shipwrecked coming home
to Lisbon about eleven years after my leaving the
place. The good man then began to complain
of his misfortunes, and how he had been obliged
to make use of my money to recover his losses,
and buy him a share in a new sliip -y however,
my* old friend, fays, he, you shall not want a sup-
ply in your necessity, and as soon as my son re-
turns you shall be fully satisfied* Upon that he
pulls out an old pouch, and gives me 160 Por-
tugal
ADVENTURES OF
tugal moidores in gold • and gave me the writing
of his title to the sliip, which his son was gone to
the Brasils in, of which he was a quarter part
owner, and .his son another, he puts them both in-
to my hands, for security of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and
kindness of the poor man to be able to bear this;
and remember what he had done for me, how he
had taken me up at sea, and how generously he
had. used me on all occasions, and particularly,
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he said to me;
therefore, first I asked him if his circumstances
admitted him to spare so much money at that
time, and if it would not straiten him? He told
me, he could not say but it might straiten him a
little, but however it was my money, and I might
want it more than he.
Every tiring the good man said was full of
affection, and I could hardly refrain from tears
while he Ipoke; in short, I took one hundred of
the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give
him a receipt for them; then I returned him the
r^st, and told him, If ever I had possession of the
plantation, I would return the other to him also,
as indeed I afterwards did; and that as to the bill
of sale of his part in his Ions ship, I would not
take
/
449
take it by any means, but that if I wanted money,
I found he was honest: enough to pay me, and If I
did' not, but came to receive what he gave me
reason to expect., I would never have a penny
more* from him.
When this was past, the old man began to ask
me, if he should put me into a method to make my
claim to my plantation? I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself: he said, I might do it if I
pleased, but that if I did not, there were ways ,e-
nough to secure my right, and immediately to ap
propriate the profits to nyy use; and as there were
ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go away
to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a public
register, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath
that I was alive, and that I was the fame person
who took up the land for the planting the said,
plantation at first. This being regularly attested
by a notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed
me to fend it with a letter of his writing, to a
merchant of his acquaintance at the place, and
then proposed my staying with him till an account
came of the return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration, for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees the merchants, for whose
G g account
account I went to sea, in which where the follow-
ing particular letters and papers enclosed.
First There was the account current of the
produce of my farm, or plantation, from the year
when their father had balanced with my old Por-
tugal captain, being for six years; the balance
appeared to be 1174 moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years
more while they kept the effects in their hands,
before the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found, which
they called civil death; -and the balance of this,
the value of the plantation increasing, amounted
1019446 crufadoes, being about 3240 moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of Augustin's
account, who had received the profits for above
fourteen years, but not being to account for what
was disposed of to the hospital, very honestly declar-
ed he had 87a moidores not distributed, which he
acknowledged to my account, as to the king's
part, that refunded nothing.
There was letter of my partners congratulat-
ing me very affectionately upon my being alive,
giving me an account how the estate was improved
and what it produced a year, with a particular of
the
the number of squares or acres that it contained,
how planted, how many slaves there were upon it,
and making two and twenty crosses for blessings,
told me he had said so many Ave Marias to thank
the blessed virgin that I was alive: inviting me
very passionately to come over and take pofeffion
of my own; and in the mean time to give him
orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I
did not come myself; concluding with a hearty
tender of his friendship, and that of his family,
and sent me, as a present, seven fine Leopards
(kins, which he had it seems received from Africa,
by some other ship which he had sent thither, and
who it seems had made a better voyage than I:
He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats,
and an hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite
so large as moidores.
By the fame fleet, my two merchants trustees
shipped me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of
tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in
gold.
I might well fay, now indeed, that the latter
end of Job was better than the beginning. It is
impossible to express here the flutterings of my
very heart, when I looked over these letters, and
especially when 1 found all my wealth about me;
for as the Brasil ships come all in fleets, the fame
G g 2 ships
ships which brought my letters, brought my goods;
and the effects where safe in the river before the
letters came to my hand. In a word, 1 turned
pale and grew sick; and had not the old man run
and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden
lurprize of joy had overset nature, and I had died
: upon the spot. Nay, after that, 1 continued very
ill, and was so some hours till a physician being
"sent for, and something of the real cause of my
illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood;
after which, I had relief, and grew well: but I
verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent
given in that manner to the spirits, I should have
died*
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five
thousand pounds sterl. in money, and had an estate,
I might well call it in the Brasils, of above a thou-
sand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in
England. And in a word, I was in a condition
which I scarce knew how to understand, or how
to compose myself, for the enjoyment of it. The
first thing I did, was to recompence my original
benefactor, my good old captain, who had been
first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in
my beginning, and honest to me at the end: I
shewed him all that was sent to me, I told him,
that next to the providence of heaven, which dis-
poses all things, it was owing to him and that it
now
4
now lay on me to reward him, which I would do
an hundred fold: so I first returned to him tb<?
hundred moidores I had received of him; the& I
sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a
general releaie or discharge fox the 470 moidcarea,
which he had acknowledged he owed me, in th£
fullest and firmest manner possible \ after which I
caused a procuration to be drawn, empowering
him to be my receiver of the annual profits of my
plantation, and appointing my partner ter account
with him, and make the returns by the usual fleets
to him in my name and a clause in the end, be-
ing a grant of 100 moidores a year to him, during
his life, out of the effects, and 50 moidores a year
to his son after him, for his life: and thus I re-
quited my old man*
I was now to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with, the estate that
providence had thus put into my hands; and in-*
deed I had more care upon my head now, than I
had in my silent state of life in the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing
but what I wanted: whereas I had now a great
charge upon me, and my business was how to se-
cure it. I had never a cave now to hide my
money in, or a place where it might lie without
lock or key, 'till it grew mouldy and tarnislied
before any' body would meddle with it: on the
G g 3 contrary,
ADVENTURES OF
contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to,
trust with it. My old patron the captain, indeed
was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.
In the next place my interest in the Brasils seemed
to summon me thither, but now I could not tell,
how to think of going thither, 'till I had settled
my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands
behind me. At first I thought of my old friend
the widow, who I knew was honest, and would be
just to me; but then she wa$ in years, and but
poor, and for ought I knew, might be indebted
so that in a word, I had no way but to go back to
England myself, and take my effects with me.
It was some months however before I resolved
upon this; and therefore, as I had rewarded the
old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had
been my former benefactor, so I began to think of
my poor widow,, whose husband had been my first
benefactor, and she while it was in her. power, my
faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing
I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his
correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill,
but to go find her out, and carry her in money an
hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her,
and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her,
(he stiould, if I lived, have a further supply: at
the same time I sent my two sisters in the country,
e.ach of therri an hundred pounds, they being,
though
though not in want, yet not in very good circum-
stances one having been married, and left a
widow 'y and the other having a husband not so
kind to her as he stioyld be. But among all my
relations, or acquaintances, I could not yet pitch
upon one, to whom I durst commit the gross of
my stock, that I might go away to the Brasils,
and leave things safe behind me i and this greatly
perplexed me.
I had once a mind to haye gone to the Brasils,
and have settled myself there; for I was, as it
were, naturalized to the place; but I had some
little scruple in my mind about religion, which
insensibly drew me back, of which I shall fey more
presently. However it was not religion that kept
me from going there for the present; and as I had
made no scruple, ot being openly of the religion os
the country, all the while I was among them, so
neither did I yet; only that now and then having
of late thought more of it, (than formerly) when
I began to regret my having professed myself a
papist, and thought it might not be the best religi-
pn to die with.
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept, me from going to the Brasils, but that
really I did not know with whom to leave my
effects behind me$ so I resolved at last to go jx>
G g 4 England
with it, Where, if I arrived, I concluded I should
tiiake som6 acquaintance, or find some relations that
would be faithful to me 5 and accordingly I pre-
pared to go to England with all my wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going home,
I first, the Brasil fleet being just going away, re-
solved to give answers suitable to the just and faith-
ful account of things I had from thence; and first
to the prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full
of thanks for their just dealings, and the offer of
the 8712 moidores, which were undisposed of,
which I desired might be given 500 to the mona-
stery, and 372 to the poor, as the prior should
direct, desiring the good padres prayers for me,
and the like. I wrote next a letter of thanks to
my two trustees, with all the acknowledgement
that so much justice and honesty called for; as for
sending them any present, they where far above
having any occasion for it. Lastly I wrote to my
partner, acknowledging his industry in the impro-
ving, the plantation, and his integrity increasing the
stock of the works, giving him instructions for his
future government of my part, according to the
powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I
desired him to fend whatever became due to me,,
'till he should hear from me more particularly,
assuring him that it was my intention not only to
cpfne to him., but to settle myself there for the re-
mainder
mainder of my life: to this I added a very hand-
some present of some Italian silks for his wife, and
two daughters, for such the captains son informed
me he had -y with two pieces of fine English broad
cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces
of black bays, and some Flanders lace of a good
value.
Having thus settled my affairs, fold my cargo,
and turned all my effects into bills of exchange,
my next difficulty was which way to go to England:
1 had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet
I had a strange aversion to go to England, by sea at
that time; and though I could give no reason for
it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much,
that though I had once shipped my baggage, in
order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not
once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea,
and this might be some of the reason: but let no
man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts
in cafes of such moment: two of the ships which
I had singled out to go in I mean, more particu-
larly singled out than any other, that is to fay, To
as in one of them to put my things on board, and
in the other to have agreed with the captain, I
fay, two of these ships miscarried, viz. one was
taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away
on
ADVENTURES OF
on *the Start, near Torbay, and all the people?:
drowned, except three; so that in either of those:
vessels I had been made miserable, and in .which,
most it was hard to fay.
Having been thus harraffedln my thoughts,-
my old pilot, to whom I communicated every-
thing, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but
either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over
the bay-of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was
but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and
so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid,
and so all the way. by land through.France.
In a word, I was so. prepossessed against my go-
ing by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that.
I resolved to travel all the way by land,, which, as
I was not in haste, apd did not value the charge.,
was by much the pleasanter way; and to make it
more so, my old captain brought an English
gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, vfhex
was willing, to travel with me $ after which we
picked up two more English merchants also, and
two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to
Paris only, so that in, all there were six of us and
five servants; the two merchants and the two Por-
tugueze contenting themselves with one servant
between two, to . save the charge; and as for me,
I got an English- sailor to travel with me as a
servant
459
servant, besides my man Friday, who was too
much a stranger to be capable of supplying the
place of a servant on the road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon, and our
company being very well mounted and armed, we
made a little troop, whereof they did me the
honour to call me captain, as well because I was
the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and
indeed was the original of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea-
journals, so I shall trouble you now with none of
my land journal j but some adventures that hap-
pened to us in this tedious and difficult journey, I
must not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was
worth observing; but it being the latter part of
the summer, we hastened away, and set out from
Madrid about the middle of October: but when
we came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed
at several towns on the way, with an account that
so much snow was fallen on the French side of the
mountains, that several travellers were obliged to
come back to Pampelona, after having attempted,
at an extreme hazard, to pass on.
When
When we came to Pampelona itself we found
it so indeed i and to me that had been always
fcsed to a hot climate, and indeed to countries
where I could scarce'bear any cloaths on, the cold
was insufferable; nor indeed was it more painful
than it was surprizing, to come but ten days before
out of Old Castile, where the weather was not only
warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind
from the Pyreneari mountains so very keen, so
severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to, endan-
ger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and
toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw
the mountains all covered with snow, and felt
cold weather, which he had never seen before or
felt in his life. To mend the matter, when we
came to Pampelona it continued snowing with so
much violence, and so long, that the people said
winter was come before its time, and the roads
which were difficult before, Were now quite im-
passable -y for, in a word, the snow lay in some
places too thick for us to travel, and being not
hard frozen, as is the cafe in northern countries,
there was no going without being in danger of be-
ing buried alive every step. We stayed no less
than twenty days at Pampelona, when seeing the
winter coming 6n, and no likelihood of its being
better, for it was the severest winter all over
Europe
461
Europe that had been known in the memory of
man. I proposed that we should all go away to
Fonterabia, and there take shipping for Bourdeaux,
which was a very little voyage.
But while I was considering this, there come
in four French gentlemen, who having been flop-
ped on the French fide of the passes, as we were
on the Spanish, had found out a guide., who tra-
versing the country near the head of Languedoc,
had brought them over the mountains by such ways
that they were not much incommoded with the
snow5 or where they met with snow in any quantity,
they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and
their horses. We sent for this guide, who told
us, he would undertake to carry us * the fame
way with no hazard from the snow, provided
we were armed sufficiently to protect, ourselves
from wild beasts; for he said, upon these great
snows, it was frequent tor some wolves to shew
themselves at the foot of the mountains, being
made ravenous for want of food, the ground being
covered with snow: we told him, we were well
enough prepared for such creatures as they were,
if he would insure us from a kind of two-legged
wolves, which we were told' we were in mo&
danger from^ especially on the French side of die
mountains.
* • Hs
He satisfied us that there 'was no danger of
that kind in the way that we were to go j so we re-
adily- agreed to follow him, as did also twelve
other gentlemen with their servants, some French^
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to
go, and were obliged to come back again.
Accordingly we set out from Fampelona^
with our guide, on the 15th of November, and
indeed I was surprised, when instead of going
forward, he came directly back with us on the
seme road that we came from Madrid about
twenty miles whtn being passed two rivers and
come into the plain country, we found ourselves in
a warm climate again; where the country was
pleasant and no snow to be seen; but on a sud-
den, turning to his left, he approached the moun-
tains another way; and though it is true the hills and
precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many
tours, such meanders, and led us by such wind-
ing ways, that we were insensibly passed the
height of the mountains without being much in-
cumbred with the snow; and all on a sudden
he shewed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of
Languedoc and Gascoign, all green and flourish-
ing, though indeed it was at a great distance, and
we had sojne rough way to pass yet.
We
We were a little uneasy, however, when we
sound it snowed one whole day and a night, so
fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be
easy, we should soon be past it all: we found,
indeed, that we began to descend every day, and
to come more north than before: and so depend- -
ing upon our guide, we went on.
It was about two hours, cr a little more be-
fore night when our guide being something be-
fore us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of
:a hollow way adjoining to a. thick wood; two
of the wolves made at the guide, and had he
been far before us, he had been devoured indeed
before we could have helped him; one of them
made an attempt upon his horse, and the other
aimed at himself, which terrified him so that he
had not presence of mind enough to craw his
pistol, but ho! loed and cried out to us for help;
my man Friday being next-me, I bad him ride
tip and fee what was the matter; as soon as
Friday come in sight of the man, he ho! iced
as loud as t'other, G master! O master! but like a
bold fellow rode directly up to the poor man, anJ
with his pistol shot the jvjolf that attacked, hkn
into the head.
IT
A D V HTURES OF
It was happy for the poor man that it was
my man Friday* for he having been used to
that kind of creature in his country, he had no
fear upon him, but went close up to him and
shot him, as above; whereas any other of u&
would have fired at a farther distance, and have
perhaps either missed the wolf or endangered shoot-
ing the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a. bold-
er man than I, and indeed it alarmed all our
company, when with the noise of Friday's pistol
we heard on both fides the dismallest howlings
of wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo
of the mountains, that it was to us as if there
had been a prodigious number of them; and
perhaps indeed there was not such a few as that
we had no cause of apprehensions: however, as
Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had
made an attempt upon the horse, left him imme-
diately and fled without doing him any damage;
but the man indeed was a little hurt, for the
raging creature had attempted him twice, and bit
his leg, and though he made some defence, he
was just as it were tumbling down by the dis-
order of his horse, when Friday came up and shot
the wolf.
It
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of
Friday's pistol we all mended our pace, and rode
up as fast as the way,'which was very difficult,
would give us leave, to fee what was the matter;
as soon as we came clear of the trees, which
blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been
the cafe, and ^iow Friday had disengaged the poor
jguide, though we did not presently discern what
kind of creature it was he had killed.
But never was a fight managed so hardily and
in such a surprizing manner, as that which fol-
lowed between Friday and a bear, which gave
us all, though at first we were surprized and
afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable:
as the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does
not gallop as. the wolf does, who is swift and
light, so he has two* particular qualities .which
generally are the rule of his actions; first, as to
men who are not his proper prey, I fay, not his pro
per prey, because he does not usually attempt them,
except they first attack him, unless he be exces-
sive hungry, which it is probable might now
be his cafe, the ground being covered with snow;
on tlie contrary, if you meet him in the woods,
if you don't meddle- with him j he won't meddle
with you; but then you must take care to be very
civil to him, and give him the road; for when'
he thinks, himself abused, he sets all other busi-
H h ness 
ADVENTURES Of
ness aside to pursue his revenge, and will have
satisfaction in point of honour; this is his first
quality: the next is, if he be once affronted, he
will never leave you, night or day till he has
his revenge, but follows at a good round rate
till he overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him
off from his horse,, for the man was hurt, and
frighted very much; when on a sudden we spied
the bear come ©ut of the wood, and a. vast mon-
strous tine it was, the biggest by far that ever I
saw: we were all a little surprized when we saw
him: but when Friday saw him, it' was easy to
see joy and courage in the fellows counten-
ance; " O ! O! O! lays Friday three times, point
ing to him, O master! you give me te leave!
me stiakee te hand -with him; me make you good
laugh.
I was surprized to see the fellow so * well
pleased; you fool, says I he will eat you up.
Eatee me up! eatee me up! lay Friday, twice
over again, me eatee him up; me make you
good laugh; you all fit here, me show you
good laugh: so down he fits, and gets off his
boots in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps,
(as we. call the fiat shoes they wear, and which,
he
he had in his pocket) gives my other servant
his horse, and with his gun away he flew,, swift
like the wind.
. The bear was walking softly on, and offered
to meddle with no body, till Friday coming pretty
near, calls to him, as if the bear could under-
stand him > cc Hark ye* hark ye, fays Friday,
me speakee wit you. We followed at a dis-
tance; for now being come down on the Gas-
coign side of the mountains, we w;ere entered a
vast great forest; where the country was plain
and pretty open, though it had many trees in it
scattered here and there
Friday who had, as we fay, the heels of the
bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a
great stone, or clod, that he had got under a
tree, and throws it at him arid hit him' just
on the head, but did him no more harm than if
he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered
Friday V end, for the rogue was so , void of fear
that he did it purely to make the bear follow
him> and shew us some laugh, as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him,
he turns about, and Comes after, him, taking dev-1
ilifh long strides* and shuffling along at a strange
rate, so as would have put a horse to a mid-
ding gallop: away runs Friday, and takes his
H h 2 course
ADVENTURES OF
course as if he run towards us for help; so we
all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and
deliver my man, though I was angry, at him
heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, when
he was going about his own business another
way, and especially I was angry that he had
turned the bear upon-us and then run away; and.I
called out,, "You dog, said I, is this your mak-
ing us laugh? Come away and take your horse,
that we may slioot,the creature; he hears me and
cries out, no shoot, no slioot, stand still, and you
get much laugh:" and as the nimble creature
ran two for the beast's one, he turned on a sud-
den, on one side of.us, and seeing a great oak
tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to
follow, and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly
up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground, at about five or fix yards from the butt
of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree,
and we followed at a distance, the first thing
he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it,'but
let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree,
climbing like a cat, though so monstrously heavy;
I was, amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of
my man, and could not for my life fee any
thing to laugh at yet, till, seeing the bear get
up the tree, we all rode nearer to him.
Wnkn
469
When 'we came to the tree, there was Friday
got out to the small end of a large limb os the
tree, and the bear got about half way to him;
as soon as the bear got out to that part where .
the limb of the tree was weaker, "Ha, lays he
to us, now you fee me teachee the bear dance"
so he falls a jumping and shaking the bough,
at which the bear began to,totter, but stood still,
and began to look behind him, to fee how he
should get back, then indeed we did laugh hearti-
ly: but Friday had not done with him by a
great deal: when seeing him stand still he calls
out to him again, as if he had supposed the
bear could speak Englisli. What you come no
farther, pray you come farther; so he left jump-
ing and shaking the tree; and the bear just as if
he understood Englisli, did come a little farther,
then he fell a jumping again, and - the bear stop-
ped again. We thought now was a good time
to knock him in the head, and called to Friday
to standstill, and we should shoot the bear, but
he cried out earnestly, O pray! O pray! no
shoot, me Ihoot by and then; he would have
said, by and by $ however, to shorten the story
, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so
tickilish, that we ,had laughed enough indeed
but still could not imagine what the fellow would
do: for first we thought he depended upon shak-
ing the bear off: and we found the bear was too
H h 3 cunning
ADVENTURES OF
cunning for that too: for he would not go out
too far to be thrown down, biit clings fast with
his great broad claws and feet so that we could
not imagine what would be the end of it, and what,
the jest would be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for
seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that
he would not be persuaded to come any farther; iC
Well, says Friday, you no come farther, me go;
you no come to me, me go come to you/' and
upon this, he goes out to, the smaller end of the
bough' where it would bend with his weight, and
gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the
bough, till he came near enough to jump down
on his feet, and away he run to his gun, he takes
it up, and stands still. Well, said I to him,
Friday, <c what will you do now? why dont you
slioot him? No shoot lays Friday, no yet, me
shoot now, me ho kill; me stay, give you more
laugh;" and indeed so he did, as you will fee
presently? for when the bear saw his enemy gone
he comes back from the bough where he stood;
but did it mighty leisurely, he looked behind
him every step, and coming backward till he got
into the body of the tree; then with the same
hinder end foremost, he came down the tree,
grasping it with his <:laws, and moving one foot
at a time, very leisurely; at this juncture, and
just before he could set his hind foot on the
ground
ground, Friday stept up close to him, clapt the
muzzle of his piece into his ear and shot him
dead. Then the rogue turned about to fee if we
jdid not laugh and when he saw we were pleased
by our looks, he falls a laughing himself very
loud y " so we kill bear if he was in my coun-
try, fays. Friday. So you kill them, fays I, why
you have, no guns; no, fays he, no gun but we
shoot, great much long arrow/' This was indeed
a good diversion to us; but we were still in
a wild place, and our guide hurt, and what to do
we hardly knew: the howling of wolves run
much in my head: and indeed, except the noise
I once heard on the shore of Africa, of which
I have said something already, I never heard
any thing that filled me with so much horror.
These things, and the approach of night,
-palled us off, or else as Friday would have had
us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this
monstrous creature off, which was worth saving:
but we had near three leagues to go, and our
guide hastened us, so we left him, and went for-
ward on our journey
The ground was still covered with snow,
though not so deep and dangerous as on the
mountains, and the ravenous creatures, as we
heard afterwards, were come down into the forest
H h 4 and
and plain country, pressed by hunger to seek for
food j and had done a great deal of mischief in
the villages, where they surprized the country
people, killed a great many of their sheep and
horses, and some people too. We had one dan-
gerous place to pass, which our guide told us,
if there were any more wolves in the country,
we should find them there, and this was in a
small plain, surrounded with woods on every side
and a'long narrow defile or lane, which we were
to pass to get through the wood, and then we
should come to the village where we were to
lodge. It was within/ half an hour of fun set
when we entered the first wood, and a little after
the fun set when we came into the plain : we met
with nothing in the first wood, except, that in a little
plain within the wood, which was not above two
furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross
the road, full speed one after another, as if they
had been in chace of some prey/and had it \n
view; they took no notice of us,, and were gone
out of sight in a few moments. Upon this our
guide,- who by the way was but a faint-hearted
fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture; for he
believed-there were more wolves a coming ,We
kept' our arms ready, and our eyes about us, but
we law no more wolves, till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and
entered the plain, as soon as we came into the
plain we had occasion enough to look about us:
the
the first object we met with, was a dead horse
'that is to fay, a poor horse which the wolves had
killed, and at least a dozen of them %t work; we
could not fay eating of him, but. picking of his
bones rather; for they had eaten up all the
flesh before: we did not think fit to disturb
them at their feast, neither did they take much
/ notice of us: Friday would have let fly at them,
but I would not suffer him by any means; for I
found we were like to have more business upon
our hands than we were aware of. We were not
gone half over the plain, but we began to hear
the wolves howl in the wood on our left, in a
frightful manner, and presently after we saw about
a hundred coming on directly towards us all in a
body, and most of them in a line, as regularly
as an army drawn up by experienced officers. I
scarce knew in what manner to receive them;
but found to draw ourselves in a close line was
the only way.; so we formed in a moment: but
that we might not have too much interval, I
ordered, that only every other man should fire,
and that the others who had not fired should stand
ready to give them a second volley immediately
if they continued to advance upon us, and that
then those who had fired at first, should not
pretend to load their fusees, again but stand ready
with ever}7 one a pistol; for we were all armed
with a fusee, and a pair of pistols each man; fq
we
we were by this method able to fire six volleys
half of us at a time; however, at present we hac}
no necessity; for upon firing the first volley,
the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as
well with the noise, as with the fire; four of them
being shot into the head, dropped, several others
were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we
could fee by the snow; I found they stopped,
but did not immediately retreat; whereupon re-
membring that I had been told, that the fiercest
creatures were terrified at the voice of a man,
I caused all our company to ho! loe as loud as
we could • and I found the notion not altogether,
mistaken; for upon our shout, they began to re -
tire, and turn about; then I ordered a second
. volley to be fired in their rear, which put them
to the gallQp, and away they went to the woods,
Th,is gave us leisure to charge our pieces again,
and that we might loose no time, we kept go-
ing; but we had but little more than loaded our
fusees, and put ourselves into a readiness, whea
we heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on
our left, only that it was farther onward the fame
way we were to .go.
The night was coming on, and the light be-
gan to be dusky, which made it worse on our
side; but the noise encreasing, we could easily
perceive that it was the howling and yelling of
those
\
475
those hellish creatures; and on a sudden, we per-
ceived two or three troops of wolves, one on our
left, one behind us, and one on our front; so
that we seemed to be surrounded with them; how-
ever, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our
way.'forward, as fast as we could make our horses
go, which, the way being very rough, was only a
good large trbt; in this manner we came in view
pf the entrance of a wood, through which we were
to pass, at the farther side of the plain; but we
y/ere greatly surprised, when coming nearer the
lane, or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves
standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at
another opening of the wood,' we heard the noi;se
of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a
horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying
like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves
after him, full speed; indeed the horse had the
heels of them, but as we supposed that he could
not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they
would get up with him at last, and no question
but they did.
But here we had a most horrible sight; for
riding up to the entrance where the horse came
out, we found the' carcase of another horse, and
of two men devoured by the ravenous creatures,
and one of the men was no doubt the fame that
we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by
him
ADVENTURES OF
him fired off; but as to the man, his head and the
upper part of his body was eaten up. This fill-
ed us with horror, and we knew not what course
to take, but the creatures resolved us soon, for
they gathered about us presently, in hopes of
prey; and I verily believe there were three
hundred of them: it happened very much to our
advantage, that at the entrance into the wood,
but a little way from it, there lay some large
timber trees, which had been cut down the sum-
mer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage;
J drew my little troop in among those trees, and
placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree,
I advised them all to alight and keeping that tree
before us for a breast work, to stand in a trian-
gle, or three fronts, inclosing our horses in the
center.
We did so, and it was well we did °, for never
was a more furious charge than the creatures
made upon us in the place; they came on with a.
growling kind of noise (and mounted the piece of
timber,(which as I said, was our breast work) as
'if they were only rustling upon their prey; and this
fury of theirs,, it seems, was principally occasioned
by their seeing our horses behind us, they being
the prey they aimed at; I ordered our men to
fire as before, every other man, and they took
their aim so sure, that they indeed killed several
of
477
os the wolves at the first volley; but there was a
necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came
on like devils, those behind pushing on those
before. ,
. When we had fired the second volley of our
fusees, we thought they stopped" a little, and I
hoped they would have gone off but it was but
a moment, for others came forward again; so we
fired two vollies of our pistols, and I believe in
these four firings we ,had killed ^seventeen or
eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet
they came on ag&in. I was loath to Ipend our
last shot too hastily, so I called my servant, not
my man Friday, for he was better employed, for
with the greatest dexterity imaginable he had
charged my fusee and his own while we were
engaged; but, as I said, I called my other man,
and giving him a horn of powder. I bad him lay
a train all along the piece of timber, and let it
be a large train; he did so, and had but just time
to get away when the wolves came up to it, and
some were got upon it, when 1 snapping an un-
charged pistol close to the powder, set it on sire;
those that were upon the timber were scorched
with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather
jumped in among" us, with the force and fright
of the fire: we dispatched these in an instant, and
the rest were so frighted with the light, which the
5 night
ADVENTURES O P
night, for it was now vety near dark, made more
terrible, that they drew back a little; upon which
I ordered bur last pistol to be fired off in one
volley, and after that we gave a shout: upon this
the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediate-
ly upon hear twenty * lame ones> that we found
struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting them
with our swords* which answered our expectation,
for the crying and howling they made was better
understood by their fellows j so that they all fled
and left us.
We hid, first and last, killed about threescore
os them, and had it been day light we had killed
many more: the field of battle being thus clear-
ed, we made forward again,. for we had still above
half a league to go: we heard the ravenous
creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went*
several times $ and sometimes we fancied we saw
some of them, but the snow dazzling our eyes
we were not certain j so in about an hour more
we came to the town where we were to lodge,'
which we found in a tcfrible fright, and all in
asms 3 for, it seems, that the night before the
wolves and some bears had broke into the village
in the night, and put them in a terrible frights
and they were obliged to keep guard night and
day, but especially in the night, to preserve their
cattle and indeed their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and
his leg swelled so with the rankling of his bites,
that he could go no farther safely; so we were
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to
Tholouse, where we sound a warm climate, a
fruitful pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves,
or any thing like them; but when we told our story
at Tholouse, they told us it was nothing but what
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the
ground -3 but they inquired much what kind of
a guide, we had gotten, who would venture to
bring, us that way in such a severe season, and
told us it were very much we wrerc not all de-
voured. When we told them how we placed
ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they
blamed us exceedingly, and told us, it was fifty
to one but we had been all destroyed $ for it was
the fight of the horses which made the wolves Ib
furious, seeing their prey, and that at other times
they are really afraid of a gun.; but the being' ex-
cessive hungry, and raging on that account, the
eagerness to come at the horses made them sense-
less of danger; and that if we had not by the
continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of
the train of powder, mastered them, it had been
great odds but that we had been torn to pieces;
whereas had we been content to have fat still on
horse-back, and fired as horse-men, they would
not have taken the ho'rses for so much their own
'when

AD1 VENTURES OF
when men were on their backs, as otherwise;
and withal they told us that at last, if we had
stood all together, and left our horses,- they would
have been so eager to have devoured them that
we might have come off safe, especially .having
our fire arms in our hands, and being so many,
In number. For my part, I was never more sen-
sible of danger in my life; for seeing above
three hundred devils come roaring and open
mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to
shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over for
lost; and, as it was, I believe I shall never care
to cross those mountains again; I think I would
much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though
I were sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of
in my passage through France, nothing but what
other travellers have given an account of, with
much more advantage than I can. I travelled
from Tholouse to Paris, and without any- con-
siderable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at
Dover the 14th of January, after having had a
severe cold season to travel in.
I was now come to the center of my travels,
and had in a little time all my new discovered
estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which
I brought
I brought with me having been very currently
paid.
My principal guide and privy counsellor, was
my good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for
the money I had lent her, thought no pains too
much, or care too great, to employ for me*
and I trusted her so entirely with every thing,
that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my
effects; and indeed I was very happy from the
beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted
integrity of this good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my ef-
fects with this woman and feetting out for Lis-
bon, and so to the Brasils; but now another
scruple came in my way, and that was religion;
for as I had entertained some doubts about the
Roman religion even while I was abroad, espe-
cially in my state of solitude so I knew there
was no going to the Brasils for me, much less
going to settle there, unless I resolved to em-
brace the Roman catholic religion, without any
reserve, unless, on the Qther hand, I resolved to
be a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr for
religion, and die in the inquisition; so I resoved
to stay at home, and if L could find means for it,
n to, dispose of my plantation.

ADVENTURES OF
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at
Lisbon, who in return gave me notice, that he
could easily, dispbse of it tjiere > but that if I
thought fit to give him leave he would offer it inmy
name to the two merchants, the survivors of my
trustees, who lived in the Brasils, and fully un-
derstood the value of it, by living just upon the
spot, and who I knew were very rich $ so that
he believeed they would be fond of buying it;
he did not doubt but I should make four or five
thousand pieces of eight the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to
offer it to them, and he did so; and in about
eight months more, the ship being then returned
he sent me an account, that they had accepted the
offer, and had remitted thirty-three thousand
pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon^
to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in
the form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent
it to my old man, who sent me bills of ex-
change for thirty two thousand eight hundred
pieces of eight for the estate, reserving the
payment of a hundred moidores a year to him,
the old man, during his life, and fifty moidores
afterwards to his lom for his life, which I had
promised

promised them, which the plantation was to make
good as a rent charge. And thus 1 have given
the first part of a life of fortune and adventures,
a life of providence's chequer work, and of a
variety which the world will seldom be able to
of sliew the like of; beginning foolishly, but
closing much more happily than at any part it
ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this state of
complicated good fortune, I was past running
any more hazards; and so indeed I had been if
other circumstances had concurred, but I was in-
ured to a wandering life, had no family, not
many relations, nor, however rich, had I con-
tracted much acquainance; and though I had
fold my estate in the Brasils, yet I could not keep
the country out of my head, and had a great
mind to be on the wing again, especially I
could not resist the strong inclination I had to
see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards
were in being there, and how the rogues I had
left there used them.
My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuad-
ed me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that
for almost seven years Ihe prevented my running
abroad during which time I took my two ne-
 ,' 3 phews,
ADVENTURES OF
phews, the children of one of my brothers, into
my care: the eldest having something of his own,
I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a set-
lement of some addition to his estate, after my
decease; the other I put out to a captain of a ship,
and after five years, finding him a sensible, bold
enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good
strip, and sent him to sea, and this young fellow
afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther
adventures myself.
In the mean time, I in part settled myself
here; for first of all I married, and that not either
to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had
three children, two sons and one daughter, but
my wife dying, and my nephew coming home
with good success from a voyage to Spain, my
inclination to go abroad, and his importunity
prevailed, and engaged me to go in his ship
as a private trader, to the East-Indies: this was in
the year 1694.
In this voyage I visited my new colony in the
ifland, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the
whole story of their lives, and of the villains I
left there, how at first they insulted the poor
Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed
united and separated; of all which, and how I
supplied

remarkable occurrences that happened during the
ten following years of my life, as well as in my
and return home, you have a true, faithful and
exact narrative in the second part of my adven-
tures, &c.
