Robinson at Home
ROBINSON CRUSOE was a lad who lived
on the coast of England, in the busy city
of York. It was here that he learned to love
the sea.
Robinson had well-to-do parents and a good
home. There was no reason why he should
not have been a contented boy.
His father sent him to school and wished
him to become a lawyer when he grew up.
But Robinson did not wish to become a lawyer.
He did not care for his books. He loved only
the sea and a life of adventure.
Day by day he watched the ships, like great
white birds, sail into the harbor. He wondered
from what lands they came.
He watched them sail out, too, down the
quiet river to the sea, and he wondered to what
lands they were going, and what kinds of peo-
ple were to be met there.
He would say, "Sometime I, too, will sail
away on a ship. I shall learn what is beyond."
7
Indeed, nothing seemed so grand to him as
to be a sailor. He wanted to go away on one
of those white-winged ships and visit the coun-
tries of the great round world.
All through his boyhood days Robinson
kept dreaming of a life of adventure.
When he was sixteen years old, his desire
for the sea grew so strong that he begged his
father to let him go.
His father was saddened by this, but he talked
to Robinson kindly. He tried to discourage
the idea.
"My son," he said, "a sailor's life is one of
danger and hardship. I know, for I have tried
it. The sea is perilous.
"I wish you would listen to what I tell you
and save yourself much suffering. I have plen-
ty of money and, if you will stay at home, I
will set you up in a business of your own.
Then some day you will be glad you did not
take up a roving life."
"Father," said Robinson, "I want to be a
sailor. I want to see strange lands."

8
"Your brothers felt much the same way,"
answered his father with a sigh.
"The oldest went to war and was killed. The
second ran away and has never been heard
from since. Do you not think they often wished
themselves safe at home? Be a good son, my
lad, and obey your parents."
"It is too quiet here for me," Robinson re-
plied. "I am certain that I will have to go some
day. But I will try to stay a while longer."
Robinson's father had to be satisfied with
this answer from his son.
Robinson waited a year. Then he said to
his mother, "I wish you would beg Father to
let me make just one voyage. Then I might
be willing to stay at home ever after."
His mother also refused, and begged him
not to leave his home.
Then Robinson tried truly to forget his
longing for the sea. But every time he saw a
ship go out, he thought of the lands he wished
so much to visit.
Robinson Goes to Sea
One day, when he was about eighteen, Rob-
inson met a friend who was ready to start on
a long voyage with his father, a shipmaster.
"Come with us," urged the lad. "Father will
let you work your way."
Robinson knew that, if he went home to ask
the consent of his parents, they would not let
him go. So he did a very cruel thing. He ran
away to sea without telling them he was going.
When Robinson set out on his first voyage,
he was happy and excited. The very first night
he was on the ship, however, the wind was
stiff and the sea was rough. The motion of
the waves made him ill. He was afraid to
move in his berth. He thought there must be
a dreadful storm and that the ship would
surely go to the bottom.
The next morning he said to the sailors,
"My, what a storm we had last night! I was
sure we were all going to be lost."
How the sailors laughed at him!
10
"That was no storm!" they said. "That was
only a little blow. Just wait till a storm does
come. Then you'll find out the difference."
A few days later a furious storm did arise.
The ship rocked and rolled as if it would tip
over any minute. Huge waves dashed against
its sides, and great sheets of water broke over
its decks. The howling wind drove the ship
now here, now there. The captain and the
sailors were pale with fear, for they thought
they never would reach shore alive.
They cut away the masts to ease the vessel
from the fury of the wind. But it was all to
no purpose. There was so much water in the
ship that the sailors had to work the pumps as
fast as they could to keep it from sinking.
At last the unfortunate vessel began to leak.
Before it sank, however, the crew managed to
escape in a lifeboat.
After being tossed about by the wind and
the waves, the lifeboat finally reached the shore
without the loss of any of the men.
Thus ended Robinson Crusoe's first voyage.
11
Robinson did not feel quite so anxious to
be a sailor after this experience. He wanted
very much to return home. Indeed, he would
have gone home, but he had a foolish fear of
being laughed at by his playmates and the
neighbors. So, instead, he went to London.
Here he remained a few weeks and managed
to get some money by writing to relatives.
In London he became acquainted with the
sailing master of a ship which traded along
the coast of Africa. When the shipmaster
was about to sail, he invited Robinson to make
the voyage with him. He also advised Robin-
son to invest what money he had in trinkets
to trade off to the natives for gold dust.
The captain was very kind to Robinson.
During the voyage he taught him many things
which every sailor should know about the sail-
ing of a vessel.
This voyage was very successful, for Robin-
son came back with a nice sum in gold dust
in exchange for the trinkets which he had
taken with him.
12
He decided that from this time on he would
be a sea trader.
During the next several years Robinson
Crusoe had many strange adventures.
At one time the ship he was on was cap-
tured by pirates, and he was held prisoner for
a long time. Finally, however, he made his
escape, and after a while he went to South
America. Here he decided to buy a plantation
and settle down.
He remained in South America more than
three years and prospered greatly. He might
have become a rich and happy man if he had
not yielded to his old roving desires.
This is the way it happened. Some of the
neighboring planters, or farmers, in the coun-
try came to visit him.
"We do not have enough slaves to till our
land," they said. "We cannot raise our crops
without more workers. NOWT we have a plan,
but we want you to help to carry it out."
"What is your plan?" asked Robinson.
"We will fit out a ship," they said, "and we
13
want you to go to Africa and bring back a
number of big, strong workers."
"I have left the sea for good," replied Robin-
son. "I do not wish to go."
The planters begged Robinson Crusoe until
at last he agreed to make the voyage.
14
Robinson Is Shipwrecked
After the vessel had been at sea for several
days, a storm arose. The wind blew so fierce-
ly that the captain could not steer the vessel
at all. He could only let it go in whatever di-
rection the wind drove it.
For twelve days the storm raged with such
fury that the poor sailors expected every min-
ute to be swallowed up by the sea.
At the end of that time, they sighted land
and hoped that they might be saved. Then the
wind drove the poor ship upon a sand bar and
threatened to break it to pieces. The frightened
sailors lowered the lifeboat and tried to reach
the shore.
A lifeboat could not live in that raging sea,
however. The great waves were so high that
they seemed like mountains. They beat down
upon the lifeboat and sank it. Everybody on the
boat, except Robinson Crusoe, was drowned.
Robinson, too, would have been drowned
had not a great wave carried him into shallow
15
water. Then a strange thing happened. The
next wave lifted and carried him nearer shore.
At last Robinson found himself out of the
water. He got up and ran before another wave
could overtake him. Soon he was safe on some
rocks, and sat down to get his breath.
At first Robinson Crusoe could think of
nothing but his joy at being saved. Then he
began to look around for his comrades. Some
of their clothing had been washed ashore, but
no one was to be seen.
Robinson knew that he alone of all the ship's
company had escaped. Oh, how sad and lone-
ly he felt!
When Robinson looked out at the sea, he
saw the ship still afloat. It was so far away
that he wondered how he had ever reached the
shore alive. Then he began to look about to
see in what sort of place he had landed, and
what was to be done next.
Everywhere were sand and rocks. Robinson
Crusoe could find no food to eat and no fresh
water to drink.
16
He cried to himself, "Now I shall die of
hunger or be eaten by wild beasts. Oh, why
did I not drown with my companions? It
would have been better than being left alone
in a place like this!"
It was beginning to get dark, and Robinson
was afraid of wild beasts, for he had nothing
with which to defend himself.
"I must get some sleep," he thought. "I am
afraid to sleep on the ground; so I suppose I
must roost in a tree like the birds."
Robinson went a little farther back from the
shore, where he found a spring of water. He
took a hearty drink; then he climbed up into
a bushy tree and soon was fast asleep. As
Robinson was very tired from battling the
waves, he slept soundly until morning.
When he waked, the storm was over.
17
Robinson Visits the Ship
As soon as Robinson awoke, he looked for
the ship. He was joyous to see that the tide
had brought it much nearer to shore. It seemed
to be standing almost upright in shallow water,
probably not more than a mile out.
Shortly after noon, Robinson found that the
sea had become very calm.
When the tide had gone out, he saw that
the vessel was not more than a quarter of a
mile from land.
"Alas," he cried, as he looked at the lonely
wreck, "we might all have been saved had we
but stayed on board the ship! Then we could
have built a new ship and sailed away again.
How can I ever live here all alone?"
The tears rolled down Robinson's cheeks
and, for a time, he sat in great despair.
Finally, he said to himself, "I am hungry,
and I need many things. It will do no good
to sit here and weep. I must get aboard the
ship and see what I can find."
18
Robinson walked over the sand and through
shallow water. Then he swam the remainder
of the way. He soon reached the wrecked ves-
sel. When he came to its side, however, he
found no way to get aboard.
He swam twice around the ship, and at last
discovered a small piece of rope hanging from
a chain over the side. He caught hold of this
rope and pulled himself up on the deck.
Robinson had no sooner climbed over the
edge of the vessel than the ship's dog rushed
toward him, wild with joy at sight of him.
Then two cats came out of the cabin. These
cats and the dog were the only living things
that had stayed on board.
Robinson knew there was no time to lose,
for the tide would soon flow in again. He be-
gan to collect the things he most needed.
By this time he was very hungry; so he filled
his pockets with biscuits and ate as he worked.
First, he found several pieces of boards. He
tied a rope around each piece, and threw the
pieces over the side of the ship.
20
When the boards were all in the water, he
fastened them together and made a sort of raft
on which to carry his things ashore.
He then began to load his raft with supplies
he thought he would need most. First, he let
down three chests, in one, of which he had put
food. There were bread, rice, cheese, some
dried goat's flesh, and a little corn.
While Robinson was loading his raft, the
tide began to flow, and he saw his coat float
away from the spot on the sand where he had
left it.
This gave him the idea of searching for
some clothes. He found plenty, but now took
only those he needed most.
"There are other things," he said, "more im-
portant this time. I shall surely need tools
with which to work."
At last he found a carpenter's chest and put
it upon the raft, for tools were likely to be
more useful to him than gold.
Next, he got some powder and bullets. Then
he added two guns, two pistols, and some rusty
21
swords which he found in the cabin. He
added, also, two extra barrels of dry powder.
By this time the load was very heavy, and
Robinson began to wonder how he would get
to shore with it. Luckily, a strong tide was
rising, and a gentle wind was blowing toward
the land. Robinson knew that both would help
him along. He had found two broken oars
which he could use in getting started.
After several narrow escapes, Robinson
brought his cargo near to the shore. He stuck
a broken oar in the ground on each side of the
raft to anchor it. When the tide ebbed a few
hours later, he and all his treasures were safe
on dry land.
The dog and the two cats had come with
him, and Robinson was very glad to have their
company.
22
When Robinson had made sure that his raft
was safe, he began to look around him in a puz-
zled sort of way. You can imagine that anyone
would feel puzzled after being shipwrecked
near an unknown land. One could have no
idea of what might happen.
"I am going to see what I can find out about
this strange country before I do anything
else," Robinson Crusoe said to himself. "There
may be wild beasts here. There may be savage
people who will try to kill me. I must know
what to expect. Then, too, I must find a place
to build a home."
He took a small pistol, another gun, and some
powder and shot and started to explore.
There was a high hill some distance back
from the shore. When Robinson had climbed
to the top of this hill, he could see for miles
in every direction.
What do you suppose he found?
tie found that he was on an island. On
28
every side he could see nothing but the ocean.
Poor Robinson felt very sad, indeed, for he
knew that he would have to stay here always
unless a ship should pass and its crew happen
to see him.
"I shall die here. I know I shall!" he cried
mournfully. "My poor father was right when
he spoke of the dangers of a sailor's life. I
truly wish I had stayed at home." However,
he felt better when he could find no signs of
wild beasts or of people living on the island.
After looking around for a while, Robinson
returned to the shore. On his way, he killed a
great bird that looked like a hawk. This was,
no doubt, the first time a gun had ever been
fired on the island. At the sound of the shot,
large flocks of birds arose from all parts of
the wood, but they soon settled back again.
Robinson spent the rest of the day carrying
things from the raft.
That night, he made a little hut with the
boards and chests he had brought ashore. In
this hut he slept soundly until morning.
24
The next morning Robinson Crusoe made
another visit to the ship. He left the raft on
the shore because it was heavy. It would have
taken a long time to get it to the vessel. He
made a lighter raft and loaded it less heavily.
Robinson loaded the light raft with a large
quantity of nails and spikes, a jackscrew, a
dozen or more hatchets, and a grindstone to
keep his tools sharp. This time he took all the
clothes that he could find. He also took a large
sail, a hammock, and some bedding.
When this raft was loaded, he quickly took
it to shore.
With the sail and some poles which he had
cut, Robinson made a small tent. He carried
into this tent everything that could have been
spoiled by sun or rain.
He spread some of the bedding on the
ground. Then he put the chests in a circle
around the tent to keep prowlers away. He
placed some boards in such positions that the
door of the tent could easily be blocked from
the inside.
25
Now he felt quite safe and comfortable.
When Robinson saw how useful the sail was,
he went back to the ship and got other sails,
and the ropes that had been used for rigging.
After this he went back and forth many
times, bringing away everything for which he
thought he might have use. He even gathered
up the large rope cables and many bits of the
wooden parts of the ship.
A storm came up as he was on his twelfth
trip, and Robinson had to hurry. He took only
what he was able to carry with him. Among
the things he took were some razors, a pair of
scissors, table knives and forks, and a good
sum of money in gold coins. He afterward
found all these articles very useful.
All the following night the wind blew very
hard, but Robinson lay safe in his tent.
In the morning, when he looked out, the ship
could not be seen. It had sunk to the bottom
of the sea.
26
Life on the Island
After the storm the place where Robinson
had put up his tent was too low and wet.
"This will never do," he said. "I must look
around for a better place in which to live.
First, it must be on higher ground. Next, it
must be near fresh water. Then it must be
sheltered from the sun. Most of all, it must
be near the sea so that I may watch for ships."
At last Robinson chose a level spot beside
a hill for his home.
Back of it was a big wall of rock, hollowed
out somewhat like a cave. Ahead was a
grassy space that sloped down to the sea.
Before Robinson put up his tent, he drove
a double row of stakes in a large half-circle
before the rock. The stakes were about five
and a half feet high. Then he laid the pieces
of heavy cable in layers, one upon the other,
between the stakes until he had a strong fence.
He made no gate. Instead, he built a ladder
which he could pull over the fence after him.
27
When his fence was built, Robinson said,
"I am sure anyone would have a hard time
getting in here."
This was true, for his barricade was strong.
It was a big task to move all his food,
powder, and other stores. It was especially
difficult to get them up his ladder and over
the fence. At last, however, he finished the work.
Robinson put up two tents this time, a large
one and a small one. He used the large tent
to protect his treasures, and the small one as
a room in which to live. Indeed, the two
tents were like a double tent. The large one
was built over the small one. In the little
tent, or room, he hung the hammock he had
brought from the ship. The dog and the cats
lived with him.
Now what, of all Robinson's possessions,
do you imagine he valued most?
It was his powder. Can you guess why?
His powder was the only means he had of
protecting himself from enemies and of pro-
viding himself with food.
28
One night, after he had everything in or-
der, there was a dreadful storm. The lightning
flashed, and the thunder roared.
Robinson Crusoe was greatly frightened.
• i. -.•
He thought of what a terrible thing it would
be if lightning should strike the powder.
As soon as the storm cleared, he divided his
barrels of powder into about a hundred pack-
ages. He placed the packages at various dis-
tances apart so that, whatever happened, some .,
of the powder would be safe.
Robinson worked hard every day. When
he grew tired of work, he took his gun and
roamed about the island to see if he could find
anything to eat.
The first time he went out, he saw a num-
ber of goats grazing in a valley. At first, they
were so wild he could not get near enough
to shoot them. When he climbed to some rocks
above them, however, they did not seem to see
him and were easy targets.
On this trip he killed two goats, which sup-
plied him with meat for many days.
29
As the days went by, Robinson began to
think that he would have to live and die alone
on this desolate spot.
One day he said, "Soon I shall have no way
of knowing how long I have been here, and
I shall lose count of time. What shall I do?"
What do you suppose Robinson did?
He happened to think of a queer way of
making a calendar.
He first set up a great square post, several
feet high, on the seashore near the place where
he had been shipwrecked. Then, near the top
of it, he nailed a large board to form a cross.
Robinson knew that he had been on the
island about ten days. He cut upon the cross-
piece of this post, in large letters, the words:
I CAME ON SHORE HERE ON
THE 30TH OF SEPTEMBER, 1659.
From this time on, he cut a notch on the
post every day. On Sunday he cut a longer
notch to show a week. Then, every thirty
days, he cut a still longer notch for months.
30
•V
-
Among the small things Robinson had
brought from the ship were paper, pens and
ink, and a dial for telling time. He used the
paper and ink sparingly. When they were
gone, he would have no way of writing down
the things that happened to him.
One day Robinson was so discouraged that
he thought he would make a list of all his
troubles. But every time he thought of a
trouble, he also thought of a blessing. He
made these lists of troubles and blessings:
TROUBLES
1.
I am a poor lonely man
on a desert island with
no hope of rescue.
BLESSINGS
1. But I am alive instead of
having been drowned
with my companions.
2. I am singled out and sent
away from all the world
to be unhappy.
3. I am far from all human
society.
4. I am without any means
of defending myself
against man or beast.
5. I have no one to whom I
can talk.
2. But I was also singled out
to be saved from death.
3. But I am not starving in
a barren place where
there is no food.
4. But I am on an island
where I can see no wild
beasts to hurt me.
5. But the ship was sent
near to shore so that I
could get enough things
out of it to supply my
wants.
82
When Robinson was sad, he read over his
list of blessings and found new courage.
For many days after he was cast upon the
island, Robinson Crusoe would go to the top
of the hill each day and watch for a sailboat.
Often he fancied he saw one far, far away,
and he would strain his eyes for hours, only
to see it fade in the distance.
He became too much interested in his work
to watch for ships. He also forgot to be
lonely. He talked to his dog and his cats, and
they were good companions. He talked to
himself, also, just as if he were someone else.
When Robinson had carried all his goods
into his cave, he found he had hardly room
enough to be comfortable. He dug a cellar
back of his house. This cellar was large enough
to hold many of his things.
The digging was very slow, hard work, and
Robinson was glad when the cellar was done.
He next made a rude table and a chair of
the wood brought from the ship. Of course
it took Robinson a long time to do these things,
33
for he did not have the right tools. But he
had, among other things, an adz and some
hatchets, and he made these tools do very well.
He had nothing to do with his time except to
keep busy.
Robinson knocked pieces from the rock that
formed the wall back of his home until he had
made ledges, or flat places, upon which he laid
shelves. Here he kept his guns./£'"'•'•"
When he needed a large board for a shelf,
he had to cut down a tree to make one. This
was very hard work, for he had to cut away
both sides of the tree with his adz and a hatchet
until he had a slab of the right thickness. Then
he had to make the board smooth.
At last everything was in order, and he was
greatly pleased to see what a good home he
had made.
How long do you suppose it had taken Rob-
inson to do all these things?
On looking at his calendar, he discovered
it had taken him nearly a year.
,/ Robinson Longs for Home
When Robinson Crusoe began digging back
into the cave, he found that he needed a shovel,
a pickax, and a wheelbarrow or basket. He
set to work to make them.
He made the shovel from a piece of wood
he cut from a tree called, in South America,
the iron tree, because the wood is so hard.
When it was made, Robinson said, "I am
certain no other man ever worked so long mak-
ing a shovel as I have. But it is a pretty
good shovel, after all."
Robinson heated an old crowbar in the fire
and bent it to make a pickax.
But what about the wheelbarrow?
Robinson believed that he could make that
too, all except the wheel. While he was trying
to think of some way to make a wheel, he
suddenly thought of the hods in which work-
men carry mortar. Then he made a hod in-
stead of a wheelbarrow! It served his purpose
just as well.
35
Robinson Crusoe also was greatly in need
of a candle. Darkness comes before seven
o'clock in some hot countries. He had been
going to bed very early.
"I must find a way," he said to himself, "to
have a light at night. It is dreadful to lie so
long in bed.'V
One day he happened to think of the earthen
lamps which were used in Bible times. Why
couldn't he make one like those?
He baked a little dish of clay in the sun
and filled it with goat's tallow. Next, he made
a lampwick of a strand of rope.
This crude lamp gave him only a dim light,
but it was better than no light at all.
Robinson's chief article of food was goat's
meat. He was glad there were plenty of goats
on the island.
Another food that Robinson liked very much
was turtle meat. The turtles came up on the
shore, and he had no trouble catching them.
He often went fishing, but he was afraid to
eat the fish he caught for he had never seen
36
any like them before. After a time he found
some fish that he was certain were good food.
One day, after Robinson had made himself
quite comfortable and had begun to enjoy this
life, something very exciting occurred.
He was sitting in his cave when the earth
seemed to move and shake. He rushed outside
to see what was happening.
Great waves were rolling up on the shore!
Huge rocks were tumbling into the sea!
After a very short pause the shaking occurred
a second time, and then a third time. Robinson
knew it was an earthquake.
A great storm of wind and rain followed
the earthquake. This continued for about
three hours and did much damage to his home.
It took him many days to repair the damage.
Of course Robinson was dreadfully fright-
ened. However, he was thankful that things
were no worse. He hoped he might never
have another such experience. He resolved
to find a cave in a solid rock where he would
be safe from all danger of earthquakes.
87
One day, not long after the earthquake,
Robinson awoke feeling very ill. He had a
pain in his head. For a time he would burn
with fever; then he would shake with cold. He
knew that he had a tropical fever.
The next day he was better, but on the third
day he was worse again.
There was no one to care for him, and he
felt more sad and helpless than he ever had
felt in his life.
How he wished that he were safe at home
in his own land! There he would have his
mother and kind friends to wait on him. A
good doctor would give him medicine and try
to make him well.
But here in this desolate land what would
become of him?
Often he thought of the words of warning
his father had spoken before he left home.
"Now," he would say to himself, "all that
my dear father told me has come true. I am
far from home, with no one to help me or to
hear me. I might have been happy and pros-
88
perous in my own land, if I had listened to
my parents' advice. But I would not listen
and left home."
Robinson had not prayed for years. Now
he was so sick and wretched that he cried out,
"Lord, help me! I am in great distress!"
After this he felt better. Somehow he be-
lieved that the Lord wanted him to live. Had
He not rescued him from the sea?
The next day Robinson was better but very
weak. He looked for fresh water near by.
On the days that he felt better he sat by the
seashore and looked at all the wonderful things
that God had made. He also prayed every day
and read his Bible. This made him happier.
During all this time he ate very little except
turtle eggs. He drank plenty of fresh water.
After many days of suffering, he began to
feel stronger. In time he became well again.
As long as Robinson stayed on the island,
he resolved to read his Bible and to pray every
day. He resolved, also, to keep Sunday as he
had been taught to do at home.
39
Robinson Explores the Island
When Robinson had grown quite strong
again, he started on a journey to explore more
of the island.
He went up the river into which he had
brought his raft. This he followed until he
came to a place where it was only a little brook,
and where the water was very fresh and sweet.
Along the banks of the brook were plains
covered with grass and many kinds of plants
which he had never seen before.
He looked for cassava root, which people
in hot climates use for making bread, but he
could find none. He was happy to find some
wild sugar cane, however.
Robinson wondered how he could learn
about the plants that grew on the island, for
he believed that in time he must use them for
food or starve.
The next day he went farther. He found
more kinds of trees than he had ever seen be-
fore, and several kinds of fruit.
40
Melons were growing on the ground, and
grapes were hanging from vines which had
climbed to the limbs of trees. The clusters of
grapes looked delicious. Robinson knew it was
not wise, in a warm climate, to eat too much
fruit at one time.
When night came, he climbed up into a tree
and rested well.
The next morning he followed a valley be-
tween the hills until he came to a place that
looked like a planted garden. Near this place
he found cocoa, orange, and lemon trees.
He mixed the juice of lemons with water
and drank the mixture. It tasted very sour.
Robinson took home as many lemons as he
could carry, for he knew that lemons are very
healthful fruit.
He might have moved nearer to these fruit
trees, but they were far from the seashore. So
he often came back to this lovely spot and
stayed several days at a time. He called it his
country home and the other place his seaside
cottage; or castle.
41
For his country home he built a bower of
branches and made a fence of brush. Though
he had seen nothing on the island to harm
him, he feared to sleep without protection.
While here, he hung grapes out in the hot
sun to dry. These dried grapes made delicious
raisins, which he stored away for future use.
Now Robinson had a number of different
kinds of food each day.
For tfreakfast he had raisins.
For dinner, he broiled a piece of goat or
turtle meat.
For supper, he baked two or three turtle
eggs.
He often wished he might have some broth,
but he had no kettle in which to make it.
One day Robinson counted the notches on
his "calendar" and found that there were
three hundred sixty-five. He had been on the
island a year.
Every day he had put down what he had
done and what the weather was like. From
this record he could tell that, instead of cold
42
and warm seasons, the island had wet seasons
and dry seasons.
In fact, there had been two wet seasons and
two dry seasons this first year.
Now that he knew when to expect the rainy
seasons, he provided himself with food so that
he need not go out in the rain for it.
What do you suppose Robinson Crusoe did
on the rainy days? He made things.
When he was a lad, he had liked to go to
a basketmaker's shop. He had liked to watch
the basketmaker weave baskets and other things.
Now, he knew that he could make some bas-
kets for himself, if only he could find some
twigs that would bend but not break.
One day he went to his country home and
cut a large bundle of twigs. These twigs, when
dry, were tough and strong. They did not
break when they were bent.
Robinson carried the twigs to his cave and
made many baskets of different sizes.
He used the baskets to hold his food and to
carry things.
43

Robinson Makes Bread
The first year he lived on the island, Robin-
son Crusoe became a farmer. Does not that
seem a strange thing for a poor, shipwrecked
man to do?
This is how it happened. One day during
a rainy season Robinson noticed some green
stalks springing up near a rock in his door-
yard. These tiny stalks looked like green grain
he had seen growing in his native land. He
watched them grow taller day by day. At last
they formed heads of grain.
This grain was barley. You never could
imagine how overjoyed Robinson was when
he discovered it.
He found some other grain stalks also.
These proved to be rice.
At first Robinson was very much puzzled
as to how the barley and rice had happened to
grow in his yard. Then he remembered that
one of the bags he had brought from the ship
had at one time contained grain.
44
The rats had eaten the grain, except for a
little chaff in the bottom of the bag.
When Robinson had divided his powder
into small packages, he had needed this bag.
He had emptied out the chaff and, from the
grain left in it, these plants had sprung up.
You may be sure that Robinson tended the
grain very carefully. When it was ripe, he
found that he had about twenty heads of bar-
ley and twenty-five or thirty of rice.
"I will save the grain from these crops," he
said. "Then, when the next rainy season
comes, I will sow it. In a few seasons I shall
have enough to supply me with bread."
He did sow his grain. However, the second
harvest yielded only about half a peck each of
barley and of rice. He had not planted the
seeds at the proper time!
When it was time to make the third planting,
Robinson knew that he must prepare a large
piece of ground. He had to dig up the earth
with his heavy ironwood shovel. At last, how-
ever, both the rice and barley were planted.
45
The growing grain had to be watched care-
fully. Goats and other wild creatures lay in
the stalks day and night. They ate many of
the plants down to the ground.
Robinson knew that he must build hedges
about his grain, and that he must do it quickly.
He made hedges of branches from his coun-
try home. Then he set the dog to guard his
fields. The dog chased the animals away dur-
ing the day and barked at them during the
night. This plan worked well.
Soon after the goats were driven away, the
grain began to head.
Now that Robinson was rid of the goats,
the birds began to steal the grain as fast as it
ripened. When he shot at them, they flew
away. As soon as he went into his tent, how-
ever, the thieves were back again.
At last Robinson went out and killed three
of them. These he hung by their feet, for
scarecrows, over the field of grain. The plan
was a great success, for the birds never re-
turned while the scarecrows were there.
46
When at last the grain was ripe, Robinson
wondered how he could cut it. He wished he
had a big sharp knife or a sickle. All that he
could find to help him were two old swords he
had brought from the ship. The swords cut
the grain very well.
His harvest yielded two bushels of barley
and more than two bushels of rice.
When Robinson looked at this fine lot of
grain, he cried, "It is wonderful! Now for a
loaf of bread!"
But how could he make his grain into flour?
How, even if he had flour, could he make it
into dough?
Robinson never before had known how
much work there is in the making of just one
loaf of bread.
First, he had made a spade with which to dig
the ground and make it ready for planting.
He had pulled the heavy bough of a tree over
the ground to smooth the soil. Then he had
sown the seeds.
After his grain had begun to grow, he had
47
driven away the birds and the goats. He had
put hedges around his fields. When the grain
had ripened, he had cut the stalks with swords.
He had pounded the good grain out of the
heads of the stalks and picked up every
kernel.
Now he must find a way to make a mill
with which to grind his grain and a sieve with
which to clean it.
It was again the rainy season, and Robinson
busied himself with making clay dishes in
which to keep his meat and grain. After much
work he had some jars ready to bake in the
sun. The finished vessels were not handsome,
but they would hold dry foods.
What Robinson wanted most of all was
something in which to bake bread. His clay
jars would not stand the fire.
By accident Robinson found a way to make
his jars harder.
One day, after he had broiled his meat for
dinner, he found in the ashes a piece of jar
which had fallen into the fire. The piece had
49
been burned red and was as hard as stone.
Robinson was wild with joy.
"Now," he cried, "I will bake my jars in the
fire instead of by the heat of the sun. Why
didn't I think of this before?"
He made several vessels of wet clay and
placed them over a bed of hot coals. Then he
built a great fire over them and kept it burning
until the jars had baked for five or six hours.
He let the fire go down slowly.
Though some of the jars were broken, there
were two very good ones for use about the fire.
Robinson Crusoe's success with pottery gave
him courage to try to make a mill for grinding
his grain. Since he could not find a very hard
stone on which to grind it, he thought he would
try a block of ironwood.
He cut a piece of this wood into a form
somewhat like that of a bowl. Then he burned
out the center to make it hollow by holding
rods of hot iron against the block and scrap-
ing the burned wood away. Robinson had
seen the Indians in South America burn wood
50
in this manner when they were making canoes.
Robinson made a heavy beater of another
piece of hard wood. He used this to pound
and grind his grain into flour.
Next, he sifted the flour through some thin
muslin shirts to separate it from the bran.
Still Robinson lacked both yeast and an
oven. He knew that very good bread could be
made without yeast. As he had done so well
with his dishes, he thought he would try to
make a clay oven and burn it hard in the fire.
He made an oven which was shaped somewhat
like a deep pan.
Robinson now had everything he needed to
make bread. He put a great many hot coals
upon a large flat stone, which he used for a
hearth. When the stone was heated through,
he brushed the coals from the center and
placed his loaves of bread there. Then he
covered the bread with his oven and heaped
the coals about it. His bread became well
baked and tasty.
Robinson also made puddings of his rice.
51
He longed for a pie, but he had only meat
and raisins for filling.
Three years after his first harvest, Robinson
raised a crop of about forty bushels of grain.
This was enough to supply him with both
bread and seed for planting.
It was useless to raise more grain than was
necessary for his own use, for there was no
one to buy it.
62
Robinson's Pets
During one of the dry seasons, Robinson
set out with his dog to make another journey
about the island.
He found the other side of the island much
nicer than the side on which he lived, though
it did not seem so much like home. He found
out later why it was better for him to live on
the barren side of the island.
On the side of the island which he visited
were lovely hills and valleys. Many beautiful
flowers and fruit trees grew there, and the
woods were filled with birds. On the seashore
were hundreds of turtles and flocks of water-
fowl. Among the rocks and in the valleys were
great numbers of rabbits and goats.
On this trip Robinson secured a parrot.
There were many parrots in the woods, and he
took a young one from the bough of a tree.
On the way home he caught a young kid.
He thought it would be nice to raise a flock of
tame goats.
53
"Someday," he said, "I will have no more
powder with which to kill wild ones. Then I
shall have the tame goats for food."
He made a collar of some rope and led the
kid home.
It was many weeks before the parrot learned
to talk. The first word that Robinson heard
on the island, besides his own speech, was the
word "Poll," spoken by the parrot. You may
be sure this sounded good to the bird's lonely
master.
The young goat soon grew tame and fol-
lowed Robinson about like a dog.
Robinson Crusoe found his new pets good
company.
Whenever Robinson visited the other side
of his island, he thought he could see a speck
of land far off in the distance. He wanted to
go to this far-off island sometime, although it
seemed as far as fifty miles away.
One day he began in earnest to build a boat.
He spent twenty days cutting down a huge
cedar tree.
54
Then he worked nearly six months shaping
the log and hollowing it out like a canoe.
The finished boat was large enough to carry
twenty-six men.
"Someday this canoe will help me to get
away from this island," Robinson thought as
he worked.
Yet that fine boat never carried him away
from the island. Can you guess why?
He could not launch it. He had built it three
hundred feet from the shore, and the land be-
tween it and the water was hilly. The boat
was so heavy he could not budge it an inch.
He lay awake that night thinking how fool-
ish he had been. Why had he not thought
earlier of how his boat was to be launched?
What could he do?
"I know what I will do," he thought the
next morning. "I will bring the water to the
canoe. I will dig a long ditch, or canal,
through which the water can flow. The boat
will then float out into the sea."
Robinson began to dig. As he made the
55
dirt fly, he began to figure out how deep he
would have to make the canal, and how much
earth he would have to throw out before it was
finished.
He figured that it would take one pair of
hands ten or twelve years to build a canal that
would be big enough. Finally, he gave up his
wonderful plan.
When Robinson had time to think it over,
he was glad that he had not been able to put
out to sea in the boat. He wondered if he was
not as happy here on the island as he would
be anywhere else in the world.
"But to be really happy," he thought, "a
person must have someone to live for besides
himself."
56
Robinson Keeps Busy
Robinson Crusoe no longer had the pleasure
of writing down his thoughts and the story
of the things he had done, for his ink was
gone.
His clothing was about worn out, too. He
did not need clothing to keep him warm, but
he did need it to keep off the hot sun.
When his vests had worn out, he had made
several out of some old coats he had brought
from the ship. These looked very queer, for
Robinson was a poor tailor. Still, he could
wear them.
Now that his cloth was about gone, he be-
gan to make garments of the skins of animals
he killed. During all the years he had been on
the island, Robinson had saved and dried skins.
He knew that someday he must use them.
In a country where it rains half the time, one
needs rainy-day clothes.
Robinson did not have a hat, which he
needed very much; so the first thing he made
57
from the skins was a goatskin cap. He put
the hair on the outside to protect him from
the rain. Then he made a coat and a pair of
loose trousers. He left the hair on the outside
of these, also, to keep him dry.
What Robinson thought he would like most
of all was an umbrella to protect him from
the sun as well as from the rain. He could
easily enough make an umbrella that would
shelter him, but he did not know how to make
one that he could close.
By this time Robinson was used to finding
ways of doing things. After several failures
he made of the goatskins a good stout um-
brella. He could both open and close it. This
umbrella was of great use to him.
Thus Robinson lived on day after day.
Twice each year he raised crops of grain
large enough to supply him with bread and
seed. Twice each year, too, he dried raisins.
When Robinson looked at the great boat he
had made, he felt sad. How could he have
been so thoughtless?
58
"Why shouldn't I make a smaller boat in
which to sail around the island?" he thought.
He answered his question by building a
canoe just large enough for his own use. It
took him many months to build it, but he was
proud of it when he had finished. He fitted
it up with a little mast. For a sail he used part
of one he had brought from the wreck.
Robinson then made lockers, or boxes, at
each end of the boat to hold his food and pow-
der. He made a rack on one side to hold his
gun. At the back of the boat he fixed his new
umbrella to keep off the sun.
At last, one day, Robinson set out to sail
around the island. He took with him two doz-
en cakes of barley bread, an earthen pot full
of parched rice, half a roasted goat, a little
bottle of medicine, and a supply of powder
and shot.
He also took two large coats he had brought
from the ship. One was to lie on and the other
to put over him as he slept.
Robinson sailed only halfway around the
59
island, but this was a very dangerous voyage.
Because of tides and swift currents Robinson
had trouble managing the boat. Many times
it was almost overturned. At one time the wind
carried it so far out to sea that Robinson feared
he would never return to his island again.
At last he reached the mouth of a little river
into which he turned the boat.
Robinson was very glad to find that he was
not far from his bower, or summer home. He
anchored his boat and went ashore with his
gun and umbrella. He found things just about
as he had left them.
Being very tired, Robinson Crusoe climbed
over the hedge and lay down to rest. He soon
fell fast asleep.
After he had slept for a while, he was
aroused suddenly. Someone was calling his
name.
"Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe!" the voice
said. "Poor Robin Crusoe. Where are you,
Robin Crusoe? Where have you been?"
Was he dreaming?
60
Again came the voice, "Where are you,
Robin Crusoe?"
Robinson looked all around. Then he saw
his parrot sitting on a post near his hammock.
Robinson had no idea how the bird had
found him.
He called "Poll," and the parrot came and
sat on his finger.
"Poor Robin Crusoe," Poll said. "Where
are you? Where have you been? How came
you here?"
"Well, well," said Robinson. "I am glad to
see you, Polly. How is everything at home?"
Robinson left his boat at anchor in the
creek and walked back to his castle. You can-
not imagine how glad he was to be safe at
home again.
He spent the next rainy season learning
how to make better kettles and baskets.
One day Robinson noticed that he did not
have much powder left.
"Now," he said, "I must certainly raise my
own goats and have my meat always on hand."
62
He at once began to plan to catch some wild
goats. He made traps so that he could catch
the animals alive. The wire in the traps was
not strong enough to hold the goats, however,
and they were able to escape. Robinson puz-
zled over what he should do next.
Finally, he thought of digging several large
pitfalls, or holes in the ground. Over the holes
he placed boards in such positions that they
would fall easily if goats should step on them.
He scattered grain on these boards for bait.
One day, when he went to see what luck
he was having, he found an old goat in one
pitfall and three kids in another.
The goat was so cross that Robinson did not
dare to go near him; so he let him go. He
tied the three kids together with cords and
took them home.
It was difficult for Robinson to get the kids
to eat. He waited until they were very hungry.
Then he tossed them grain. At last they be-
came so tame that they would feed from his
hand.
68
He knew he must keep the kids from the
wild goats or they would run away. He chose
a wide grassy place near plenty of water and
built a hedge around it.
While he was building the hedge, he kept
the young goats near him. By the time the
hedge was finished, the goats were so tame
that they followed him everywhere, and Robin-
son enjoyed their company.
In a year and a half Robinson had quite a
large flock of goats.
Besides having meat, he now had goat's
milk to use. After numerous trials and fail-
ures he succeeded in making both butter and
cheese.
The skins of the goats furnished him with
clothing, but Robinson did not look handsome
in his goatskin clothes. His cap had an ugly
flap hanging down behind to keep the sun
from burning his neck and the rain from run-
ning down his back. His stout jacket was very
long. The trouser legs, which reached to his
ankles, were cut up the sides to the knees. On
64
his feet and legs he wore short boots, made
of goatskin and laced up with strips of leather.
Robinson wore a broad belt made of goat-
skin around his waist. Hanging from one
side of the belt was a small saw, and from the
other a hatchet. He carried, on a strap under
his left arm, two goatskin pouches, one for
powder and one for shot.
On his back Robinson carried a basket, and
on his shoulder, a gun.
He held his goatskin umbrella over his head
to protect him from the sun.
His face was covered with a beard. He kept
his beard cut short with the scissors he had
brought from the ship.
Robinson was much pleased with his new
clothes. He felt comfortable in them.
One day, dressed in his new outfit, Robinson
set out to see what had become of his canoe.
He went directly to his summer home and
found the boat lying just where he had left it.
He still was afraid to sail the rest of the way
around the island, however.
65
Robinson Crusoe was never idle. As his
goats grew older, he made his fence stronger.
When there were too many animals for one
pasture, he fenced a larger field for them.
He planted some grapes near his castle.
On his island Robinson was finding out how
much a person could do alone. He had pro-
vided for himself food, shelter, clothing, and
the companionship of animals. Still, however,
he missed the friendship of other people. He
wished he had someone to live for besides
himself.
Robinson Finds a Footprint
Robinson Crusoe had now been on the island
nearly twelve years. In all this time he had
not seen a human being, and he came and went
everywhere without fear.
One day Robinson had the greatest fright
of his life.
, When he was going toward his boat on the
shore, he came upon a fresh track in the sand.
He stopped to look at it. Surely it was the
footprint of a man. The toes and the heel
could be seen very clearly.
He ran up and down the shore looking for
more footprints, but he could find none. Then
he went back to make sure about the track he
had seen. There was no mistake. It was the
print of a man's foot!
Robinson went home very much afraid. He
looked behind him at almost every step. He
walked faster and faster. As he neared his
castle, he fairly ran in his fright.
He did not sleep that night. All sorts of
67
wild thoughts ran through his mind. How
could any human being come to his island?
Where was the ship that had brought him? It
must have been one of the savages from the
land that he could see far away. The man
might have rowed out to sea in a canoe and
been driven by the tides to this island.
A man surely had come ashore. Had he
gone again without seeing Robinson's castle?
"But how could a man who made this track
keep from seeing my boat?" Robinson asked
himself. "I wonder if he has gone back to get
more men to help attack me? If many come,
where shall I hide? They may destroy my
grain and let my goats out of the pasture.
Then I shall die of starvation."
Robinson forgot, in his fright, that God
would take care of him. For many days he
suffered greatly from fear. Then he tried to
make himself believe the footprint was his own.
He measured the track and found it much
smaller than his foot. He was now more
frightened than ever.
69
In the afternoon when he went out to milk
his goats, Robinson was on the lookout for
prowling savages. None came.
For days all was quiet, with no sign of any-
one. Robinson made up his mind that, though
men sometimes came to the island, they did not
stay there. However, he began to make his
fortress stronger. He worked hard on it for
many days. He built a larger and thicker wall
outside the first one. He used heavy pieces of
timber, stones, and everything he could find
to strengthen both walls.
In the outer wall Robinson left seven holes.
He could push seven guns through these and,
if necessary, he could fire the guns, one after
another, toward the shore.
''Now," he said, "if the savages come again,
they will think there are many people in this
fort, and will be afraid to return."
Robinson then began to think of his treas-
ures. He decided that he must find a cave
where he could hide his goats.
One day when he was on the far side of the
70
island in search of a cave, he thought he saw
a boat in the distance. Once he would have
been overjoyed to see a boat, but now he was
filled with fear.
He hurried back to his castle. Taking his
spyglass along, he climbed to the top of a near-
by hill. But he saw nothing more of the boat.
He went again to the other side of his island,
watching all the way. There were no men
there, but many bones were scattered about on
the sand. They were the bones of human bodies.
Robinson saw a place where a fire had been
made, but the men who had made it were gone.
At first Robinson was too much surprised
to be afraid. He had heard about people
called cannibals who killed and ate their en-
emies. It seemed that some of those wicked
men had been coming to his island—this love-
ly, peaceful island!
He was thankful that his home was not near
this place. There was little danger of savages
coming near the castle, for there was no safe
landing place on his side of the island.
71
He again made up his mind that the savages
never stayed long on his island. Perhaps they
came only when they wanted a feast. How-
ever, after this, he was always watchful.
About a year later Robinson had some good
fortune. While he was cutting down branches
of trees with which to make charcoal, he found
a hollow place behind some low brushwood.
It was a small opening to a cave.
It was very dark in the cave. Robinson
started into it, but came out again very quick-
ly. He had seen two big shining eyes only a
few feet away.
Robinson knew that all animals are afraid
of fire; so, when he had aroused his courage,
he lighted a torch and started in again. He
had gone not more than a step or two when he
was more frightened than ever. He had heard
a loud moan, as if from someone in pain.
Robinson turned to run, but stopped.
"What a coward I am," he thought. "If
someone is in there, he is suffering and cannot
harm me."
72
He turned about and lifted his torch. What
do you think he saw?
A huge old goat was lying on the ground
gasping for breath. The goat was too ill to
get up; so Robinson did not disturb him.
As Robinson went farther into the cave, he
saw an opening on the opposite side. Since he
had no candle with him, he did not try to reach
this opening.
The next morning he came back with sev-
eral candles. He had made them from goats'
tallow. For wicks he had used bits of old rope.
When Crusoe entered the cave, he found
that the poor old goat was dead. He stopped
to dig a hole and bury him.
He then found the opening he had seen the
day before and began to crawl through the
cave on his hands and knees.$
When he had crawled about thirty feet, he
came into a very large room. It was large
enough to hold a hundred men. In the light
from Crusoe's candle, the walls of the cave
shone like diamonds. The ceiling was about
73
twenty feet above the floor, which was level and
covered with fine, dry sand.
At last Robinson had found a wonderful
storehouse and a place where he could hide
from any foe. How thankful he was!
The next day he carried most of his powder
and the lead for molding bullets to this dry
place. He felt like the giants he had read
about in fairy stories, who lived among rocks
and caves where no one could get at them.
From this time on, Robinson spent part of
his time in the cave. No place, however, seemed
so homelike as the kitchen in his castle.
He now cared little whether or not he left
the island, and he had almost stopped caring
whether or not he had company. His parrot
had learned to speak very well and, as parrots
often live a hundred years, Robinson thought
he would not be left alone. The old dog had
died, but Robinson always kept two or three
tame cats. Besides these pets, he had a few
tame kids and a number of tame sea birds. The
birds made their nests in the hedges.
74
Exciting Times
Thus year after year passed. Robinson had
almost ceased looking for the return of the
cannibals.
One morning, when he had been on the
island about twenty-three years, he went out
quite early. He was astonished to see a light
on the shore not far from his first home, or
castle. The light was about two miles away.
"The cannibals must be here again,"
thought Robinson. "Shall I go home, or hide
in the cave?
"I will go to my castle," he decided. "My
guns are there, and I can defend myself
well from my fort."
He went back toward his castle, climbed the
outer wall, and drew the ladder after him.
When Robinson had waited quietly for about
two hours, he crept out with his spyglass and
went to the top of the hill. He lay flat on the
ground and began to look for the savages.
Soon he saw nine naked men sitting around a
75
great fire. As they did not need a fire for
warmth, he knew they must be having another
horrible feast.
The savages had two canoes, which they had
hauled up on the shore. Soon they began to
dance. They danced until the tide came in;
then they launched their boats and paddled
out to sea.
After they were gone, Robinson went down
to the shore. He found the bones of the poor
men the cannibals had eaten.
The next year Robinson had a new experi-
ence. One night, as he sat in his castle reading
his Bible, he thought he heard the sound of a
gun. It seemed to come from the sea. At first
he was startled.
"Oh, joy!" he then thought, "that shot comes
from a large ship at sea. Will the crew land?
Will they be friendly? I must not let them
get away!"
Robinson ran to the top of the hill as fast
as he could. He saw a flash of fire and heard
another report of a gun. This meant that
76
there was a ship in trouble. The men were
firing to call someone to their aid.
Robinson brought together all the wood he
could collect and made a great bonfire on top
of the hill. When the men on board the ship
saw the bonfire, they signaled with their guns
to show that they had seen it.
Robinson kept the fire burning all night.
The next morning, using his spyglass, he could
see the outline of a ship. It was a great dis-
tance away and seemed to be standing at
anchor.
All day he watched the ship. It did not
seem to move.
Robinson then took his gun and went down
to the beach to get a better view. From there
he could see that the ship was a wreck. It had
been dashed on the rocks, just as his own ves-
sel had been wrecked twenty-four years before.
Robinson wept, for he feared that, in trying
to help the ship's crew, he had drawn them
onto the rocks with his bonfire.
Had the men climbed into their lifeboats
77
and been lost at sea? Were they still alive on
the ship?
"Oh," thought Robinson, "if there is even
one man left on board, I will save him for a
companion."
The sea was now so calm that Robinson
thought he would venture out in his boat to
see if he could reach the wreck.
He hastened back to his castle to get bread,
fresh water, and a basket of raisins. After tak-
ing these food supplies down to his boat, he
went back and got some rice, a jar of goat's
milk, and his umbrella.
When Robinson was finally ready to start,
he was afraid to launch his boat. He feared
that it might be driven by the currents and
wrecked as the ship had been.
He watched the sea all day.
The next morning he set out with the first
tide. This tide carried him directly toward the
ship, which he found to be stuck fast between
two rocks. Half of the hull had been beaten
to pieces by the waves.
78
As Robinson came close to the ship's side,
a dog appeared on the deck and began to cry
pitifully. Robinson called to the dog. The
poor creature jumped overboard, and Robinson
took it into the boat with him. It was almost
dead from thirst and hunger. Robinson gave
it a piece of bread and some fresh water.
When Robinson went on board, he found the
bodies of two men who had been drowned,
lying in the forward part of the ship.
The dog was the only live creature that had
been left on the ship.
The back of the ship had been broken on
the rocks, and most of the goods there were
spoiled by water.
Robinson found two chests, which he loaded
on his boat. He was very glad to get, also, a
fire shovel and tongs, some little brass kettles, a
gridiron, and a great powder horn full of
powder.
There were three large bags of gold pieces
on the ship. What use, though, did Robinson
have for money?
79
He was more pleased with the gridiron than
with all the gold he found. Thinking he might
sometime get back to his own country, finally
he took the bags of money with him.
When Robinson reached home and opened
the chests, he was happy to find that they were
full of wonderful and useful things. In one
of them was a fine lot of candy and sugarplums.
In the other were some good shirts and about
a dozen linen handkerchiefs.
Robinson for years had been wearing coarse
goatskins in this hot country. Think of wear-
ing a fur coat on a hot July day! You can
imagine how wonderful soft, thin clothing
seemed to him.
Robinson had needed shoes and stockings
for a long time. He hoped that he would find
some in one of the chests. He did find several
pairs of comfortable slippers, but he wanted
good stout shoes.
When Robinson had recovered from the
excitement of his trip, he felt very sad and
disappointed. The ship for which he had
80
been praying had come. The crew had been
very near; yet not one person had been spared
to be company for him.
"No one will ever find me, now," he thought.
"If I ever have a companion on this island,
he will be a savage—some poor man I have
saved and taught to speak my tongue."
Robinson thought about this very often.
One night he dreamed that he rescued a poor
savage from the cannibals.
82
Robinson's Man Friday
A year and a half passed without another
adventure. Then one morning Robinson saw
five canoes together on the shore on his side
of the island.
Though it was a poor landing place, men had
landed. They were out of sight. Robinson
knew that perhaps five or six of them had come
in each canoe. He wondered how he could
defend himself against so many. He took two
of his guns and went to the top of the hill to
look for the visitors.
Robinson lay flat on the ground so that his
head could not be seen while he looked through
his spyglass. He could see about thirty sav-
ages dancing around a great fire. While he
was watching, two poor captives were dragged
from the boat. They were brought on shore
and unbound.
As Robinson watched, he became very much
excited and frightened. One of the captives
was being made ready for the feast. The other
83
escaped and suddenly started to run directly
toward Robinson's castle!
"Now," thought Robinson, "they will all
follow him and find my castle. What shall I
do?
"There are many of the savages. They will
kill me and eat me."
However, only three men followed the cap-
tive, who was a good runner and gained
ground very fast. Still using his spyglass,
Robinson watched the four.
Between the men and the castle was a stream
of water. When the captive came to this
stream, he swam quickly across. He ran on as
fast as he could. Only two of the cannibals
followed him. The third did not seem to be
able to swim. He slowly went back to the
shore and to his friends.
Now Robinson had a chance to get a com-
panion. He seized his guns and ran down
the hill between the captive and the pursuers.
Since he did not want to shoot and draw the
attention of the other cannibals, he used his
84
gun as a club. He knocked down the first
cannibal. The second began to fit his bow
and arrow to shoot Robinson, who then had to
use his gun and shoot first.
When the poor captive saw his enemies fall,
he stopped running. He was so alarmed at
the sound of the gun that he stood perfectly
still. Robinson called and beckoned to him to
come nearer. Being thus encouraged, the poor
fellow came. After every few steps he knelt
down to show that he was grateful to Robinson
for saving his life.
The man came quite near and knelt again
before Robinson. He laid his head upon the
ground and placed Robinson's foot upon it.
This meant that he was willing to be Robin-
son's slave forever.
Robinson raised the man from the ground,
and the grateful savage understood that he had
a friend.
By this time the man was ready to speak.
Robinson could not understand what he said,
but the voice of his new servant sounded very
85
pleasant to him. It was the first human voice
he had heard in more than twenty-five years.
Now Robinson made signs that they must
hide or the cannibals would follow them. The
savage, however, made signs that first he want-
ed to bury the two men who had been killed.
He scooped the sand with his hands so fast
that in fifteen minutes both were out of sight.
Robinson then took the man to the rocky
cave on the other side of the island. His new
friend needed food and rest. Robinson gave
him some bread, raisins, and fresh water. He
then made signs for him to lie down on a bed
of rice straw covered with a blanket. The poor
fellow lay down and was soon fast asleep.
The young savage was tall, strong, and well
built. His hair was long and black, his skin
dark, and his eyes black and sparkling. When
he smiled, his teeth looked like ivory. Robin-
son was much pleased with him.
After he had slept for about half an hour,
the savage came out of the cave to look for
his new master. When he saw Robinson, he
86
knelt before him. Again he laid his head on
the ground and placed his master's foot upon
it. Robinson showed that he was pleased with
him.
Crusoe began to teach his new servant to
speak his own language. He told him his
name should be Friday. Can you guess why?
Friday was the day of the week on which
the savage had been saved from the cannibals.
Robinson taught Friday to call him "mas-
ter." He also taught him to say "yes" and
"no," and made him understand what the words
meant.
Robinson gave Friday some milk in one of
the earthen jars. He showed him how to dip
his bread into it. Friday liked bread and milk
very much.
That night both men slept in the cave.
The next day Robinson made Friday un-
derstand that he must wear clothes. Friday
had never worn clothes before. He was very
proud, though, when he had a fine, new suit
much like Robinson's own. Friday's cap was
87
made of hareskin, his trousers of cotton cloth,
and his shirt of goatskin.
Robinson taught Friday everything he could
that would make him more helpful. He was
very anxious to have him learn to speak English.
Friday was a bright pupil and learned easily.
Now Robinson's life was so happy and com-
fortable that he really did not care if he never
left the island.
In a short time Friday had learned to wear
clothes and to eat the same kind of food his
master ate. Besides, he was learning very
quickly to speak his master's language.
One day Robinson thought he would give
Friday a taste of goat's meat; so he took him
out to hunt. He wanted to show him a good
way of getting food.
They found an old goat and two kids lying
in the shade. Robinson told Friday to keep
very still. Then he shot one of the kids.
Poor Friday trembled with fear. He tore
off his clothing to see if the bullet had hit him.
His new master laughed.
88
After loading his gun again, Robinson shot
a large bird. He had thought it to be a hawk,
but found that it was a parrot.
Friday thought the gun a wonderful thing.
He talked to it and begged it not to kill him.
Robinson and Friday took the kid home,
dressed it, and cooked it. They stewed half
of it with rice and barley. They roasted the
other half by hanging it over a fire.
In order to hang the meat over the fire, two
forked stakes were set up, one on each side of
the blaze, and an iron rod was laid across the
forks. On this rod the meat was hung.
The roast was turned constantly to keep it
from burning.
When Friday tasted the goat's meat, he said
that he liked it better than anything he had
ever eaten.
One day Robinson taught Friday to pound
grain into meal. He also showed him how to
sift the meal and to make bread. After this
Friday always mixed the dough and did the
baking. He became a good baker.
89
Having two mouths to feed instead of one,
Robinson had to raise more grain. In order
to do this, he laid off a larger piece of ground
and planted a hedge around it.
Friday was always willing to do his part
and worked very hard.
Though Friday had been with Robinson less
than a year, he spoke English well.
Robinson was very happy to have someone
with whom he could visit. His servant was
faithful, honest, and a real friend to him.
One day Robinson wished to see if Friday
was homesick and began to ask him questions.
This is about the way they talked:
Robinson: Friday, did your nation ever win
any battles?
Friday: Yes, my peoples always fight best.
Robinson: If that is so, how was it that you
were taken prisoner?
Friday: They many more than my peoples
in place where Friday was. They take one,
two, three, and me. My nation beat them in
other place where me no was.
90
Robinson: But why didn't your people take
you away from your enemies?
Friday: Enemy he run away with one, two,
three, and Friday, and make us go in canoe.
My nation have no canoe that time.
Robinson: What do your people do with
the men they take in war? Do they eat them
as these other men do?
Friday: Yes, my nation eats mans, too.
Eats them all up.
Robinson: Where do your people bring
their captives?
Friday: To this island.
Robinson: Have you been here before?
Friday: Yes, Friday been there.
He pointed to the other side of the island.
At another time Robinson and Friday
walked to that side of the island. Friday told
his master that one day his nation had come
there with twenty captives.
Friday could not count twenty, but he put
twenty stones in a row, one for each man.
Robinson then asked him many questions
91
about the country they were able to see so far
away. Friday said that those who lived there
were called Caribs because they lived near the
Caribbean sea. He said that far away there
were some bearded men who were white like
his master. Robinson felt sure that Friday
meant the Spaniards. He asked Friday if there
was any way they could go in a boat and find
these white men.
"Yes, yes," Friday replied, "go in two canoe."
Friday meant that they could go in a boat
as large as two canoes. Robinson again began
to think a great deal about getting away from
the island.
92
The Shipwrecked Sailors
When Friday could understand everything
his master said, Robinson told him about his
own life. He told him how long he had been
on the island, how he came to be there, and of
many of his strange adventures.
He also told him about the country in which
he had lived when a boy. He said that the
people who lived there were good and wor-
shiped God. They thought it was wrong to
hurt one another.
At last Robinson told Friday of the ship
that was wrecked on the rocks a few years
before. He took him down to the beach and
pointed to the place in the sea .where the ves-
sel had gone to pieces.
Friday stood for a long time thinking.
"Me see boat like that," he said, "and some
white mans come to my nation."
Robinson learned afterward that such a boat
really had been near the island where Friday
lived.
93
"My peoples save white mans from drown,"
said Friday. "The boat full of white mans."
He told his master upon his fingers that
there had been seventeen men in the boat.
"They live with my peoples," he said.
"Are they living with your people now?"
asked Robinson.
"Yes, mans have been there four years," re-
plied Friday.
"Why did not your people eat them?" asked
Robinson.
"My people no eat them. Make brothers of
them. They no eat mans except they make the
war fight," said Friday.
How glad Robinson was to know that there
were white men not far away! He thought
every day of how he might reach them.
One time he and Friday were at the top of
the hill where they could look off and see the
other faraway shore which Robinson had
sighted. Friday began to dance and sing.
"Oh, joy! Oh, glad!" he sang. "There is
my nation, my country!"
94
.' f-:-
-4
Robinson began to fear that Friday was
homesick and might go away and leave him.
He thought Friday might even tell his people
about his white master and the treasures in the
cave. The savages might then come and take
these treasures away from Robinson.
Would Friday forget that Robinson had
saved his life and do so cruel a thing?
"He is nothing but a savage," thought Rob-
inson. "Perhaps he doesn't know any better."
"Friday," Robinson asked, "do you wish to
go back to your home in your own country?"
"Yes," replied Friday, "me be much glad to
be with my own nation."
"What would you do there?" asked Robin-
son. "Would you be wild again? Would you
be a savage as you were before?"
Friday shook his head.
"Oh, no," he said. "Friday tell people to live
good. Friday tell them to pray to God. He
tell them to eat bread and goat's flesh and milk.
Never eat mans again."
"Then," said Robinson, "they will kill you."
95
"No," said Friday, "they no kill me. They
love learn. They learn from white mans who
come in boat."
"Would you go back to them, Friday, and
leave your master?" asked Robinson.
Friday shook his head. "No, master," he
said. "Friday no swim so far."
"I will make a canoe for you, Friday," said
Robinson.
"Friday will go if master go with him,"
said Friday.
"But these people would eat me if I went
there," said Robinson.
"No, no! Me make them no eat you," re-
plied Friday. "Me make them love you."
Then Friday told Robinson once more how
kind his people had been to the white men
who had come on shore. It made Robinson
wish more than ever to see these white men.
He felt sure that, together, they could plan
some way to get back to Europe.
Soon after this Robinson took Friday across
the island and showed him where he kept his
97
boat. They both climbed into it, and Friday
paddled about in great glee. Robinson saw
that he was very skillful in managing a boat.
"Now," said Robinson, "shall we go to your
nation?"
Friday answered that the boat was too small.
Robinson told him about the large boat he
had made. He showed him this first boat and
explained how he had not been able to move
it to the water.
Friday thought this boat was big enough.
Robinson had not taken good care of the
boat, however, and some of the parts were
falling to pieces. It had lain in the rain and
sun for twenty years.
"Very well, Friday," said Robinson. "We
will make another boat as large as this. Then
you may go to your home."
Friday looked very sad.
"Why is master angry with Friday?" he
said. "Why send Friday back to nation?"
"But did you not say you wished you were
there?" asked Robinson.
Friday shed tears. He said he would not
go unless Robinson would go with him.
"Take, kill Friday," he cried, "but do not
send Friday away from master. No one ever
so kind to Friday before."
When Robinson saw how much Friday
cared for him, he made up his mind to go
with him to his home.
Robinson began to build his third boat.
This time he was careful to choose a tree that
was near the water so that the boat could be
launched easily. Friday wished to burn the
tree out, but Robinson showed him how to
use tools.
In about a month of hard work they hol-
lowed out the log. They then shaped the out-
side as they wanted it.
When the boat was finished, it was strong,
fine looking, and large enough to carry twenty
men. It took Robinson and Friday nearly two
weeks to move it down to the water. They
pushed it along on rollers a few inches at a
time. This was very hshrd work.
99
The boat was large, but Friday could turn
it about on the water as lightly as if it were
very small. He said that they could go to the
other island in this boat even in a great wind.
Robinson, however, was not ready to start.
He did not want to paddle the boat such a long
distance. He wanted the wind to carry it along
part of the way. He had Friday cut down a
young cedar tree, and showed him how to shape
it into a beautiful mast. Robinson made a sail
of pieces of the old sails he had brought from
the wreck. He also made a rudder with which
the boat could be steered.
Even now it was not time to start for the
other island. Robinson waited for fair weather.
Friday dug a little dock in which to keep the
boat. They then laid a great many boughs over
it to keep off the rain.
Three months had passed since they had cut
down the tree of which this fine, new sailboat
was made.
100
Robinson Rescues Friday's Father
Robinson still marked the passage of time on
his post calendar. He knew that he had been
on the island twenty-seven years. Friday had
been with him for three years.
"Friday, before another year has passed,"
said Robinson one day, "I believe I shall be
at home with my own people. I think this
will be my last year on the island."
Robinson dug the ground and planted his
seed, however, as he had done in other years.
When the work was finished, he spent much
time getting ready for his voyage.
One morning Friday started down to the
shore to get a turtle for dinner. He went only
a short way, then came running back. He flew
over the outside wall, shouting to Robinson.
"Oh, master! Oh, sorrow! Oh, bad!" he
cried out.
"What is it, Friday?" asked Robinson.
"Yonder, one, two, three canoe," cried Fri-
day, trembling all over.
101
"But do not be frightened, Friday," said
Robinson. "Our guns will drive the visitors
away."
Friday was very much frightened, however.
He believed the men had come to look for him.
It was some time before Robinson could per-
suade Friday to go with him to help carry the
guns. At last the servant followed.
They went to the top of the hill and took
turns looking toward the shore with the spy-
glass. There they saw three canoes and about
twenty cannibals getting ready for a feast.
When Robinson and Friday had reached
the edge of the wood, Friday saw one of the
captives. He was a white man.
Robinson was very angry. He told Friday
that he was going down to the shore and shoot
all of the cannibals.
Friday wanted to go with him.
The two men crept toward the cannibals
very quietly until they were within a few yards
of them. They could see the savages huddled
togther around their fire.
102
Suddenly Robinson and Friday fired their
guns from behind a clump of bushes. The
terrified savages ran in all directions. Robin-
son and Friday rushed out, shouting loudly.
They fired their guns several times.
Seventeen of the cannibals were killed. The
remaining four jumped into a canoe and pad-
dled away very rapidly. The, white captive
was left bound on the beachPA
When Robinson unbound him, he learned
that the man was a Spaniard. Friday said that
he was one of the white men who had lived on
the island with his people.
The savages had left two canoes behind
them. In the bottom of one was another cap-
tive, who seemed nearly dead. When Friday
saw his face, he gave a shout of joy. He cried
and laughed and jumped about, dancing and
singing in great glee.
"Oh, joy! Oh, good!" he shouted to Robin-
son. "Oh, master, you save Friday's life. Now
master save Friday's father! Friday love mas-
ter more! Oh, joy! Oh, happy!"
104
The two captives were suffering from hunger
and thirst. Robinson and Friday gave them
bread, raisins, and fresh water. Soon the two
felt better and were able to walk to the castle.
They were too weak to climb the ladder, how-
ever. Robinson and Friday put up a nice tent
for them outside the hedge and made two new
beds of rice and straw.
"Now," said Robinson to himself, "at last
I have plenty of company. I am a king, and
these are my subjects. But how shall I feed
so large a family?"
Friday killed one of the goats and cut the
meat into small pieces. He then built a fire,
and soon a fine stew was cooking for their sup-
per. It smelled good to the men.
When the meal was ready, they all sat down
together and ate heartily.
Robinson feared that the cannibals would
come back in large numbers for their pris-
oners; but Friday and his father were not
afraid.
Friday said their enemies were much too
105
frightened. They believed that the men who
fired the guns were evil spirits and that the
shots were thunder and lightning. Friday had
heard the men shouting these things to each
other as they ran toward the boats.
Robinson himself did not feel certain of the
safety of his little kingdom. For many days
he kept watch, but there was no sign of the
savages. His island was peaceful.
106
Robinson could speak Portuguese and a
little Spanish, two languages which are much
alike; so he was able to talk with the Spaniard.
In talking with him, Robinson learned that it
was he and his companions who had escaped
from the wrecked ship. They had got away
in a lifeboat and had reached the other island.
The savages had been kind to them.
The Spaniard said that he and his friends
were very homesick but could think of no way
of getting home.
"Do you think," Robinson asked, "that your
friends would be grateful if I should bring
them to this island and later help them to get
home? Would they treat me well and not
make me a captive?"
"I am sure they would be grateful," the
Spaniard replied, "and I believe you could
trust them."
The Spaniard then said that he would go
back and tell his friends about Robinson's
107
plan. He would take Friday's father with him
to help manage the boat. He would return
soon with an answer. He said that before he
brought his friends to the island he would have
everyone promise to make Robinson captain
of the ship which would take them home. They
would then obey him in everything.
"You have saved my life, kind master," he
added, "and I will fight for you until my dying
day. These friends of mine are all honest fel-
lows. They are in great distress. They have
no clothes, weapons, or proper food. I am
sure they will welcome any hope of returning
home, and will reward you for your trouble."
Though Robinson wished the Spaniard to go
for his friends, he saw that more food would
be needed for all of them to eat. The rice and
barley which he had laid aside for his voyage
were not enough to feed fourteen more men on
a long trip. He put his three men to work at
digging the ground for larger crops. Then he
sowed all the seed he could spare.
While waiting for the grain to grow, the
108
four went about the island selecting trees of
which to build a large ship. They even began
the work of making planks out of some of
the large trees.
Robinson added to his flock of goats. When
the grapes ripened, he dried enough to fill
sixty or eighty barrels.
Robinson then told the Spaniard he might
go to the other island for his friends.
At last the Spaniard and Friday's father
started off in one of the canoes. They had
guns, powder, plenty of raisins, bread, and wa-
ter. Before starting they agreed upon a signal
which they would give on their return. Thus
Robinson and Friday might know when their
boat was approaching the shore.
Robinson and Friday waited for them for
about eight days. Then one morning Friday
came running to his master.
"Master, master, they have come," he cried.
Robinson ran toward the shore. There,
about four miles out, was a large ship with its
sails set.
109
Robinson could also see a small boat coming
toward the shore.
"That is not our boat," said he. "It is coming
from the ship—an English ship, I believe."
"What would bring an English ship here?"
he asked himself. "The English do not trade
in this part of the world. Perhaps it is a pirate
ship. If the crew are pirates, we are much bet-
ter off here by ourselves."
The small boat was soon near the shore. It
landed about a half mile from Robinson's
castle. Robinson was certain the men were
Englishmen. There were eleven in all. Three
of them were bound and had no guns. They
seemed to be begging the others for mercy.
Robinson was too much astonished to know
what to think. Why had these men been
brought bound to his door?
Friday stood by him, greatly excited.
"Master," he whispered, "you see English
mans eat their prisoners, too."
"Oh, no, Friday," said Robinson, "they are
not going to eat them."
110
"Yes," Friday answered, "they eat mans all
up."
"No," said Robinson again, "they will not
eat them, but I am afraid they are going to
kill them."
Robinson and Friday kept very quiet and
waited to see what their visitors would do. The
three prisoners were left alone while the other
men ran about on the shore.
Robinson thought of his own feelings at the
time he first came ashore. He was very sorry
for the captives.
"God took care of me," he said, "and I will
take care of these poor men."
He asked Friday to bring two guns and fol-
low him. Robinson himself made a very
strange-looking figure. He had on his goat-
skin coat and cap. A bare sword was at his
side. Two pistols were in his belt, and a gun
was upon each shoulder.
When they were near the three captives,
Robinson called to them in Spanish.
"What are ye, gentlemen?" he said.
ill
The captives started in surprise when they
saw Robinson's strange figure, but they made
no answer. Then Robinson spoke in English.
"Gentlemen," he said, "do not be surprised
at me. I am your friend."
"Then you must be sent from heaven, for
we are past the help of man," replied one of
the men.
"All help is from heaven," answered Robin-
son. "If you will tell me what you need, I will
try to aid you. I saw that you begged the
wretches who came with you not to kill you."
Tears ran down one poor man's face.
"Are you a man or an angel?" he asked.
"Have no fear, sir," Robinson replied. "If
an angel had been sent to serve you, he would
have come in better clothes than these. I am
an Englishman like yourself. My servant and
I have guns. We can help you if you will tell
us how."
"Sir," answered the man, "I was captain of
that ship. Three days ago these men rose
against me. I begged them not to kill me; so
112
they consented to leave me on this lonely shore
with my mate and a passenger of the ship."
"Do you know where those wicked men
have gone?" asked Robinson.
"There they are, sir," replied the captain,
pointing toward the other eight men, who were
under a clump of trees. "If they see you, they
will kill us all."
"I see they are all asleep," said Robinson.
"It would be an easy thing to kill them, but I
shall make them prisoners instead."
"There are two very wicked fellows among
them," said the captain. "If you can bind
them, the others may do what is right."
"Let us get far enough away to talk things
over without waking them," said Robinson. "I
will unbind your feet."
When they had walked some distance, Robin-
son spoke again to the captain.
"If I save you, will you and your friends
do everything I tell you?" he asked.
The captain gladly promised Robinson that
they would.
113
"You must promise me two things, then,"
said Robinson. "First, as long as you are on
the island, you and your men will do what I
tell you. Second, if we save the ship, you will
take my friends and me to England without
charging us for our passage."
"With all my heart I promise both," an-
swered the captain, "for I shall owe my life to
you."
Robinson then unbound the hands of the
captain and of the men with him and gave each
man a gun with which to defend himself.
The men of the crew were now awake. Rob-
inson and the captain, with their followers,
advanced upon them.
Robinson and his men were not successful
in capturing all of the crew alive. Two of the
wicked men were killed. The others gave up
and promised to obey the captain's orders.
The captain, however, was not willing to
trust all of them; so Robinson had some of the
men tightly bound.
114
Robinson Captures the Rebels
That evening, when Robinson and the cap-
tain were safe in the castle, each told the other
the story of his life. The captain thought Rob-
inson's story the most wonderful he had ever
heard. Robinson said that he was the prince
of the island. This was his castle, which was
well fortified. He had, also, a country home,
which he promised to show to the captain the
next day.
The prisoners were put in the cave. Friday
stayed outside the cave all night to keep them
from getting away.
The chief thing for Robinson's men to do
now was to get the ship for themselves. The
captain said that there were still twenty-six men
on board, so many that there was little use to
attack them.
Robinson did not sleep very much that night.
He was trying to think of a way to capture
the ship without losing any of his men.
The next morning he found out from the
115
captain that the people on the ship had another
small boat.
"They will wonder," declared Robinson,
"why the men who came on shore do not re-
turn. Surely some of them will come to look
for these men. We must disable the boat that
brought you to shore. Then we must seize
the boat that brings more men, whom we can
easily make prisoners. After that we can over-
come the few still left on the large ship."
Robinson was right. The next day the men
on the ship put up a signal and fired a gun.
When they received no signal in return, some
of the men launched a small boat and rowed
for the shore.
There were at least ten men in the boat, and
they had guns. The captain knew every one
of them. Three of them, he said, were honest
fellows who had been led into evil by others.
The rest were to be feared.
"I have learned to fear nothing," Robinson
told the captain, "and I am sure that our lives
are worth fighting for."
116
The men from the ship tied their boat to
a large rock. All came ashore except three
who were left behind as guards. The men
who landed ran at once to the other boat, which
they found overturned. There was a hole in
the bottom of it. The seamen sent up great
shouts and fired a volley of shot. They hoped
their friends on the island would hear them.
Their signals brought no answer, however.
The silence alarmed the men very much.
Some of them wanted to return to the ship.
The captain feared that they would do this.
He did not want to lose the ship; so he begged
Robinson to go out at once and capture these
men. Robinson, however, decided to wait and
see what they would do.
Finally, the seamen who had come ashore
decided to search for their missing comrades.
They kept close together and marched toward
the top of the hill above Robinson's castle.
When they got to the top, they shouted and
called until they were tired. They rested and
then shouted again.
117
"We shall wait until night," said Robinson,
"and then try to get between them and the
shore. After we have captured them, we will
signal the rest of the crew to land."
At length the men from the ship seemed
about ready to give up the search. Robinson,
who had decided what to do in such a case,
called Friday and the captain's mate to him.
"Listen," he said, "you must go a half mile
beyond the hill and shout as loudly as you can
to make these men believe you are their friends.
Keep out of sight and draw them as far back
on the island as possible. When you get them
tired out, come back here as fast as you can."
The seven seamen were just ready to return
to the boat when Friday and his companion
called. The men answered the call and fired a
shot as a signal. One more man came ashore
from the boat to go with them to find their
friends. This left only two on guard.
Friday and the mate kept on shouting. The
eight men ran over the hill toward them.
Robinson now had a chance to surprise the
119
two men who had been left in the boat. When
these men saw five armed soldiers attacking
them, they gave up their guns at once.
When Friday and the mate returned, they
told how they had led the eight seamen a merry
chase. Surely it would be some time before
the men could get back to this part of the island.
After several hours Robinson's men heard
them coming. All of the eight were com-
plaining loudly that they were lame and tired.
When they found their boat on the shore and
both guards gone, they were badly frightened.
"There must be cannibals on this island,"
they cried. "Where is the captain? Where
are the men we left in the boat? Where are
our other friends?
"Who was that calling? Maybe it was an
evil spirit. We have seen no enemy, but many
who came from the ship have disappeared."
As soon as it was dark, Robinson and his
friends attacked the eight men. The seamen
thought that a whole army was after them.
Robinson had ordered one of his men to
120
call out to the leader of the crew, whose name
was Tom Smith. Tom answered at once, for
he knew the voice.
"Here's our captain," said the man, "and
fifty men with him. They have been hunting
for you for two hours. Some of us have been
killed and some taken prisoners. If you don't
give up, you will be killed, too."
All of the seamen laid down their arms.
Then the captain and his men bound them.
The prisoners were much alarmed and begged
for their lives.
"Most cruel men," said the captain, "how
can you ask for mercy? You set me on what
you supposed a desert island. You thought
you would sail off with my ship and leave me
to starve. But, thank God, there are people on
the island. The governor, Robinson Crusoe,
is an Englishman. He could hang you if he
wished. But we are going to take you to Eng-
land, where you will surely hang for mutiny."
Robinson did not show himself. He went
to his castle and soon sent for the captain.
121
"Choose the worst of these fellows," he said,
"and tomorrow send them bound to the cave.
Friday will guard them. Those we can trust
we will keep with us to help capture the ship."
The prisoners lay bound on the shore all
night. The next morning the captain went
down to see how they were feeling.
Several of the men seemed sorry for what
they had done and promised the captain to
serve him faithfully. The captain believed
them and asked Robinson to trust them.
There were twelve men in all, then, who
started out to capture the ship. Robinson and
Friday stayed on the island to guard the pris-
oners, who could not be left alone.
The captain got control of the ship and
fired seven guns to let Robinson know that he
was successful. Some hours later Robinson,
who had gone peacefully to sleep, was wakened
by the captain's voice.
"My dear governor," the captain said, "here
is your ship. It is yours, and everything on it
is yours."
122
Robinson looked out and saw the great ship
riding the waves about a half mile from shore.
To see a ship waiting to take him home after
all these years was almost more than he could
bear. He could not speak for tears. He held
fast to the captain, and they both thanked God
for having rescued them.
The captain brought Robinson handsome
gifts from the ship. There were many good
kinds of food to eat. What pleased Robinson
most of all were six clean new shirts, six neck-
ties, two pairs of gloves, some stockings and
shoes, a hat, and a very fine suit of clothes like
the captain's own.
"How good it will seem," said Robinson to
himself, "after almost thirty long years, to be
dressed like other men again!"
Strange to say, however, Robinson felt very
queer in his new clothes. He had worn his
goatskin suit so long that he really felt more
comfortable in it.
123
Everything was now ready to take up the
ship's anchor and set sail. What, though, was
to be done with the prisoners in the cave?
The captain did not want to take them on
the ship for fear they would revolt again. Rob-
inson sent Friday and another man to bring
the prisoners to him. Dressed in his new
clothes, he talked with them. He told them
that he was governor of the island and that
they were now in his power. He said he knew
how they had treated their captain, and how
they had tried to leave him to starve on a lonely
island.
"Now," he said, "you will be put to death
for mutiny, or you must stay on the island and
let the ship go away without you. But I will
leave you safely here with all of my things, if
you are willing to stay."
After talking for a while, the men decided
to stay on the island. Robinson sent them
back to the cave. He advised the captain to
124
go on board the ship while he made his castle
ready for the men.
When the captain had gone, Robinson sent
for the prisoners again. He told them this
time how he had come to be on the island and
how he had lived all these years. He showed
them how he made his bread, how he planted
his grain, and how he dried his grapes. He
showed them his forts and his herds of goats,
and told them how to make butter and cheese.
Last of all, he told them of the Spaniards
who were to come to the island. He left a let-
ter for the Spaniards, and asked the prisoners
to treat them as brothers. Then he gave the
men some guns and powder. They seemed
grateful.
Robinson went aboard the ship, taking with
him his goatskin cap, his umbrella, his parrot,
and his faithful servant, Friday. He took also
the gold he had found on the other ships. It
would serve him well at last. When Robinson
felt the ship sailing away, he was very, very
happy, for at last he was going home.
125
Robinson left the island in December. He
had lived there for more than twenty-eight
years. His voyage home was a long one. The
ship, being six months upon the sea, did not
reach England until June. It now had been
more than thirty-five years since Robinson had
lived there.
He went to his old home. He felt very sad
when he found that his father and mother
were both dead. Two of his sisters were living,
and he found two children of one of his
brothers. All of them were surprised to see
him, for they had believed him to be dead.
The owners of the vessel gave Robinson a
gift of a thousand dollars for saving the ship.
This sum, with the gold that he had brought
from the island, helped him to set up a new
business. He later received a large sum of
money from his plantation in South America.
His honest partners had saved it for him. Soon
Robinson became a very rich man.
His faithful Friday he kept always with him.
Strange to say, however, now that he was back
126
in England, Robinson longed to visit his desert
island again.
Seven or eight years later he did visit the
island. He found there a settlement of the
Spaniards who had been shipwrecked. They
had raised good crops and were living peace-
ably together. They had forced the prisoners
to do right.
Robinson was much pleased with what the
Spaniards had done. He gave them a supply
of arms, powder, shot, clothes, and tools, and
later sent them a carpenter and a smith from
England. He also sent them, from South
America, two ships loaded with cattle and hogs
and with many useful tools and seed. When
Robinson found that the Spaniards were will-
ing to spend the rest of their lives on the island,
he had these supplies divided among them.
Robinson spent twenty days on the island and
then went home feeling that his hard work had
not been in vain. For had he not settled a lit-
tle country of his own?
