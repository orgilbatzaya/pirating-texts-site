ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I am the sou of a merchant, and was born at York, in 1632,
and babtized Robinson, after my mother's maiden name.
My father intended me for the law, and endeavoured to
educate me suitably; but to no purpose, for I was deter-
mined to go to sea.
My mother and father were very averse to it, and used 'a
multitude of arguments to dissuade me, but without effect;
my resolutions were fixed, and neither the entreaties of my
father nor mother could make any impression on me.
When I was about nineteen, meeting with one of my
school-fellows at Hull, who was going with his father (a
master of a ship) to London, I imparted to him my inten-
tion ; he promised me a free passage, and to provide me
with necessaries suitable to the voyage. And accordingly,
without imploring a blessing of my parents, I took shipping,
Septemher 1, 1651.
We had scarcely cleared the H umber, when we were
overtaken by a violent storm, and I, being extremely sick,
began to reflect on my father's advice, and the happiness of
the state of life which he had proposed for me, resolving, if
ever I should set my feet again on dry land, I would beg my
parents' pardon, and bid adieu to roving inclinations.
Such were my sentiments while the storm continued: but
it was no sooner over, ^than my resolutions decreased with
the danger :. particularly when my companion asked me if; I
was not a little frightened by the storm, which he saicL-w$$

only a cap-full of wind. < Come my lad/ said he, < turn out,
and see what fine weather we have now, and a bowl of good
grog will drown all your sorrows.' The grog was made, I
got very drunk, and all notions of returning home vanished.
I continued hot-headed several days, until I was alarmed by
a fresh accident, that had very near put a final end to my
wandering.
On the sixth day we anchored in Yarmouth Roads, where
we were wind-bound with several other vessels from New-
castle ; but having safe anchorage, a light ship, and good
cables, the sailors despised the danger, and were as merry as
if they had been on shore: but on the eighth day, there
arose such a gale as prevented our driving up the river, and
it still increasing, our vessel rode forecastle in, shipping
several seas.
A general horror seized the seamen, and the master criedr
4 Lord have mercy upon as, we shall all be lost!' I kept to
my cabin, very sick, till the apprehensions of death urged
me to come upon deck, and there I was most terribly fright-
ened. The sea ran mountains high, and destruction seemed
inevitable. Two ships had cut their masts by the board,
two had lost their anchors and were forced out, and we
were obliged to cut away our fore and mainmast. While
we were in this confusion, the master espied some light col-
liers, and fired a gun. I did not then understand the signal,
but it was a token of distress. They attended to the signal,
put out their long boat, saved us, and our ship sunk to the
bottom.
They landed us at Cromer, near Winterton Lighthouse,
from whence we walked to Yarmouth. In three days after
my arrival at this place, I met the young man who invited
me to go on board with his father. I observed a great
alteration in his behaviour; and he told me his father knew
who I was, and that I had taken this voyage only upon
trial.
When the captain saw me, * Young man,' said be, * you
ought never to go to sea any more, for depend upon it, you
never will be prosperous in seafaring. Pray tell me upon
what motive you first undertook this voyage V I told him
the whole. He then exclaimed, < if you do not return, and
submit to your parents, the vengeance of heaven will attend
you wherever you go.1 I had an inclination to return to
my father's, but that was soon overcome, by an opinion that
the neighbours would laugh at me. I hurried to London,
being resolved on another voyage; I met with the master
of a vessel going to Guinea, who engaged me. Having
some money, and making a smart appearance, I did not go
like a common sailor, for the captain told me I should be
his messmate, and have liberty to carry with me what mer-
chandise 1 should think lit to trade with. The kindness of
his offer greatly pleased me; and, conceiving I had now an
opportunity of making a fortune, I applied to my friends for
money to equip me for my voyage; upon which forty pounds
were remitted to me, with which I bought such goods as he
advised. He taught me the method of keeping a journal,
and other most useful parts of navigation; and, by his
advice, and my own application, in the course of the voyage,
1 became both a sailor and a merchant. During some part
of it I was ill, occasioned by the extraordinaay heat of the
climate, being almost fifteen degrees north of the line ;
however, I recovered, and managed my little stock so
well, that I brought over with me five pounds nine
ounces of gold dust, which sold in London for near 2001.
sterling.
Soon after my return, the captain died. This gave me
great uneasiness; yet I resolved to go a voyage with his
mate, who had got the command of the ship. This proved
an unsuccessful one. I reserved about £100 for the voyage,
and left the remainder with the captain's widow, and to sea
we went. But as we were sailing towards the Canary
Islands, we were chased by a Salee rover, who, in spite of
all the sail we could make, in a short time came up with us,
and we were to fight or be taken. She had eighteen guns,
and we but twelve. About three in the afternoon we en-
gaged, and several were killed on both sides; but at length
being overpowered by numbers, we were compelled to sub-
mit, and were carried into Salee. The mariners were sent
to be sold; but the pirate captain taking a particular liking
to me, kept me for his own slave.
After some time, my patron became so poor, that he could
not fit out his ship; he then employed himself once or twice
a week in going a fishing, and I and a Morisco boy rowed
him. He was so much taken with my dexterity in fishing,
that he would often send me with his kinsman, and the boy
to catch fish for him. As we were one morning at the
sport, there arose so thick a fog, that we missed our way.
After rowing all night, at day-light we found ourselves at
least two leagues in the ocean ; we made shift, however,
to get on shore; and, to prevent the like misfortune in
future, my patron ordered a state-room to be built in the
middle of the long-boat, with a steerage behind.
Thus equipped, we often went out a fishing. On a parti-
cular occasion, he invited some persons of distinction to go
with him, and made extraordinary preparation for their en-
tertainment ; he likewise provided three fusees, with powder
and shot, that they might have sport at fowling. Next
morning the company altered their minds. However, he
ordered us to go and catch some fish. It was at this instant
I resolved to make my escape, and the better to effect it,
persuaded the Moor to get provision on board, with powder
and shot, to shoot curlews. I provided whatever else I con-
ceived necessary for the expedition.
Soon after we passed the castle we began to fish. I stood
further out to sea, and gave the boy the helm, and seizing
Muley by surprise, threw him overboard; ' Muley,1 said I,
* I never designed you any harm, and seek nothing but my
own redemption ; I know you are able to swim to shore:
but if you offer to follow me, I will shoot you through the
head.' At this the boy was exceedingly frightened; but I
assured him, ' if he would turn from Mahomet, and serve
me faithfully, I would be kind to him.' He consented.
We Continued our track on the Barbary coast until dusk,
when I changed my course, steering S. by E. that we might
keep near shore ; and having a favouring gale, the next
day we were Mty leagues beyond the Morocco dominions,
where I anchored in the mouth of a small river, which I
knew not. The necessary I stood in need of was fresh
water. My poor boy entreated me not to go on shore.
The noise of the wild beasts shocked us much;. and our ter-
rots increased, by observing one of the monsters approach-
ing us, but I shot at him. Next morning, I thought to go
on shore to get fresh water. I kept the boat in sight, lest
the savages should come down in their canoes, and seize it;
but my boy seeing a vale, ventured to it. On observing
him return with precipitation, I imagined he had been pur-
sued by the savages, or some wild beast; upon which I ran
towards him, being determined to protect him : but, as I
approached, I saw a creature hanging at his back resem-
fbling a hare, which proved to be very wholesome food. This
Iwas a pleasing circumstance: and my boy informed me that
Ithere was plenty of good water in the creek which my boat
^occupied.
i Here I recollected, that the Canary and Cape de Verd
llslands could not be very distant; but I knew not my latitude;
|l hoped, however, I should meet some English vessel, which,
would take us on board. I was doubtless in that uninhabited
country, which lies between the Emperor of Morocco's
dominions and the Negroes. It abounds with wild beasts, and
the Moors resort to it for hunting. From hence I thought
I perceived Mount Teneriffe, one of the Canaries: and tried
twice to steer that way, but was driven back.
Very early one morning we anchored at a small point,
and the tide beginning to flow, we were preparing to go
further in, but Xury, whose penetrating eyes saw further
than mine, desired me to keep to sea, or we should be de-
voured ; < for, look yonder, master,' said he, 6 and see tiat
huge monster fast asleep on de side of de hill.' He pointed
out the place, and I perceived a lion of an enormous size,
tasking himself under a hill. ' Xury,' said I, < you shall go
on shore and kill him.1' The boy stood amazed : < Me kill
him !' said he, ' he eat me at one mouth,' meaning one
mouthful. To appease the boy's fears, I shot at.him,, and
broke one of his legs; and then with another shot killed
him.
From hence we steered southward; and sailing pretty
near shore, we discovered several people looking after us :
we perceived they were blacks, all naked and unarmed,
except one, who had something in his hand like a stick,
which Xury said was a lance, with which they could kill at
a great distance. I was inclined to go on shore, but the
boy exclaimed, ' No, no.1 I drew as near the shore as 1
could, and conversed with them by signs, until I made them
understand I wanted something. They made signs to me
to stop, whilst two of them ran up into the country, and in
less than half an hour brought me two pieces of dried flesh
and some corn, which we gladly accepted ; and they, to pre-
vent our fears, laid it down, and went some distance off, till*
we had taken it on board, and then came to us again.
While We Were returning them our thanks, two uncom-
mon creatures ran from the mountains, eager to engage
each other, and jumped into the sea, where they swam about
wantonly, the water seeming to have abated their fury.
One of them approaching nearer my boat than I thought
consistent with safety, I fired at him, and had the good for-
tune to kill him. The consternation pf the negroes on
hearing the report of my gun, and seeing the beast killed by
it, is beyond the power of expression. Being furnished by
the negroes with the best provisions the country could afford,
I took my leave of them; and in eleven days1 sail came in
sight of the Cape de Verd Islands, but could not reach
either of them. On this disappointment, I became extremely
dejected; when on a sudden, Xury exclaimed, ' Mastro,
mastro, a great ship with sail V and soon I discovered a
Portuguese vessel.
Observing this, I set up my awning and fired a gun, as a
signal of distress; on which they very kindly lay-to until I
came up with them. There was a Scotch sailor on board,
to whom I explained my case; on which they took me into
their ship. My joy was exceedn^ great at this unexpected
deliverance, especially when I found the captain very kind
and compassionate to me, to whom* in return for his friend-
ship, I offered all I had, which he generously refused, telling
me, his Christian charity taught him better. I sold him my
boat for eighty pieces of eight.
After twenty-two days sail, we arrived at the Bay of All
Saints. Upon his recommendation, I engaged with a plan-
ter, in whose service I continued till I had acquired a su£-
ficient knowledge of sugar planting. I soon purchased a
plantation, and, by industry, made very considerable im-
provements, and began to thrive. I was, in some degree*
settled, before the captain left the Brazils. One day I told
him what cash I had left in London, and desired his
assistance in getting a remittance ; to which he readily
consented.
Wealth now began to flow in upon me, and I might have
lived very happily, if ambition and a roving inclination had
not got the ascendancy over me. I had lived some years in
the Brazils, and had not only learnt the language, but con-
tracted an acquaintance with several of the most eminent
merchants of St. Salvadore, to whom, reciting the circum-
stances of my two voyages to Guinea, and the immense
prolits made from trading in those parts, they so much ap-
proved my notions of that business, that three of them mani-
fested a desire of going thither: and, in order to induce
me to undertake the management of their business, declared,
if I would go as their supercargo, I should share equally
with them in the profit. I consented to this proposal, on
condition they would manage my plantation in my absence.
A ship being properly fitted out, J sailed September I, 1659,
steering northward, in order to make the coast of Africa.
In a few days we met with a violent storm, which held
twelve days. When the weather became clear, we found
ourselves in eleven degrees north latitude, on the coast of
Guinea. The:captain advised reluming. This I opposed,
judging it more prudent to stand away for Barbadoes, where
I concluded we might arrive in Mteew days. My opinion
prevailed, and changingLixur course, we steered westward,
in hopes of reaching tb$(Leeward Islands ; which we did,
and were overtaken by another terrible tempest, In this
distress, one of our meri cried out,' Land! land T That very
moment our ship struck upon a sand, and we expected we
should be immediately lost. In full expectation of death,
we applied to the last resort in such extremities, and
hauling out the long boat, eleven of us get on board of her,
avd submitted ourselves to the fury of the storm, and the
divine mercy. This effort proved ineffectual, for the tempest
was so violent that the boat could not live. After we had
been about two leagues, a wave a-stern overset the boat*
a3
During the time I was struggling in the water, my mind
laboured under the most excruciating distraction: still, how-
ever, I continued struggling (during which time all my
companions were lost) till the wave abated its force, and, in
retiring, had thrown me on shore. I got on my feet, lest
another wave should carry me back; and, though I made
the utmost expedition I was able, another came, which
threw me with such force against a rock as made me sense-
less. Fortunately I recovered before the approach of the
succeeding wave abated, by keeping fast hold of the rock,
which enabled me to get on shore, though in a very weak
and miserable condition.
The next day, it being calm weather, necessity impelled
me to risk all hazards to get on board the ship, in hopes of
procuring necessaries. I therefore swam round her; and
fortunately discovering a rope within my reach, I with some
difficulty got into the forecastle. The ship was bilged, but
fcer quarter was dry, and, thanks to heaven! all the pro-
visions were in good condition, and nothing wanting but a
boat to convey them on shore.
It is commonly said, necessity is the mother of invention.
I now experienced the truth of the adage; for a project
arose in my mind, which, under happier circumstances, it is
probable I might never have thought of. There were on
"board spare yards, masts, &c. I threw several of these over-
board, lashing them together that they might not be driven
away. I then laid three or four short planks on them
erossways, and fastened others together in form of a raft;
to strengthen which I cut a top-mast in several lengths,.
and braced the whole tight, which rendered it equal in
weight..
Raving thus contrived a very useful mode of conveyance,
my mind was next employed in making the most judicious
choice out of what I could find on board to load with, in
regard to my present necessities and future security. After
some deliberation, I proceeded in the following manner :—>
All the boards I could find I laid on the raft in the best
manner I was able; then lowered down three chests, and
filled them, with provisions^ I was chiefly solicitous to pro-
<t

cure working tools, fire-arms, powder, and bullets ; and
upon search, very luckily obtained the carpenter's chest,
and in looking into the cabin, I discovered several muskets,
and a quantity of ammunition. I laid them on board the raft
with joy, and again ventured to sea.
I had not proceeded above a mile before my raft run
aground. It was with the utmost difficulty I kept my cargo
together. Indeed, if I had not been extremely vigilant, the
whole would have been lost. But, at the rising of the
water, she floated again, and I landed my effects very safely.
Near the place where I landed, which was at the mouth of
a little cave, I discovered a very high mountain, surrounded
by several hills. I judged this would be a very proper
eminence from whence to take a survey of the country.
Accordingly, arming myself, I ascended the mountain,
and discovered that I was in an island surrounded by the sea.
It appeared uncultivated, and only inhabited by wild beasts.
I returned to the raft, and landed my goods. Dreading
the wild beasts, I erected a kind of barricado, by way of
security. That night I slept very well; and next morning
resolved to go to the ship, and get such necessaries as I
most wanted. I prepared for the second voyage, by repair-
ing the raft; which enabled me to get from on board the
ship a further stock of tools, clothes, ammunition, &c.
Having landed my second cargo, I immediately made a
little tent^ and fortified it securely against any attempt from
man or beast; and then charging my fire arms, I laid down
and slept as comfortably as ever I had done at home.
Eleven days had elapsed since I had been on this island,
and as many times had I visited the ship. As I was making
the twelfth attempt, the wind increased. However, I ven-
tured at low water, and, with difficulty, reached the ship.
On rummaging the cabins, I found several necessaries, to-
gether with upwards of £36 in pieces of eight, which in
my present situation was of no value. However, I took
them, and perceiving the storm beginning to increase, I
hastened to shore. I rested well that night in my little
fortification, but perceived in the morning that the shig<
was lost..
Dreading there might be savages, and knowing there
were wild beasts in this island, I was under great anxiety,
and continually revolving in my mind various methods of
insuring safety. Sometimes I thought it most prudent to
dig a cave; at others, that it would be most eligible to erect
a tent; the result was, I resolved to do both. My present
situation being inconvenient, I sought for a better, and soon
found one. It was a small plain near a rising hill, the
front steep. On one side the hill was a hollow place, re-
sembling the entrance of a cave. Before this place I deter-
mined to pitch my tent. This place was above a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, with an easy descent
each way to the sea-side. After this I drew a semi-circle,
about ten yards in diameter, and then drove a row of stakes
within six inches of each other; and, by the help of my
cables, and other materials I had brought from the ship, I
attempted a sort of regular fortification, which was impreg-
nable against any sudden attempts either of savages or wild
beasts. For better security, I had no doors, but got in and
out by a ladder, which I made for the purpose. Here I de-
posited my stores, and continued to work. I made a cellar,
and further strengthened my fortification by the earth and
stones I dug out of the rock. Considering myself now as
the king of the island, I every day took out my gun, and
killed whatever appeared to me to be eatable. The island
produced a great number of goats. I shot one as she was
suckling her young. Her kid followed me to the fortifica-
tion ; I lifted her over the pales, and endeavoured to pre-
serve her; but that proving impossible, as she refused her
food, I killed her for my own eating.
According to my own account, it was the 30th of Sep-
tember when I landed on this island. About twelve days
after, fearing I might lose my reckoning, or forget the
Sabbath, being in want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved on
a post, in large letters, which I set up in form of a cross,
on the identical spot where I landed : 6 I came on shore
September 30th, 1650/ On each succeeding day I cut a
notch on this post, and that for Sundays twice the length of
the others, and the notch for the first day of the month twice
as long as the notch for Sundays. Thus I kept my account
of time. This labour, however, I afterwards found was
13
unnecessary; when, upon rummaging the effects belonging
to the carpenter, gunner, and mate, 1 found myself supplied
not only with a regular book, pens, ink, compasses, and
other mathematical instruments, but also with a Bible, and
several other English books, which I preserved with the
utmost care; there was also a dog and two cats on board
the ship, which I made joint tenants with me in my fortifi-
cation. A whole year elapsed before I had completed my
habitation. When the business was finished, my fears in
consequence greatly abated, solitude became less disagree-
able, and I bent my thoughts to the contrivance of means
for rendering my desolate situation agreeable at least; and
to attain this I compiled the following journal:—
Sept. 30, 1650.—Forced by shipwreck on this island :
next day spent in reflecting on my hopeless condition, which
afforded no prospect but the worst of deaths, or being de-
voured by wild beasts.
Oct. 1.—Discovered the ship driven on shore; and, when
the storm abated, I immediately waded over the sands, and
got on board. To the 14th of this instant was spent in
making voyages to and from the ship.
Oct. 20.—My raft ran aground, and my goods were in
great danger; but I saved most of them.
Oct. 25.—Blew a storm and rained hard. The ship was
dashed in pieces.
Oct. 26.—Wandering about to discover a place to fix my
abode. Towards evening found a rock, where I judged I
might erect a wall and fortification.
Nov. 1.—Placed my tent by the side of a rock.
Nov. 3.—Shot two wild fowl, which proved good meat.
In the afternoon began to make myself a table.
Nov. 4.—Began to live regularly. In the morning
walked; afterwards worked till about two; after dinner
slept an hour or two, the weather being very sultry.
Nov. 5.—Went out with my gun and dog. Saw a great
flock of wild birds, and was terrified at the sight of some
enormous seals which I beheld on the sand. Upon seeing
me, they retired to the sea.
Nov. 9.—Finished my table. From the 7th to the 12th
(weather fair) worked hard. I rested upon the 11th, which
according to my calculation was Sunday.
Nov. 13.—Stormy and hot weather, with thunder and
lightning.
Nov. 14.—Made ^provision to secure my powder, which I
perfected on the 15th.
Nov. 17.—Began to dig upon the rock, but was pre-
vented for want of proper implements.
Nov. 18.—Found a tree, the wood of which was very
hard; and of that, with the utmost difficulty, made a kind
of spade; in doing which I almost spoiled my axe, which,
in my situation, might have been attended with very fatal
consequences.
, Nov. 23.—Spent my time from this to the 1 Oth of Decem-
ber in finishing my cave<.
Dec. 10.—Had no sooner finished my habitation, but
part of the roof fell in. It was a mercy I did not perish in
the ruins.
Dec. 27.—In my walks I met some goats; shot one and
lamed another. In a short time it got well, and was so tame
that it followed me like a dog, which induced me to try to
tame these wild animals, in hopes of procuring a stock to
live upon when my powder should be all expended.
Dec. 28 to 30.—Sultry weather : obliged to keep in.
Jan. 1.—Though sultry weather, necessity compelled me
to go out with my gun. Found goats in the vailies- They
were too shy, could kill none of them.
Jan. 8 to 13.—Found great numbers of fowl resembling
English pigeons. I shot some of them, which proved very
excellent food. As I was rummaging among my moveables
a bag came to hand, which had probably been made use of
to hold corn for the fowls in the ship. I proposed to use it
to hold powder, shook out of it the dust and loose corn upon
one side of the rock. Some days before it rained very harti.
The month following, to my great surprise, I discovered
something spring up very green. I went daily to view it,
and saw several ears of green barley, of the very same size
and shape with that of England. Amazed at this unex-
pected crop, I thought Providence had provided purposely
for my subsistence. My eyes soon after observed some
rice stalks extremely flourishing; from this I concluded
there was more com on the island. After several days fruitless
search, I recollected shaking the bag on the very spot
where those blades were growing. June was nearly ex-
pired before these ears grew ripe, when I laid them up
carefully, hoping that I should one day reap the advantage.
April 26.—Finished my ladder. I began now to flatter
myself that I was pretty well secured. But alas! in what
can mortals place security ? As I was one day sitting in my
cave, there happened a sudden earthquake, and the roof of
my little fortress came tumbling on my head. I ran to my
ladder, and got out just time enough to see the top of a huge
rock fall into the sea. Horror seized me, which was still
increased by the evident approach of a violent tempest.
This lasted three hours, and was succeeded by a rain that
deluged my habitation. Concluding I had chosen a bad
situation, I resolved to search for a better.
April 29, SO.—Spent in choosing my new abode.
May 1.—Walking by the shore, I found a barrel of gunT
powder, and divers pieces of the ship, which the violence of
the late storm had thrown on the sand.
June 1.—Strolling by the sea, I found a large turtle.
Jane 17.—Spent in cooking it; found in it seventeen
^ggs, and the flesh the most delicious meat that I ever
tasted.
June 18.—I staid within, being continual rain, with wind
and lightning.
From the 19th to the 27th, very bad with an ague; the Jit
frequently continued eight or ten hours.
June 27.—-Beganto recover; but my nights Were restless,
dreaming continually of ghosts and spectres.
June 28.—Slept well, which much refreshed me.
June 30.—Ventured out; killed a fowl resembling a
brand goose. In the evening repeated my medicine.
July 4.—Walked out with my gun, and being recovered,
resolved to make a tour through my dominions.
July 15.—Entered on my progress. Found a little run-
ning brook, behind which were fertile meadows; in which
I discovered tobacco, sugar-canes, and aloes, with several
other plants. Proceeding further up the country next day,
found it abounded with trees, with a great quantity of melons
and grapes. At the approach of night, I placed myself se-
curely in a tree, and for the first time ventured to sleep out
of my habitation. Next morning I proceeded a few miles
further, and finding plenty of fine fruit, resolved to provide
myself with a large stock. I soon procured a sufficient
quantity of grapes, and various sorts of fruit.
July 18.—I returned again. This place was so pleasant,
that I made a bower, or country house, which took up the
remainder of the month. Here I dried my grapes, which
I took home for a winter stock.
Aug. 14.—The rain* set in with great violence till the
middle of October. I could only go out twice ; the first
time I shot a goat, the next day found a large turtle.
Sept 30.—Counting the notches on my post, they
amounted to 365 *, this I concluded to be the anniversary
• of my landing. *I returned God thanks for my miraculous
preservation ; went to my bed, and slept soundly. Judging
tne season to be proper, I sowed about thirty stalks of bar-
ley and twenty of rice, which I had saved. In due season
the crop answered my most sanguine expectation.
On the return of fair weather, I went to my bower, which
I found uninjured. I renewed my resolution of surveying
my whole kingdom; and taking my dog, gun, and other
necessaries, proceeded on my journey*
Having passed the vale where my bower stood, I came
within sight of the sea, lying to the west. From hence I
discovered land, which I supposed to be that which lies be-
tween Spanish America and the Brazils, remarkable for
being inhabited by cannibals.
The part of the island I was now in abounded with par-
rots, one of which I took home; but it was long before I
could tame it, or teach it to speak. There were numbers of
hares and foxes, and plenty of grapes and other fruit. I
travelled about ten miles a day, being more intent in making
discoveries than expediting my journey.
Having made several observations, and fearing a return
of the wet weather, I resolved to retreat homewards. In
my return, my dogetufned out a kid, which I took to my
bower, in hopes of raising a breed. I arrived at my castle
in about a month from my setting out, when I resolved to
allow myself a week for refreshment. On going to my
bower for my kid, I found it in a starving condition. The
poor animal seemed grateful, and followed me to my castle,
where I kept it.
Sept. 30.—The anniversary of my third year, and return
of the wet season. I kept within, and offered up my most
grateful thanks to the Almighty for my preservation.
On viewing the land I had sown, I was comforted by the
prospect of a plentiful crop. Some land which lay behind
my castle, appeared to me to be proper for the purpose of
tilling. I hedged it in, therefore, to secure it from the ver-
min ; and taking such other methods for the improvement
of it as my circumstances admitted, was rewarded by an
ample increase, which not only enabled me to make my
bfead, but from its prospect of continuance, encouraged me
to eat it without dread of future want.
My fourth anniversary returned, which I celebrated with
my former solemnity and devotion; and being now rendered
something easy in my circumstances, my mind ever active,
began to form new projects. I now began to experience
very sensibly, some of the misfortunes attendant on a deso-
late situation. My biscuit was nearly exhausted, my clothes
and linen worn out, excepting shirts, and my paper quite
gone. I supplied my want of clothes, in some measure, bjT
the help of goat skins. Of these I made myself a cap, a
waistcoat, and a pair of open-knee breeches, with the hair
on the outside.
Five years had elapsed, in which I effected nothing worth
relating, except the making a canoe, with a view to discover
the circumference of my island; and in the 10th year of my
reign, Nov. 16, my voyage commenced, which I was eager
to pursue, but had made little progress before I found rea-
son to repent, for a current drove me out so far to sear that
I despaired of ever returning. By a fortunate change of
the wind, however, I was driven back to my old island,
where I waded to shore, and, being greatly fatigued, laid
me down to rest.
Having taken a comfortable nap, I laid up my boat in a
creek, and taking my gun, &c. retired to my bower; and
endeavoured again to take repose; but was quickly sur-
prised by a voice exclaiming, 4 Poor Robin Crusoe! where
have you been, poor Robin Crusoe ?' Gazing round in my
confusion, I saw my parrot sitting in the hedge, and was
convinced it was she who had called me. On calling her,
she perched on my finger, seemingly rejoiced at my return.
Ruminating on the advantages I should reap if I could
by any means take goats alive, and bring them to domestic
tameness, the idea occurred of making pitfalls, and baiting
them with corn. The scheme succeeded, for on making
the experiment, I caught an old he-goat, and one male and
two female kids. The old one escaped through superior
strength, but I conveyed the young ones home. I then en-
closed a small piece of ground, and treating them with gen-
tleness, they soon became very tame. In less than two
years, my stock increased to forty-three, by which means I
obtained a good supply both of meat and milk; which made
my life so happy that I seldom longed for liberty.
One day, while I was making an observation, I dis-
covered a boat at a great distance, but could not discern
what she was. After some time she came on shore on the
south-west, when I soon discovered they were savages.
After they departed, I examined the place of their landing ;
it was covered with the mangled scraps of human bodies;
there was also a circle made, in the centre of which there
had been a fire, about which it was probable they had
either sacrificed, or eaten the victims who had fallen in
their way.
As I was cutting wood one day to make charcoal, I ob-
served a large cavity, and on my nearer approach, perceived
two large eyes staring, as I thought, at me. Much sur-
prised, I ran back; but on recovering myself, resolved to
unriddle the mystery. I therefore returned, and found what
my fears had so much magnified, was nothing more than a
poor old goat in the agonies of death. Being now easy in
my mind, curiosity inclined me to make observation of the
place; and next day I returned, with six large candles of
my own making. After I had squeezed through the narrow
entrance, I was clear of all difficulty, the roof being more
elevated; and approaching farther, found myself in a most
beautiful grotto. The walls and roof bespangled with natu-
ral chrystals, reflected millions of lights from my candles,
charming to behold. But what pleased me most was, the
difficulty of access, which made me conclude it would be
an excellent hold against any surprise from the savages. I
therefore brought hither, with the utmost expedition, .a
Quantity of arms and ammunition. I began now, about my
twenty-third year, to experience some degree of happiness ;
it was alloyed indeed by the death of my dog. In the
month of December, as I was walking out early one morn-
ing, I observed, about two miles from the shore, near the part
where I had seen the savages, a great light. Horribly afraid
lest they should discover me and destroy me, I hastened to
my castle, and put myself in a posture of defence. Ascend-
ing, soon after, the top of the rock, I discerned, through my
glass, nine of them naked round a fire, feasting, as I con-
jectured, on human flesh. On viewing the place after they
were gone, the sight of human limbs mangled and torn,
raised my indignation to such a pitch, that I determined, at
the peril of my life, to rescue one of the savages from these
devouring cannibals; and flattered myself that by so doing,
I should win his affection, and incline him to be useful to
me.
It was a full year and a half before an opportunity
offered; when, early in the morning of the 23d of April, I
discovered five canoes on shore on my side of the island, the
crews of which were landed and concealed, but I could not
tell where. The sight of so many boats excited my utmost
dread, from the consideration of the number they might
have brought; and, arming myself, I went to the top of my
prospect-hill, frome whence I observed about thirty of them,
some feasting, some dancing round a lire with the most
hideous contortions, and others dragging two unhappy men
on shore, one of whom they knocked down, and, after man-
gling, miserably devoured. The other stood seemingly in
the utmost horror, expecting the same fate. On a sudden,
however, he ran, made towards a small creek, and took to
swimming. Two of the cannibals swam after him; and the
fugitive, as soon as he got out of the water, ran towards my
grove.
I resolved to make the best use of this opportunity, and,
snatching my gun, ran a shorter way, and put myself between,
the pursuers and their prey. The poor creature I intended
to save, was astonished at my appearance, but, upon my
beckoning, he stopped. The first of his pursuers I knocked
down with the butt-end of my piece, and, perceiving the
other taking aim at me with his arrow, I let fly, and killed
him. The flash and report of my gun struck the astonished
Indian with horror. I made signs to him to come to me,
which he obeyed through fear; throwing himself at my feet,
and putting one of my feet upon his head, which is their
sign of submission, and acknowledgment of perpetual
slavery. Upon which I gave him, by tokens, every en-
couragement. The cannibal I had knocked down, being
something recovered, sat upright, which greatly terrified my
poor slave; but I appeased his fears, by presenting my
musket at the devourer. The Indian, however, made signs
not to fire, but to lend him my sword, which I accordingly
did; when he ran to his enemy, and, with one dexterous blow,
severed his head from his body, and laid it in triumph at my
feet. My new servant was greatly astonished that I could
kill at a distance without a bow, and expressed a strong de-
sire, by signs, to examine the body. I then took him to my
cave, and after he had eaten, 1 permitted him to lie down
on some straw, and repose himself. I was now at leisure
to view him, and thought him one of the handsomest Indians
I had ever beheld. In about an hour after, as I was at-
tending my goats, he came and prostrated himself, putting
my other foot on his head as a confirmation of his perfect
submission.
Next morning I took him out with me, and made him un-
derstand that I should name him Friday, in honour of the
day I effected his deliverance. Finding, by an observation
from the top of a hill, that the barbarians were departed, we
reposed ourselves that night in the castle; and the next
morning, having armed myself, I took my man with me,
and went to view the scene of their cruelties. It was ren-
rendered very horrible by the bodies which were lying
upon it.
On returning to my castle, I made the best shift I could
to clothe my man, who did not seem much to thank me,
having never been used to the confinement of dress; but
in a lew days they sat easy, and he appeared very well
pleased. My next endeavour was to contrive a lodging
that might be comfortable to him, without risking my own
safety. I built him a small tent between the two fortifica-
tions, and secured myself every night, so as effectually to
prevent a surprise; a caution which was unnecessary, as I
found him on trial a very faithful and affectionate servant.
I had now two mouths to feed, and found it necessary to
give my new servant some employment: this the poor fel-
low seemed conscious of, and performed his business with
diligence.
Friday, by my instructions, had now acquired Englisi
enough to be very conversable. I entertained him with I
relation of my exploits, and alleviated his terrors by exl
plaining the nature and properties of gunpowder, and teaclil
ing him to shoot. He appeared very proud of a knife I hal
given him, so I made him a present of a hatchet, which hi
hung to his belt, and placed his habiliments in such a man!
ner that he made a very romantic appearance. I then too]!
him to the place, and showed him the wreck of my boat!
He viewed it very attentively for some time, and then said,
" O master! me see such a boat come to my nation."—
Conjecturing that poor Friday alluded to some European
boat which had been driven thither by distress, I inquired
as to its make, and what if contained. He replied eagerly,
w O master ! me save white mans from drown. Yes, yes,
boat full of white mans.1' I inquired their number. He
counted on his fingers seventeen. I asked if they escaped
alive. To which he replied, " Yes, master, all alive, live
among my countryman." I asked him how it happened
they did not eat them. His answer was, < No, no, my
nation, t'other nations; no eat mans, they make brother
with them ; but if mans make war they fight.' He then in-
timated, that his own, and an adjoining nation, did not eat
men, except such as they took in acts of hostility, whom
they deemed lawful prizes in right of conquest. Judging
that crossing to the continent, and treating with the white
men Friday had alluded to, might be a means of facilitating
my return, I applied assiduously to the building of a canoe,
which, by the active assistance of my man, was launched
in six weeks; and at the end of six months we bad fitted
her with mast and sail; so that the only difficulty was
how to instruct my companion to be useful in navigating
her.
I now repeated the anniversary of my landing for the 27th
year With greater solemnity than usual, excited thereto by
sincere gratitude for the long continuance of divine pre-
servation.
Prudence required the continuing of my course of hus-
bandry, notwithstanding I had formed hopes of a speedy
departure. Having secured my corn, and the rainy season
letting in, we retired to our dwelling1, determined, about
December, to attempt a voyage to the continent. The rains
being somewhat abated, I despatched Friday one morning to
the shore in search of a turtle. He returned speedily, and
in the utmost fright exclaimed, ' O, master, master, bad
news, four canoes upon coast, come to look for poor Friday;
kill you as well as me. Mo fight, me obey orders, me lose
last drop of blood for you.' There was now no time to be
lost. We loaded our arms, and put ourselves in the best
posture of defence. I then mounted a hill, to make a dis-
covery, and perceived there were nineteen savages, and
three prisoners, who, from the manner in which they were
treated, seemed destined to be devoured. Amongst the pri-
soners was a white man: this increased my detestation, and
urged me to attempt his rescue, which I determined to effect,
or perish in the attempt. Having instructed my man to fol-
low my example, we approached them unobserved, and took
aim so well, that we killed four, and wounded two or three
more. The savages were struck with amazement at this un-
expected salute. We took the advantage of their conster-
nation, and poured in a second volley with such effect, that
we killed two more and wounded several. They became
frantic, and ran about making violent contortions and yel-
lings. I ordered Friday to take the loaded musket, and
follow me; and, while the panic was strong upon their minds,
we showed ourselves boldly, and rushed impetuously in upon
them, making a great shout. They fled with the utmost pre-
cipitation. We immediately unbound the victim. I in-
quired, in Portuguese, who he was? He replied, in Latin,
that he was a Spanish Christian, thanked me in the strongest
manner for his release, and was going to recite his misfor-
tunes; but I judged it better to defer it, and said, < We will
talk when more at leisure, the present time must be employed
in fighting.' After having refreshed him, I furnished him
with a sword and pistol, and bid him do his best. He
manifested great courage. We pursued the barbarians so
vigorously, that out of twenty-two, not above four got into
their canoes; and those I determined to destroy, if possible.
^Accordingly I leaped into one of them, and commanded
<\riday to follow. My eyes were immediately shocked with
- sight of another devoted object. I unbound him, and
|^d him up, but he could not stand or speak. I ordered
 Friday to speak to him in his own language, and assure him
of our friendship. He did so. And now, reader, judge, if
you can, with what emotions the soul of poor Friday must
have been agitated, when he discovered that the object of
his care was his own father. With some difficulty we got
both these unfortunate men to my castle, where I contrived
a tent for their reception; and as they were very weak, my
man was immediately employed in killing a kid to make
them broth. After dinner I sent him to bring home the arms
we had left behind, lest they should fall into the hands of my
other enemies.
I now renewed my intention of taking a voyage to the
continent. Friday's father assured me 1 should meet with
good treatment from the natives; and the Spaniard offered
to go over with him before hand, to settle matters for my
reception; and both agreed to take an oth of fidelity to me.
I therefore despatched my two ambassadors, after having
furnished them with provisions and ammunition.
About a fortnight after their departure, as I was one
morning ruminating with great anxiety, Friday ran hastily to
me, and exclaimed eagerly, < They are come! tbey are> come!'
I instantly rose, and perceived, at about a league and a halt,
a boat standing in for shore. By the help of my glass, I
soon discovered they were not my ambassadors; but conjec-
tured they belonged to a ship anchored at some distance,
which appeared to be English built. It was not long before
the boat arrived, and tour men leaped on shore bringing two
with them, who appeared by their gestures to be prisoners,
and to be entreating passionately for preservation, t riday
observing it, cried out, < O master, you see English mans
eats prisoners as well as savage mans.' I soon pacified the
poor fellow's mind as to that point, but could not easily quiet
my own; for there was an appearance of barbarity which I
could not at that instant account for; prudence forbade my
approaching nearer.
While I was lamenting my want of power to assist the un-
happy men, my mind was relieved by discovering that the*
spared their lives, and contented themselves with leavu-
them to wander in the island, while they themselves.
 25
bled abroad seemingly with a view to make observations.
Considering that I had desperadoes to deal with, it appeared
most prudent to defer making any attempt till night, when
I should be favoured by the darkness, and they would be
weakened by the fatigues of a sultry day, and want of rest.
Waiting, therefore, till I judged the sailors were taking
their repose, I approached the two unhappy men, who were
sitting disconsolately under a tree. Asking them in Spanish
what they were, they startled; and, surprised at my extra-
ordinary dress, endeavoured to shun me: but on my ad-
dressing them in English—' Don't be afraid; you have a
friend nearer you than you imagine ; acquaint me with your
distress, and I will endeavour to serve you;' one of them
replied, ' Sir, my story would be too long: to be brief, I
was master of the ship which lies yonder at anchor : my men
mutinied; and we think it a favour that they spared our
lives, and put that passenger and myself on shore, though
we may, perhaps, perish here for want of necessaries.' I
asked them if they had any fire-arms. < Only two fusees;'
said the master, < and as one of them is left in the boat, if
the two villains who are left with it could be secured, we
are well assured that the rest would return to their duty.'—
For their greater safety, I took them farther into the wood;
and we resolved on an immediate attack. The two men
fired, and fortunately killed the ring-leader, and wounded
another; the rest cried for quarter, which was granted, on
swearing obedience to the master that they would exert
their endeavours to recover the ship. With this they com-
plied.
As, however, little faith could be reposed in men who
had already betrayed their trust, I advised the captain to
keep them bound till we could recover the ship, which,
having at length effected, nothing remained for further con-
sideration but how to dispose of our prisoners. After ma-
ture deliberation, we resolved to leave them in possession
of the island, and that I should return with the captain to
England. The captain was grateful, and considered me as
tiis deliverer. Taking with me poor Friday, my money,
my parrot, &c. on board, we set sail December 12, 1686,
and landed in England the 11th of June, the year follow-
B
ing, to,my, great happiness^ paying, been absent thirty-five
years,,,,, . . f ;. • • -  .- .;„ - , , _, >_f. '• - u,;;, .,,.
W&en I had, refreshed myself, I began to consider the
state of my aifairs, and to make, the proper enquiries. I
feund, the widow of my first captain living, but very poor.
?Itravelled soon after into Yorkshire,; where I learned that
my family in general were dead, o? so dispersed, that it. was
in vain to seek them, and that no provision had been made
for me.',
•y On meeting with these disappointments at home, I re-
solved to embark with my man Friday, for Lisbon, in quest
of the Portuguese captain, who took me on board on the
coast of Africa, in order to inquire after my plantation at
the Brazils. I had the good fortune to find him, and to
ileaiJii that it had been so well managed, that I was worth
$40,000 sterling!—Being now possessed of fortune, I re-
solved to return to my native country. By the advice of the
captain, I pursued my route by land. This measure had like
to have, been attended, with fatal consequences to me and
those who travelled with me:—A deep snow happening to
fall, the wolves and bears quitted the woods, and attacked
us many times, though we were more than twenty in num-
ber; but happily we kept them off. Nothing farther re-
markable happened. After a short stay at-Paris,. we em-
barked, at Calais, and landed at Dover on January 14th,
where we put'up at aninnibr the night, and set. off the next
morning for the city of York, where I purchased an estate,
and soon after married an agreeable young woman, who,
,although she had nothing, but virtue to recommend her,
proved to me an exhaustless mine, owing to the,prudent
manner in which she managed my affairs. I had by her
two sons and one daughter, the latter of whom unconsciously
proved the death of her mother, who died in bringing her
into the world. The loss, of so inestimable a partner hung
heavy on my mind> and a settled melancholy was depicted on
my brow. Disgusted with the world, my old spirit of ram-
bling returned; and alter,settling my estate, I -set off for
London; where, reading in a newspaper that the Lovely
-Nan, Captain Crusoe, was on the point of sailing for the
Coast of Guinea, I resblvetf Wfifid out 4he captain, and
agree with him for my passage thitlfeir, but it is fmpdsiMle
to describe my astonishment,1 when, an finding the captkin
at his lodgings near Blackball} and entering into conver-
sation with him, I found him the only son of my brother.
As soon as our first emotions of joy at this unexpected meet-
ing were subsided, he informed me he had heard his father
sayj that on leaving the University, he had fallen into the
hands of same kidnappersj who forced him on board a* slave
ship ;f the captain of which sold him, together With several
others, to the Algerines; and a rich lady falling in love with
him^ soon after his captivity, they made their escape1 to-
gether to Jamaica, wherethey were married, and led a com-
fortable life for some years-, 6 but a contagious disorder,
which raged in the island,' continued my nephew, ' trnhap-
pily carried off my father and mother at the same time, just
as I had attained my 2^th year* Finding myself deprived
of the' only solace that could now render the island dear
tor ifte$ I»resolved to (Juiti it^ and accordingly purchased
the ^ship of which I am now captain, in which I have
only yet taken two voyages, one to Bilboa, arid the^ other
to'Lisbon.- ;'
My nephew having here fcnded his short narrative, we
settled etery thing relating to my.next expedition-, -in con-
sequence of which, he immediately gave orders for a framed
sloop to be made, and carried on board his ship;< observing,
that in-case I chose to stop any time at my island, the sloop
could be left on shore, and' put together whenever I thought
prober.* • These pbftits being settled, and every thing got
ready for our departure, I made my will; and leaving the
greater part of my fbrtune in the hands of a worthy gentle-
woman, who was* a friend of my late wife, T also appointed
her guardian Over nly children. , ''r>
'Matters being^arranged, I-went on board with my nephew,
accompanied by faithful Friday; and, taking also with me
several artificers, and a good cargo for the better stocking of
myuslan*!, we set sail on the 7th of January, 1699, with a
favouring gale. On the 20th in the evening, the man at
the helm galled out that heLsaw the flash, and heard the re-
port of a gun; upon which we all assembled on the quarter
deck, and looking a-head beheld a terrible light, at no great
distance from us; and as we knew by our reckoning, that
we were a considerable distance from land, we therefore
concluded it must be some ship on fire. We made towards
the light with all possible sail. At day-break, two boats
came along-side of us, full of men, women, and children;
from whom, on coming on board of us, we learnt, that the
vessel which we had seen on fire had blew up, and to which
they belonged, was a French ship of 300 tons burden, from
Canada; and that she had caught fire through the careless-
ness of the steersman. However, to prevent too great a con-
sumption in our provisions, we landed them shortly after at
Newfoundland, where they hired a bark to carry them all to
France, except a young priest and three sailors, who chose
rather to go with us.
We now directed our course S. S. E. when^ on the 14th of
March, in lat. 27, we saw a sail bearing towards us, which
had lost all her masts, and fired a gun as a signal of distress.
The wind being northerly, we soon came up with her, when
we were informed that she was called the Lively, of Bristol,
homeward-bound from Barbadoes; and that having been
driven out of their course by a violent stormy which lasted
several days, they were almost starved for want of provi-
sion ; upon which my nephew and myself went on board
the Lively, where we found three passengers, viz. a young
gentleman, his mother, and a maid servant, in one of the
cabins, nearly starved; indeed the mother, who had forqed
the son to eat the last morsel of bread they had in their pos-
session, died soon after our coming on board! With much
difficulty we restored the young gentleman and maid, who,
at their particular request, we took on board our ship; we
a}so gave the distressed crew what provisions we could spare,
and pursued our voyage. Getting at length in latitude 19,
with much difficulty we gained the south side of my island,
and cast anchor in the creek which lay to the north of my
fortification.
As soon as this was done, I called Friday, and asked him
if he knew where he was? He looked round, and instantly
recognizing the well-known spot, fell to clapping his
hands, and in a joyous accent exclaimed^ 6 O yes, O dere I
me see, me see V and continued to sing and dance about like
! a madman. I ordered the long-boat to be lowered, and a
white flag hoisted; upon which the young priest, Friday,
and myself, together with sixteen men, well armed, got into
the boat and rowed on shore; and on the 10th of April I
once more set foot on my American island. The first ob-
ject that met my sight on landing was the Spaniard, whom
I had sent over to Friday's nation. He no sooner saw me
than he uttered a cry of joy, and rushed into my arms. At
this moment Friday discovered his father, at a little distance
from my hut, and darted forward with the swiftness of an
arrow, he rushed on his father, whom he tenderly embraced :
but the most laughable part of his behaviour was on the en-
suing morning, when he took his father along the shore for
a walk, holding him by the hand as one child would another,
and every now and then putting into his mouth a lump of
sugar, a dram, a biscuit, or something nice, that he had
brought ashore for him.
As soon as our emotions had subsided, the Spaniard led
me to the hut I had formery occupied; the environs and
entrance to which had been so altered during my absence,
that I hardly knew it again. The Spaniard now introduced
me to his sixteen companions in the island; and they re-
ceived me with great politeness. We were now joined by
Friday and his father; and the Spaniards having set before
us such refreshment as the island afforded, my ambassador,
as I called the first Spaniard, gave me an account of the
transactions during my absence, in nearly the following
words:—'Having,' said he, c undertaken a voyage to the
Cahutamacs, according to your desire, Thurisko (Friday's
father) and myself, after a speedy passage, landed in safety
on the opposite continent, when I immediately repaired to
the quarter where my countrymen resided, who concluding
me dead, hailed my return with the loudest acclamations of
joy ; as did the Indians also, on account of Friday's father.
After a little consultation among ourselves, and weighing
your project in our minds, we concluded it would be more
advisable for us to come over to you; as your island being
so well stocked with timber, would soon enable us, by our
joint efforts, to build a vessel, strong and large enough to
vcarry us to one of the nearest European settlemets. Im»
b3
pressed with this idea, we borrowed two canoes from the
natives, under pretence^ of going on a fishing party ; in these
\ve rowed over directly to your island
* You may easily imagine the surprise we were in when
we found you were gone, and the island in possession of
strangers; who, as I learnt from two of the party, that ap-
peared better behaved than the rest, had picked a quar-
rel among themselves. Atkins immediately gave me the
letter you had left, at the same time declaring, in the name of
himself and his companions, that they Were resolved to pay
us every degree of respect which its contents enacted. Soon
after this, while I and the other Spaniards were cutting
wood, the two peaceable Englishmen came and informed us,
that unless we took them under our protection, they should
certainly be murdered by their rebellious countrymen, for
Will. Atkins* and two of his companions had attempted
to murder them, and set fire to their hut. In conse-
quence of this, (continued the Spaniard) I reprimanded
Will. Atkins and his companions when we met at supper.—
Will, starting up, cast an indignant look at me, seized hold
of my hat, which he took off my head, and twirling it in my
face, exclaimed with a grin, < And you, Jack Spaniard, you
shall repent taking their parts!'—' Aye, said another, and
have the same sauce too if you do not mend your manners.'
Upon this I ventured to remonstrate with them on the un-
justness of their proceedings towards their countrymen,
adding, that I hoped they did not wish them to starve; to
which Will. Atkins repled, with an oath, « That starve or
hot, it was all one to him, they should not build on his
island.'-—c Or if they like, they may be our servants,' added
another of the ferocious wretches. ' But how can you ex-
pect that, said I, you have not bought them, and therefore
have no right to expect their services;' < nor they to build
upon our island,' replied Atkins. < At that rate, continued
I, < we must be your servants too.'—< Aye, and shall too
before we've done with you,' muttered Will. Atkins, and
beckoning his companions to follow him, he left the hut,
without saying another word, as did also the other two in
compliance with his signal. Judging that they had gone
out to put some malignant scheme into execution, we pre-
pared to follow; but by the time we had got over the paling
of the fortification, they had set fire to the huts which be-
longed to the two Englishmen that were with us, and des-
troyed the little plantation which belonged to them. Enraged
at this act of atrocity, we attacked thera; and after a sharp
scuffle took away their arms, leaving them to shift for
themselves.
c At length, finding their ill behaviour had made us all
their enemies, and being fairly starved out, they came to beg
we would restore their arms, and admit them into our com-
munity as before; to which I replied, that the latter part of
their request should be instantly complied with, but our
general safety would require some further proofs of their
amendment, before their arms could be returned. I had no
sooner said this, than the spirit of rebellion broke out afresh,
and Will. Atkins, after spitting in my face, told me that I
and my countrymen should repent the favour we had shown
to the objects of their hatred, who also should that night
feel the force of their resentments, saying which, they left
the hut, uttering the most horrid imprecations. Soon after
the two Englishmen came to our hut, in order to seek
shelter from their enemies; and thus, for some time, did
these malicious rogues insult, with impunity, twenty harm-
less men, merely because our natural love of peace
prevented our punishing their temerity; nay, so good
was our clemency, that on their returning a few days
after, and swearing, in a solemn manner, to desist from
their atrocious conduct for the future, we gave back their
arms.
* Soon after this, one night as I lay in bed, I was awaked
by a confused din, as if a vast concourse of people had been
assembled together. Alarmed at this circumstance, I as-
cended the hill, and heard the voices of several men, and
perceived a great light, which seemed to proceed from a
large fire. Returning in haste, I waked my countrymen,
and sent off Thurisko to reconnoitre; who soon returned
with the intelligence, that two Indian nations, having been
engaged in a severe battle on the opposite shore, had landed
on our island, by chance, in order to devour their prisoners ;
in consequence of which, he had every reason to think
another battle would ensue; and he had scarcely ended his
relation, before the terrific yell, or warwhoop, proclaimed
the beginning of another conflict, which surpassed all the
engagements I ever beheld. At length they took to their
canoes, and continued a running fight to the opposite shore.
Soon after we repaired to the scene of action, where we
found 32 dead bodies, which we buried.
x For some time this horrid spectacle seemed to have
curbed the spirit of Will. Atkins and his associates; but it
wore off, and another quarrel took place of such a serious
consequence that we brought them to a trial; when leaving
the decision of the case to the two Englishmen, they sen-
tenced them to be hanged; however, considering that I had
owed my life to an Englishman, I mitigated their sentence,
and after setting before them the heinousness of their be-
haviour, I doomed them to be banished to a remote part of
the island: at the same time giving them a sufficiency of
grain, &c. to begin a new settlement with. However, this
new mode of life proved so irksome to them, that in a few
months they came with a flag of truce, and solicited an old
canoe, as they had determined to leave the island, and
seek their fortunes elsewhere. This we readily complied
with, and we saw them depart, to our pleasure, I assure
you.
* A month had barely elapsed before one of the English-
men came running to us, greatly frightened, exclaiming,
6 We are undone! There are men upon the island who are
not savages ?' Alarmed at this account we sallied forth, and,
to our no small astonishment, beheld Will. Atkins and his
companions coming towards us; who informed us, that
after two days' sailing, they reached land, but were deterred
from approaching by the warlike appearance of the natives;
however, coming at length to a cluster of small islands,
they attempted a landing at all events, where they met with
a courteous reception from the inhabitants, who, among
other acts of friendship, thinking they were men^eaters
as well as themselves, made them a present of three men
and five women, which they durst not refuse, for fear of
offending them. For some time they were at a loss to de-
cide what to do with this present; however, they resolved
to return to the island, and employ them in the cultivation .
of the plantation they had abandoned. Fearful that the in-
troduction of women would occasion quarrels, I per-
suaded them to cast lots for the sable beauties, when the
five Englishmen getting each of them a car a sposa, matters
mended considerably with us; and from that moment we
have united together in the social bands of peace.'
The Spaniard having ended his narration, I caused the
young priest to unite the Englishmen and their black ribs in
holy wedlock, at which time the maid servant, whom we had
saved from starving, was also married to one of the artificers
I had brought over with me; who, together with her young
master and the priest, resolved to end their days on the
island. At length having disposed of every thing to my wish,
I took an affectionate leave of my subjects, and returned on
board my nephew's ship, where I gave a dinner to the seven-
teen Spaniards and five Englishmen; and the next morning
my nephew set sail for his destined port
We arrived in the bay of All Saints, in the" Brazil, in
about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our
passage but this:—that about three days after we had sailed,
being becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E. N. E*
running as it were into a bay or gulph on the land side, we
were driven something out of our course, and once or twice
our men cried out, ' Land to the eastward;' but whether it
was the continent or islands we could not tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth and the
weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, covered towards
the land with something very black; not being able to dis-
cover what it was, till after some time, our chief mate going
up the main-shrouds a little way, and looking at them with
a telescope, cried out, it was an army. I could not imagine
what he meant by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily.
6 Nay, Sir,' says he, < don't be angry, for tis an army, and a
fleet too; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, and you
may see them paddle along, for they are coming towards us
apace.'
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my
nephew the captain; for he had heard such terrible stories
of them in the island, and having never been in those seas
before, he could not tell what to think of it, but said, two
or three times, we should all be devoured. ' I nrusteonfess,
considering we were becalmed, and the current set strong
towards the sho're^ I liked it the worse: however, I bade
them not to be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor as
soon as we came* so hear as to know that we must1 engage
them. - v';>;> '• •• '•' ' '   - "..)'.:
The weather Continued calm, and they came on apace to-
wards us: so I gave order to come to an anchor, and furl ail
our sails : as for the savages, I told them they had nothing
to fear but fire, and therefore they should get their.boats
out, and fasten them, one close by the headland the other
by the stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue in
that posture: this I did, that the men in the boats might be
ready with skeets and buckets to put out any fire /these
savages would endeavour to fix on the outside of the ship.
In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they
came up with us: but never was such a horrid sight seen by
Christians: though my mate was much mistaken in his cal-
culation of their number, yet when they came up we
reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six; some of them
had sixteen or seventeen men in them ; some more; and the
least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck
with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless
they had never seen before; nor could they, at first, as we
afterwards understood, know what to make of us; they
came boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go
about to row round us; but we called to our men in the
boats not to let them come too near them. This very order
brought us to an engagement with them, without our de-
signing it; for five or six of the large canoes came so near
to our long-boat that our men beckoned with their hands to
keep, them back, which they understood very well, and went
back ; but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board
us from those boats, and one of our men in the long-boat
was very much wounded. However, I called to them not
to fire by any means; but we handed down some deal boards
into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind of
fence, like waste boards to cover them from the arrows of
the savages, if they should shoot again.
About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body
astern of us, and so near, .as,that we could easily discern
what they were, though we could not tell their design; and
I easily found they were some of *my old friends, the same
sort of savages that I had been used to engage with; and in
a short time more they rowed a little, farther out to sea^ till
they came djr.ecjtly; broadside with us, and,then rowed down
strait upon us, till they came so near, that they could hear us
speak : upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they
should, shoot ;any more arrows, and made all our guns ready;
but being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out
upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his own language,
to know what they meant; which accordingly he did.—
Whether they understood him or not, that I knew not; but
as soon as he had called to them, si,x of them, who were in
the foremost or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from
us, and stooping down, shewed us their naked backs, just
as if, in English, saving your presence, they bade us kiss—:
whether this was a defiance or challenge we knew not, or
whether it was done in mere contempt, or as a signal to the
rest: but immediately Friday cried out they were going to
shoot! and, unhappily for him, poor fellow, they let fly
about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my inexpres-
sible grief, killed poor Friday; no other man being in their
sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three
arrows, and about three more fell very near him; such un-
lucky marksmen they were!
Enraged at the death of my old servant, I ordered the
gunner to fire his guns, and give them a broadside; which
he poured in upon them so effectually, that fourteen of their
canoes were sunk, and the rest being frightened, made a
retreat; compassion, however, got the better of my resent-
ment, and observing one poor feiiow swimming for his life,
I caused him to be taken up; but he proved stubborn, and
refusing to eat and drink, I ordered him to be flung over-
board, and hauled up again, which manoeuvre made him
more, communicative: and he inlbrmed us by signs, that
they were going to a great battle, when our ship catching
their attention, they had merely advanced to take a view of
us, and that they fyad shot at -us .to make greaf wonder.
We buried Friday in a decent manner, and soon after cast
anchor at the Brazils, where we fitted out a vessel with
provisions far my island, and then steered for the East
Indies.
From here we embarked on board a couple of barks be-
longing to the country; and arrived safe at Archangel,
from thence we arrived at Hamburg, where I sold my mer-
chandize. I then travelled over land to the Hague, em-
barked on board an English packet, and arrived in the Downs,
Jan. 31,1705.
I hastened to the city of York, where I learnt my chil- .
dren's guardian was dead, and they well settled in the
world. And now, in my 72d year, after having suffered
unparalleled hardships, know the value of retirement.
THE END.
