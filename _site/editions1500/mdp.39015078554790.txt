FOREWORD
IN the year 1719 an Englishman whose name
was Daniel Defoe wrote a very long story, which
he called "The Life and Surprising Adventures
of Robinson Crusoe:" His story was not designed
for children, and therefore it contained a great deal
of hard reading. There was much in it, however,
that was interesting to young people, and from
that day to this, the marvelous tale of Robinson
Crusoe has been a favorite with boys as well as
men. I have rewritten the story in words easy
for every child, and have shortened it by leaving
out all the dull parts.

I WISH TO BE A SAILOR
MY name is Robinson Crusoe.
I was born in the old city of
York, where there
is a broad river,
with ships coming
and going.
When I was a
little boy, I spent much
of my time looking at
the river.
How pleasant was the
quiet stream, flowing, always flowing, toward the
far-away sea!
I liked to watch the ships as they came in with
their white sails spread to the wind.
I liked to think of the strange lands which they
must have visited, and of the many wonderful
things they must have passed.

ii
I wished to be a sailor. I thought how grand
it must be to sail and sail on the wide blue sea,
with the sky above and the waves beneath. Noth-
ing could be pleasanter.
My father wanted me to learn a trade. But I
could not bear the thought of it. I could not
bear the thought of working every day in a dusty
shop.
I did not wish to stay in York all my life. I
wanted to see the world. I would be a sailor
and nothing else.
My mother was very sad when I told her.
A sailor's life, she said, was a hard life. There
were many storms at sea, and ships were often
wrecked.
She told me, too, that there were great fishes in
the sea, and that they would eat me up if I fell
into the water.
Then she gave me a cake, and kissed me. "How
much safer it is to be at home!" she said.
But I would not listen to her. My mind was
made up, and a sailor I would be.
When I was eighteen years old, I left my pleasant
home and went to sea.
12
I MAKE MY FIRST VOYAGE

I SOON found that my
mother's words were true.
A sailor's life is
indeed a hard life.
There was no
time for play on
board of our ship. Even in
the fairest weather there was much work to be done.
On the very first night the wind began to blow.
The waves rolled high. The ship was tossed this
way and that. Never had I seen such a storm.
All night long the wind blew. I was so badly
frightened that I did not know what to do. I
thought the ship would surely go to the bottom.
Then I remembered my pleasant home and the
words of my kind mother.
"If I live to reach dry land," I said to myself,
"I will give up this thought of being a sailor. I
will go home and stay with my father and mother.
I will never set my foot in another ship."
Day came. The storm was worse than before.
I felt sure that we were lost. But toward evening
13
the sky began to clear. The wind died away.
The waves went down. The storm was over.
The next morning the sun rose bright and warm
upon a smooth sea. It was a beautiful sight.
As I stood looking out over the wide water, the
first mate came up. He was a kind man, and
always friendly to me.
"Well, Bob," he said, "how do you like it?
Were you frightened by that little gale?"
"I hope you don't call it a little gale," I said.
"Indeed it was a terrible storm."
The mate laughed.
"Do you call that a storm ?" he asked. "Why,
it was nothing at all. You are only a fresh-water
sailor, Bob. Wait till we have a real storm."
And so I soon forgot my fears.
Little by little, I gave up all thoughts of going
home again.
"A sailor's life for me," I said.
My first voyage was not a long one.
I visited no new lands, for the ship went only to
London. But the things which I saw in that great
city seemed very wonderful to me.
Nothing would satisfy me but to make a long
voyage. I wished to see the whole world.
14

I SEE MUCH OF THE WORLD
find a ship to my
liking; for all kinds
of trading vessels
go out from Lon-
don to every coun-
is known.
I met an old sea captain
who had been often to the coast of
Africa. He was pleased with my talk.
"If you want to see the world," he said, "you
must sail with me." And then he told me that he
was going again to Africa, to trade with the black
people there. He would carry out a load of cheap
trinkets to exchange for gold dust and feathers and
other rare and curious things.
I was very glad to go with him. I would see
strange lands and savage people. I would have
many a stirring adventure.
Before ten days had passed, we were out on the
great ocean. Our ship was headed toward the
south.
The captain was very kind to me. He taught
15
me much that every sailor ought to know. He
showed me how to steer and manage the vessel.
He told me about the tides and the compass and
how to reckon the ship's course.
The voyage was a pleasant one, and I saw more
wonderful things than I can name.
When, at last, we sailed back to London, we had
gold enough to make a poor man rich.
I had nearly six pounds of the yellow dust for my
own share.
I had learned to be a trader as well as a
sailor.
It would take too long to tell you of all my
voyages. Some of them were happy and success-
ful; but the most were unpleasant and full of disap-
pointment.
Sometimes I went to Africa, sometimes to the
new land of South America. But wherever I sailed
I found the life of a sailor by no means easy.
I did not care so much now to see strange sights
and visit unknown shores.
I cared more for the money or goods that I would
get by trading.
At last a sudden end was put to all my sailing.
And it is of this that I will now tell you.
16
I UNDERTAKE A NEW VENTURE

I HAD grown very tired of be-
ing a sailor. I was
so tired of it that
I made up my
mind to try some-
thing else.
It happened that I
was then in Brazil.
I bought some land
there and began to open
a plantation. The ground
was rich, and it would be easy to raise tobacco
and sugar cane.
But I needed many things. I must have plows
and hoes and a sugar mill. Above all I must have
men to do the work on the plantation.
But neither men nor tools could I get in Brazil.
I sent to London for the tools.. I tried to buy
some slaves of the planters near me, but they had
not enough for themselves.
"We will tell you what to do," they said. "We
will fit out a trading vessel for Africa. We will
CRUSOE-
put aboard of it everything that you need. As for
your part, you shall be the manager of the busi-
ness; and you shall do the trading for us. You
need not put in a penny of your own."
"But how is that going to help me?" I asked.
"Listen, and we will tell you," they said. "With
the goods which we send, you will buy as many
black slaves as the ship will hold. You will bring
them here, and we will divide them equally. You
shall share with us, just as though you had paid the
money."
The plan pleased me very much. I figured that
each one of us would have thirty or forty slaves.
It was very foolish of me to go to sea again; but
the offer was so good that I could not say No.
The ship was soon fitted out for the voyage.
Her load was not very heavy. But there were
plenty of goods such as were most fit for trade.
There were boxes of red and blue beads, of bits
of glass, and of other trinkets. There were also
knives and hatchets and little looking-glasses. We
reckoned that each one of these would buy a slave.
The ship was to carry fourteen men besides the
captain and myself. She was as fine a little vessel as
ever sailed from the coast of Brazil.
18
I AM SHIPWRECKED

AT length all things were ready for the voyage,
and I went on board the ship.
It was just eight years to the day since I had left
my father and mother and my pleasant home in
good old York.
I felt that I was doing a foolish thing; but I
did not dare to say so.
The wind was fair. The sails were spread.
Soon we were out at sea.
For several days the weather was fine. The ship
19
sped swiftly on her way, and every one was happy and hopeful.
Then a great storm came up from the southeast
I had seen many a fierce storm, but never one so
terrible as this.
We could do nothing but let the ship drive be-
fore the wind. Day after day we were tossed by
the waves; and day after day we expected the ship
to go down.
The storm grew fiercer and fiercer. The men
gave themselves up as lost.
But on the twelfth day the wind went down.
The waves were not so strong. We began to hope
for our lives.
Early the next morning a sailor cried out, " Land!
land!"
I ran out of the cabin to look. But at that very
moment the ship struck upon a great bank of sand
over which the fierce sea was rolling.
She stopped short. She could not move. The
great waves dashed over her deck. All of us would
have been washed overboard if we had not hurried
back to the cabin.
"What shall we do?" cried the men.
"We can do nothing," said the captain, "Our
3O
voyage is at an end, and there is no longer any
hope for our lives. We can only wait for the ship
to break in pieces."
"Yes, there is one chance for our lives," cried the
mate. "Follow me!"
In the lull of the storm we rushed again to the
deck. One of our boats was still there.
We slung her over the ship's side. We jumped
aboard of her. We cut her loose, and floated away
upon the wild sea.
No boat could live in such a sea as that. But we
saw land ahead of us; and perhaps some of us
might be cast alive upon the beach.
This was our only hope.
The raging waves carried us nearer and nearer to
the shore.
We could see the breakers dashing upon the
great rocks. The land looked more frightful than
the sea.
Then all at once, a huge wave overset the boat.
We had no time to speak or think.
We were thrown out into the raging sea. We
were swallowed up by the waves.
21
I AM CAST UPON A STRANGE SHORE
THE next thing I knew
I was lying on the
beach and the break-
ers were rolling over
me.
Some wave, kinder than the
others, must have carried me there.
I got upon my feet and ran as fast as I could.
I saw another wave coming after me. It was as
high as a hill.
I held my breath and waited. In a moment the
wave was upon me. I could feel myself carried
farther and farther toward the dry land.
The water covered me. But I held my breath
and tried to swim.
The wave became smaller and weaker as it rolled
farther and farther up the long beach.
At last I could keep my head and shoulders
above water. I could breathe again.
I felt the ground under my feet. I struck out
with all my might for the dry land.
But now the water was rushing back from the
22
shore. I feared lest I should be carried out to sea
again.
I swam, I ran. I held on to the rocks. Then
another great wave came and lifted me high upon
the shore.
In another moment I was safe on dry land.
All worn out with the hard struggle, I lay down
upon the green grass. I looked up at the sky and
thanked God that I was alive and safe.
After I had rested a little while I arose and
looked around me.
Far out from the shore I could see the ship. It
was still lying where it had stuck in the sand.
The waves were dashing over it.
"How was it possible for me to swim so far?"
I asked myself.
Then I began to think of the men that were with
me. Had any of them been saved?
I walked along the shore for a mile or more. I
looked in every spot for some signs of my friends.
In one place I found a hat'; in another, a cap;
and in still another, two shoes that were not mates.
But of the men themselves I saw nothing. All
were drowned in the deep sea.
I FIND A STRANGE LODGING PLACE
IT was now late in the afternoon.
The sun was shining in the
bright sky. The storm was
at an end.
I began to look
around me, to see
what kind of place I was in.
Where shall I go?" I asked my-
self. "What shall I do?"
My clothes were still wet. I could dry them
only by sitting in the sun.
I had nothing to eat or to drink.
I had nothing about me but a knife, a pipe, and
a little tobacco.
How could I live on this strange shore without
shelter and without food?
The thought of this made me almost wild. I
ran this way and that, like a madman.
Then I sat down and cried like a child.
I never felt so lonely as at that moment. I never
felt so helpless and lost.
Soon I saw that night was coming on.
24
I thought: "What if there are wild beasts in
the woods? They will come out in the dark-
ness and find me here. And then how can I
save myself from them?"
A little way from the shore I saw a tree. It
stood all alone, with no other trees near it.
It was thick and bushy, with long thorns on its
branches.
I walked out to look at it.
To my great joy I found a spring of fresh water
bubbling out from among its roots.
I knelt down and took a long drink, for I was
very thirsty. Then I climbed up into the tree.
The branches grew very close together. I found
a place where I could rest, half sitting and half
lying, with no danger of falling.
With my pocket knife I cut a strong stick about
two feet long. This would be my weapon if any
beast should find me in the night.
It was now quite dark. The only sound that
I could hear was that of the waves breaking against
the shore.
It seemed so good to be on dry land that I forgot
every danger. I was so tired that I soon fell asleep.
Never have I slept more soundly.
25
I VISIT THE WRECK
WHEN I awoke it
was broad daylight.
The sun was up. The
sky was clear. The
air seemed soft and
mild. A fine day was
beginning.
It did not take me
long to come down
from my lodging place.
I looked out toward
the sea.
To my great wonder I saw that
the ship was now much closer to
the shore. The high tide had lifted
her off of the sand. It had carried her toward the
land and left her on a huge rock less than a mile
away.
I could see that the good ship stood upright and
was firmly wedged into the rock.
The waves had not broken her up, but her masts
had been snapped off, and all her rigging was gone.

26
The sea was quite smooth, and the tide was still
going out. Soon the beach was bare, and I could
walk a long way out.
I was now within a quarter of a mile of the ship.
As I looked at her, a sad thought came to my
mind. For if we had all kept on board when she
stuck in the sand, we would now have been safe.
But there was no use in thinking of what might
have been.
I waded out as far as I could, and then swam for
the ship.
As I came near her, I saw that she was lying
high out of the water. The part of the rock that
was uncovered rose steep and straight into the air.
There was no place for me to set my feet.
I swam round the ship twice. How could I ever
climb up her smooth sides?
I was about to give up, when I saw a small piece
of rope hanging down from the deck. It reached
almost to the water. How strange that I did not
see it at first!
I seized hold of the rope, and climbed hand over
hand to the deck.
I went into the ship's cabin. I looked all
through the unlucky vessel.
27
I MAKE ME A RAFT
THERE was a great
deal of water in the
ship's hold. But the
cabin and the store-
rooms were dry.
The boxes of food
had not been touched
by the water.
I was very hungry,
but I had no time to
lose. So I filled my
pockets with dry bis-
cuits and ate them as
I went about.
There were many
things on the ship.
They might be very useful to me if I had them
on shore. But there was no boat, and how could
I carry them there?
"I will make a raft," I said to myself.
There were several long pieces of timber on the
deck. I tied a rope to each of these so that it

28
would not float away. Then I dropped them, one
by one, over the ship's side.
After this I slid down my rope into the water,
and tied these timbers together. They formed a
framework that was strong and would not sink.
On the top of this framework I laid all the
boards I could find.
I had now a very good raft. It was large enough
to carry a great many things. All the time I was
building it I was planning how to load it.
In the cabin there were three strong boxes, such
as sailors use. These I emptied. Then I carried
them out and let them down upon my raft.
Of all the things on board, I would need food the
most. So I filled the first chest with bread, rice,
cheese, and a few pieces of meat.
I found also a small bag of grain, of which I took
good care. It was barley.
Then I began to look around for clothing, and
found enough to do for many a day.
While I was getting these together I happened
to see the carpenter's chest. It was full of tools.
It was hard work to get it on the raft. I lifted
and pulled, I pulled and lifted; and at last I had it
alongside of the other boxes. How tired I was .1 29
I CARRY SOME THINGS ASHORE

IT was now past noon, and the tide
was coming in. I could not stop to
rest.
"I have food, I
have clothing, I have
tools," I said to my-
self. "What do I
need next?"
Then I thought
of the wild animals
and wild men that I
might meet on the
shore. "How shall I protect myself from them?"
I said.
In the captain's room I found two good guns
with a bag of shot and a powderhorn. There were
also two old swords, very rusty and dull, and a pair
of big pistols.
By looking around, I found also three small kegs
of powder. Two of these were dry, but the other
was wet and good for nothing.
It took more than an hour to get all these safely
30
placed on my raft. I now had quite a heavy load,
and I began to wonder how I should take it to the
shore.
I had no oars nor any sail for my raft. But the
water was smooth, the tide was flowing in, and a
gentle wind was blowing toward the land.
I loosed the rope that held the raft to the ship,
and soon began my little voyage.
The tide was now so high that the dry land was
much farther away than when I came out. But the
raft floated smoothly along, and drew nearer and
nearer to the shore.
Just as I thought myself safe, I found that I was
entering a strong current which carried me into a
narrow bay far from my first landing place.
There the raft stuck fast on an ugly sand bar, and
was like to be tipped over. It was all I could do
to keep the heavy boxes from slipping off into the
water.
But the tide was still rising. Soon the raft
floated free and glided slowly along again with the
current.
In a short time I found that I was being carried
up into a little river with high banks on each side.
With a piece of plank for an oar I pushed the
raft toward the shore on my right. The water was
now so shallow that I could reach the bottom.
The raft floated slowly onward until it reached a
little cove into which I pushed it. The water there
was quite still.
I looked around for a place to land. But the
banks were steep, and if I ran one end of my raft
upon the shore, the other end might sink so low as
to slide all my goods into the water.
The best I could do was to wait till the tide was
at its highest. Then I might push a little farther
inland where the bank was somewhat lower.
This I did.
The tide rose higher and higher. At last, to
my joy, the water reached the top of the bank. It
covered a level spot of ground beyond.
I waited a little longer. The water on the level
space was a foot deep. The tide was beginning to
flow out.
With all my might I pushed the raft into this
shallow place. The tide ebbed fast. Soon the
raft was left high and dry on the land.
It was easy now to unload the goods and carry
them to a safe place.
I LEARN THAT I AM ON AN ISLAND
THE sun was still two hours high.
I was very tired after my day's work,
but I could not rest. I wanted
to know what sort of place I
was in. I wondered whether I
was on an island or on a
continent.
About half a mile from
the shore there was a large
hill. It was steep and high
and seemed to overlook
all the country.
I thought that if I could
get to the top of that hill
I might see what kind of
country I was in.
So I put one of the pistols in my belt, and one of
the guns on my shoulder. I also hung the powder-
horn from my neck and put a handful of small shot
in my pocket.
Thus armed, I set out for the big hill.
There were but few shrubs or trees in my way,
CRUSOE—3 33

and the walking was easy. In less than a quarter
of an hour I was at my journey's end.
The sides of the hill were not rough, but they
were quite steep.
Soon I was at the very top. What a grand look-
out it was!
North, south, east, west, the land and the sea
were spread out before me.
The sea did I say?
Yes, I was on an island, and the sea was all
around.
No other land was in sight except two small
islands and some great rocks that lifted themselves
out of the water.
I saw that my island was not very large. Per-
haps it was ten miles broad; perhaps it was twenty.
I had no good idea of distances.
There was no house nor sign of life anywhere.
There might be wild beasts in the woods; but I
was sure that no men lived there.
The thought of being alone on a desert island
made me feel very sad.
I should have been glad at that moment to see
even the face of a savage.
But I dared not stay long on the hilltop. I
34
hurried to get back to my raft before the sun
should go down.
At the foot of the hill I saw a great bird sitting
upon a tree. I thought it to be some kind of a
hawk and shot it.
The sound of the gun echoed strangely among
the rocks and trees. Never before had such a
sound been heard there.
I picked up the bird.
It was no hawk. It had no sharp claws nor
hooked beak. Its flesh was unfit to eat, and I
threw it away.
The sun had set and it was almost dark when I
got back to the inlet where my raft was lying.
I did not know where to go for the night, nor
where to find a resting place.
But the day being gone, there was no time for
thinking.
I made a kind. of hut with the chests and the
loose boards from the raft. Then I crept inside
and lay down to rest.
For a little while I listened to every sound.
At length I fell asleep and knew nothing more
until broad daylight the next morning.
35
I HAVE A STRANGE VISITOR

THE next morn-
ing, when the tide
was at its lowest,
I swam out to the
ship again.
There were still
many things on board
of it that might be useful to me in my island
home. I wished to save all that I could.
I climbed up the ship's side just as I had done
the day before.
Before looking for anything I made another raft,
just like the first one, but smaller. It was not so
easy to make, for I had used up all the best planks.
It was neither so large nor so strong as the first
raft.
In the carpenter's shop I found three bags of
nails and a grindstone. I found also a box full of
little hatchets and a small barrel of musket balls.
In the captain's room I found six or seven guns,
which I had overlooked before, and another keg of
powder.
36
All these things I loaded with much care upon
my raft.
Then I gathered up as many clothes as I could find;
also a spare sail, a hammock, and some bedding.
The raft was now quite full. The things were
not heavy, but they made a large pile.
When the tide turned for the shore, I cut loose
and was soon floating homeward.
I had found a good oar in the ship. This I used
as a paddle, and I had no trouble in guiding the
raft to the right landing place.
I looked to see if the goods were safe which I
had brought over the day before.
There, on one of my chests, I saw a strange
animal sitting. She looked like a wild cat.
As I went toward her, she jumped down and
ran a little way. Then she stood still.
I followed. She stood very firm and looked in
my face. She looked as though she had a mind to
get acquainted.
I pointed my gun at her, and shouted. But she
did not care for that.
I had a bit of biscuit in my pocket. This
I now tossed toward her. "Take this and be-
gone," I shouted.
37
Biscuits were not so many that I could well spare
any. But I spared the poor animal this little bit.
It rolled quite close to her nose. She smelled
of it and ate it. Then she looked up for more.
"Thank you, I have no more to give you," I
said.
Whether she understood me, I do not know.
But, with that, she turned and marched away.
I now set to work to get my second cargo on
shore. It was no easy task, and I had to make
many trips to and from the raft.
When everything was safely landed, I made me
a little tent with the sail and some poles that I
cut.
Then I put everything into the tent that needed
to be kept dry. The empty boxes, I piled outside.
They made a kind of wall around the tent, like the
wall of a fort.
"This will keep the wild beasts out," I said.
By this time the day was nearly done. I spread
one of the beds on the ground. I laid two loaded
pistols near its head, and one of the guns by one
side of it.
Then I crept in and was soon fast asleep.
I FIND A GREAT STORE OF THINGS
THE next day I went
to the ship again. This
I kept up for more than
a week.
Every day I brought
a load of things to the
shore.
At last there was noth-
ing left that one pair of
hands could lift. But I
do believe that if the fine
days had held out, I would have brought away
the whole ship.
You ask how I would have done that?
I would have cut it into pieces and brought one
piece at a time.
The last thing that I found was a secret drawer
in the cabin. In that drawer there was some
money.
A part of this money was in gold pieces —
"pieces of eight," we called them. The rest was
in silver.

39
I smiled to myself when I saw this money.
"O useless stuff!" I cried. "What are you
good for now? You are not worth picking up.
'This little old knife is worth much more. I have
no manner of use for you. Lie there, where you
are, and go to the bottom."
I was about to leave the cabin when I looked
around again. The bright pieces were so pretty
that I could not bear to leave them.
So I put them all in a strong bag and tied it
around my waist like a belt.
"It will not do to throw good money away,"
I said.
When I went up on deck the wind was blowing
hard. Dark clouds were beginning to cover the
sky. The waves were rolling high. A storm
was coming.
I saw that it was time for me to hurry back
to the shore.
I let myself down into the water and began to
swim. The sea was rough. The money was
heavy. It was all I could do to reach the
land.
I hastened home to my little tent.
The storm had already begun.
40
I BUILD ME A CASTLE

I LAY down on
my bed, with my
money and other
precious things
close at hand.
All night long
the wind blew and
the rain poured.
Early in the
morning I arose and looked out toward the sea.
The waves were rolling very high.
The ship was gone. The sea had swallowed
it up.
As I could make no more visits to the ship, I
now began to think of other things.
I was still afraid lest there were savage beasts en
the island.
Savage men, too, might come that way.
If any of these should find me, how could I
protect myself from them?
I must have a stronger house to live in. I
must build me a little fort or castle.
The place I was in was flat and wet. My tent
was on open ground and could be plainly seen
from a distance. There was no fresh water near it.
I must find a better place than this for my
castle.
A little way from the shore there was a rocky
hill. I went to look at it.
Halfway up the hill there was a large level
place, with a great rock rising behind it like the
side of a house.
I climbed up to the level place. There was but
one way to go, and that was by a steep and winding
path.
I found the place much larger than I thought.
It was more than a hundred yards long and almost
half as broad.
It was, indeed, a green field, or plain, with a
steep cliff rising up behind it. You must think of
it as a great shelf halfway up the side of the hill.
"Here," I said to myself, "is the place for my
castle."
It was no easy thing to carry all my goods up
the steep path to this level plain. I worked hard
for many days; but, then, there was nothing else
to do, and I must needs keep busy.
42
At one place on the side of the great rock there
was a break, or opening, like the door to a cave.
But there was no cave there.
Just in front of this break I began to build
my castle. First, I drew a half circle upon the
ground, with the opening at the center. The space
which it inclosed was about thirty feet across.
In this half circle I set up two rows of strong
stakes, driving them deep into the ground.
The rows were not more than six inches apart.
The stakes were about two inches apart and as
high as my head.
Then between and around these stakes I laid the
great ropes that I had brought from the ship.
Among these I twined the slender branches of
trees and long grapevines that I found in the
woods.
When all was finished I had a wall nearly six
feet high. It was so strong that nothing could
break through it.
I made no door in the wall. The only way in
which to get into the yard behind it was by going
over the top. This was done by climbing a short
ladder which I could lift up after me, and then let
down again.
43
How safe I felt now, as I stood inside of my
castle wall!
Over this wall I next carried all my riches, my
food, my tools, my boxes of clothing. Then, right
against the great rock, I made me a large tent to
shelter me from the rain.
Into this tent I brought everything that would be
spoiled by getting wet. In the middle of it I swung
the hammock that I had brought from the ship.
For you must remember that I was a sailor, and I
could sleep better in a hammock than on a bed.
The hollow place in the rock was just as I hoped.
It was, indeed, a large cleft or crack, filled only
with earth and. small stones.
With such tools as I had I began to dig the earth
and stones away. I carried them out through my
tent and piled them up along the inside of my wall.
In a few days I had made quite a cave which
would serve very well as a cellar to my castle.
I called the cave my kitchen; but when I began
my cooking I found it best to do most of that work
outside.
In bad weather, however, the kitchen was an
excellent place to live in.
44
I GO A-HUNTING
WEEKS and weeks passed before
my castle was finished.
I did not work at it all the time.
Almost every day I went
out with my gun to see
what I could find.
The very first day I
saw a flock of goats.
How glad I was!
But they were very
shy and very swift.
As soon as they saw
me they ran away in
great fright.
After that, I saw them nearly every day. But it
was hard to get near them.
One morning I saw an old goat feeding in the
valley with a kid by her side. I crept along among
the rocks in such a way that she did not see me.
When I was close enough, I raised my gun and
fired. The mother goat fell, being killed at once
by the shot.

45
It was a cruel deed, and I felt indeed sorry for
the poor beast. But how else should I find food
for myself in that lonely place?
The kid did not run away. It stood quite still
by its mother's side. When I picked up the old
goat and carried her to my castle, the little one
followed me.
I lifted it over the wall. I thought I would
tame it, and keep it as a pet.
But it would not eat. I could do no better than
kill it and use it for my own food.
The flesh of these two goats lasted me a long
time; for I did not eat much meat, and I still had
many of the biscuits that I had saved from the
ship.
About a month later I shot at a young goat and
lamed it. I caught it and carried it home. I
dressed its wounded leg, and fed it.
Its leg was soon as well and as strong as ever.
The little animal became quite tame and followed
me everywhere I went.
I thought how fine it would be if I could have
a whole flock of such creatures. Then I would
be sure of food when my powder and shot were
gone.
46
I KEEP MYSELF BUSY
AMONG the things that I brought
from the ship there were several which
I have not told you about. I will
name them now.
First I got from the
captain's desk.some pens,
ink, and paper. These
were afterward a great
comfort to me, as you
shall learn.
There were some
charts and compasses,
and three or four books
on navigation. These I threw in a corner, for I
did not think I should ever need them.
Among my own things there were three very
good Bibles, which I had bought in England and
had packed with my clothing.
And I must not forget the dog and two cats
that came to shore with me. I carried both the
cats on my raft with my first cargo.
As for the dog, he jumped off the wreck and

47
swam to the shore. He was my best friend for
a long time. He followed me everywhere. He
would run and fetch things to me as I bade him.
I wanted him to talk to me, but this he could
not do.
As for my pens, ink, and paper, I took the
greatest care of them. As long as my ink lasted,
I wrote down everything that happened to me.
But when that was gone, I could write no more,
for I did not know how to make ink.
I soon found that I needed many things to
make me comfortable.
First, I wanted a chair and a table; for without
them I must live like a savage.
So I set to work. I had never handled a tool
in my life. But I had a saw, an ax, and several
hatchets; and I soon learned to use them all.
If I wanted a board, I had to chop down a tree.
From the trunk of the tree I cut a log of the length
that my board was to be. Then I split the log
and hewed it flat till it was as thin as a board.
All this took time and much hard work. But I
had nothing else to do.
I made the table and chairs out of short pieces
of board I had brought from the ship.
48
Of the large boards which I hewed from trees, I
made some wide shelves along the side of my cave
or kitchen.
On these shelves I laid my tools, nails, and other
things.
I had a place for everything, and kept every-
thing in its place.
My cave looked like some stores you have seen
where a little of everything is kept for sale.
From time to time I made many useful things.
From a piece of hard wood that I cut in the
forest I made a spade to dig with. The handle I
shaped just like the handles you buy at the stores.
But the shovel part was of wood and would not last
long.
While I was digging my cave, I found it very
hard work to carry the earth and small stones
away. I needed a wheelbarrow very much.
I could make the frame part of this, but I did
not know how to make the wheel. I worked four
days at it, and then had to give it up.
At last I made me a kind of hod, like that which
masons use. It was better than a basket and
almost as good as a wheelbarrow.
CRUSOE — 4 49
I HAVE A GREAT FRIGHT

THE very next day
after my cave was fin-
ished a frightful thing
happened. I came near
losing everything and
my own life as well.
I will tell you about it.
I was busy behind my tent
when I heard a fearful noise above my head.
Before I could look up, a great load of earth and
stones came tumbling down.
It was a wonder that I was not buried alive.
I was scared, for I thought the whole top of the
cave was falling in.
I ran out and climbed over my wall. The great
rock behind my castle seemed to be shaking.
Stones and earth were rolling down its side.
"An earthquake! an earthquake!" I cried.
The ground shook. A tall rock that stood
between me and the seashore toppled over and
fell. The noise was the most frightful I ever heard.
There were three shocks about eight minutes
BO
apart. The strongest building you ever saw would
have been overturned.
I was so frightened that I did not know what
to do. I sat on the ground and could not move.
I could only cry, over and over again, "Lord, have
mercy on me!"
After the third shock was over I began to grow
braver. But still I sat on the ground, wondering
what would come next.
All at once the sky was overcast. Dark clouds
rolled over the sea. The wind began to blow.
A dreadful hurricane was at hand.
The sea was covered with foam. The waves
were mountain high. On the shore, trees were
torn up by the roots. If my tent had not been
well sheltered behind the great rock, it would have
been carried away.
The hurricane lasted fully three hours. Then
the rain began to pour down.
All this time I sat on the ground outside, too
much frightened to go back into my castle.
Toward night the rain slackened, and I ven-
tured over my wall. The tent was half beaten
down. So I crept through into the cave. I was half
afraid that even it would tumble down on my head.
I EXPLORE MY ISLAND
IT rained all that night, But in the cave every-
thing was warm and dry,
and little by little I lost
my fear.
The earthquake
and the hurricane had
done great damage to
my castle. I had to
work hard for many
days to put things to
rights again.
I had now been on the
island about ten months. In
all that time I had seen only a small part of it.
One morning I set out with my gun on my
shoulder for a long walk.
I went up the little river where I had first landed
with my rafts. I found that it was a very short
river. After about two miles, the tide did not flow
any higher; and above that, the stream was only a
little brook of fresh water.

52
Along the brook there were pleasant meadows,
covered with high grass.
In the dryer parts of these meadows I found
tobacco growing wild.
I looked for the roots of a plant which the
Indians use instead of bread, but could find none.
In one place, however, I saw many tall sugar
canes and some fair-looking plants of a kind that
was strange to me.
As I went back to my castle I wondered how
I could learn something useful about the many
objects I had seen. But I had never taken much
thought about such things, and now I had but little
chance to learn.
The next day I went up the same way, but much
farther.
Beyond the meadows I came to some beautiful
woods.
Here I found several different kinds of fruits.
There were grapevines covering the trees, and huge
clusters of ripe grapes were hanging from them.
I was very glad of this. I made up my mind to
come another day and gather some of this fruit. I
would dry the grapes in the sun, and have some
raisins.
53
Night came on while I was still in the woods, and
I could not do better than stay there till morning.
So I climbed into a tree and slept there quite well.
It was the first night that I had spent away from
home.
The next day I went on through the woods for
nearly four miles.
At last I came to an open space where the land
sloped to the west. The country was so fresh and
green that it looked like a big garden.
I went down into a pleasant valley where there
were many beautiful trees. There I found oranges,
lemons, limes, and citrons, besides many grapes.
I loaded myself with fruit and started homeward.
"I must come again and bring a sack," I said.
It was three days before I reached my castle. By
that time the fruit had lost all its flavor.
The next day I went back to the same valley. I
carried two small sacks to bring home my harvest.
But I found many of the grapevines torn down.
The fruit was scattered on the ground. Some had
been eaten. Some had been trodden to pieces.
A wild animal had been there. Perhaps it was
a goat, perhaps it was a larger beast. Perhaps
several animals had done the mischief.
54
I GET READY FOR WINTER

I WAS so much
pleased with the
valley I had discov-
ered that I spent
much of my time
there.
At last I built
me a small summer
house close by a
grove of orange
trees.
It was but little
more than a bower, made of the branches of trees.
I built a strong fence around it. This was
made of two rows of tall stakes with brushwood
between.
There was no gate in this fence, but only a short
ladder just as at my castle.
Here I sometimes stayed two or three nights
together.
I gathered about two hundred clusters of grapes
and hung them up to dry. In due time they made
55
the finest of raisins. I took them down and carried
them to my castle.
Thus little by little I gathered food for winter.
The winters there were not cold. But the rain
fell every day, and often all the day.
I had just finished my bower, and was beginning
to enjoy myself when the rainy season, or winter,
began.
What could I do but hurry back to my castle and
its dry, warm cave?
For weeks I could not stir out without getting
wet. My store of food began to grow small.
One day, in spite of the rain, I went out and
killed a goat. The next day I found a very large
turtle among the rocks.
This was all good luck, for I had now enough to
eat for many a day.
My meals were simple and plain.
For breakfast, I had a bunch of raisins and a bit
of biscuit.
For dinner, I had broiled turtle. I could not have
turtle soup, for I had no vessel in which to cook it.
For supper, I ate two or three turtle's eggs.
Although I was kept close indoors by the rain, I
was never idle.
56
Every day I worked at making my cave larger.
I dug far in, behind the rock, and made a fine,
large room there.
Then I made another door or way out, which
opened on the outside of my wall. So now I could
come into the castle through the cellar, or kitchen,
and without climbing the ladder.
This was much handier and easier than the other
way. But it did not seem so safe. I feared now lest
some wild beast might get into my house; and yet
the biggest animal I had seen on the island was
a goat.
Soon after this I put a roof over my whole in-
closure. I took a number of long poles for rafters
and laid one end of each on the wall, while the
other end leaned against the rock above the cave.
These I covered with boughs of trees, long grass,
and such other things as I could get. In this way
I made a very good roof which turned the rain and
kept everything dry.
My castle was now a very roomy place. It was
quite warm and dry even in the worst of weather.
57

IT was now just one year
since I was cast upon this lonely
island.
. Do you wonder how I had
kept an account of the time?
I will tell you.
A few days after the ship-
wreck it came into my mind
that I should lose track of
the days and the seasons, for
I had neither almanac nor notebook. It would
be hard always to remember the days of the week,
and I might even forget when it was Sunday.
So I set up a large post by my door. At the top
of this post I cut in large letters these words: —
I CAME ON SHORE HERE
SEPTEMBER 30, 1659.
Every morning I cut a little notch on the side
of the post under these words.
Every seventh notch was twice as long as the
rest, and this showed me that the day was Sunday.
58
Every thirtieth notch was longer still and
broader. This showed me that a full month had
gone by.
It was thus I made my calendar.
One morning I found, on counting up, that there'
were three hundred and sixty-five notches on the
post. I knew, therefore, that it was just one year
since my landing.
I kept this day as a solemn fast.
I sat in my castle and thought of the goodness
of God in thus keeping me alive and safe in the
midst of so many perils.
I humbled myself, and thanked him for his many
mercies.
For twelve hours I tasted nothing. When, at
last, the sun went down, I ate a biscuit and a
bunch of grapes and went to bed.
Having now been on the island a whole year, I
had learned that the seasons there were not the
same as in England.
They were not to be spoken of as spring,
summer, autumn, and winter. They were rather
to be called the wet season and the dry season.
Indeed, there were two wet seasons and two dry
seasons in the year.
59
I SOW SOME GRAIN

THE first wet season began
about the middle of February
and lasted till the middle of
April.
The first dry season began
about the middle of April and
lasted till the middle of August.
The second wet season began
about the middle of August
and lasted till the middle of
October.
The second dry season began about the middle
of October and lasted till the middle of February.
I could not have kept track of these things so
easily if it had not been for my calendar.
Just before the first rainy season began I was
one day rummaging among the shelves in my
cave.
There I found the little bag that I had brought
from the ship with some barley in it, as I have
already told you.
I lifted it; it was almost empty.
60
I looked inside. I saw nothing there but some
dust and chaff. The rats had been there, and
had eaten the grains of barley.
The bag would be useful for something else. I
took it outside and shook the dust and chaff upon
the ground. It was a sunny place, close by the
great rock.
About a month after this, I saw that something
green was starting to grow at that place. I won-
dered what it was. It could not be grass, for the
stalks were larger and stronger.
I had forgotten about the barley. But I took
care that nothing should break the stalks down.
They grew fast, and were soon as high as my
waist. Then I was surprised to see ten or twelve
heads of green barley come out.
You cannot think how glad I was. I remem-
bered, then, how I had shaken the bag of dust and
chaff over that very spot.
But there was another surprise for me. I noticed
in the wet ground a little nearer the rock some
other green plants. These were not so tall as the
barley stalks, and they did not seem to be the
same.
I watched them for several days. Then I saw
61
that they were stalks of rice. No doubt some grains
of rice had been in the bag with the barley, and
had fallen out with the dust and chaff.
You may be sure that I took good care of my
grain. As soon as the barley was ripe I harvested
it. There was only a handful or two; but I put it
away where no rats could get to it. I wished to
keep it safe and plant it again the next season.
I did the same way with the rice.
There was so little to begin with that it took
a long time to grow a big crop. It was not until
the fourth harvest that I could keep some of the
barley for bread.
I found that the best place to plant the grain was
not on the hillside, but in a moist spot not far from
my summer home.
One day, as soon as the wet season was at an end,
I made a visit to the country to see how my crops
were growing.
There I saw something that surprised me.
You will remember the fence that I built around
my summer house, or bower as I called it. It was
made of two rows of tall stakes, with brush between.
Well, I now found that the stakes were still
green, and that long shoots or twigs were growing
62
from them. Some of these branches were already
two or three feet long.
This pleased me very much. I cut and trained
the growing branches into just such shapes as I
wished.
They grew very fast, and soon the whole fence
was covered with green leaves. Then I trained
the long branches toward the top of a pole which I
set up in the center of my bower.
In a few months the whole inclosure was covered
with a green roof.
You cannot think how beautiful it was. The
place was shady and cool, the pleasantest spot one
could wish to have.
I did not know what kind of tree it was that
grew in this wonderful way. But I cut some more
stakes of the same sort and carried them home to
my castle.
I set these stakes, in a double row, about twenty
inches outside of my first wall. In a few weeks
they began to grow. They grew so fast that in
two years they covered the whole space in front
of my castle.
They were not only handsome to look at, but
they helped to protect my castle.
63
I MAKE A LONG JOURNEY
I HAD long wished to see the
whole of my island. So, one
fine morning, I set out to travel
across to the other
7) side of it.
Of course I carried
my gun with me. In my belt was my best hatchet.
In my pouch I had plenty of powder and shot.
In my pocket were two biscuits and a big bunch
of raisins. My dog followed behind me.
I went past my summer house, or bower, and
toward evening came to a fine open place close by
the sea.
It was a beautiful sight. The sky was clear, the
air was still. The smooth waters stretched away
and away toward the setting sun.
Far in the distance I could see land. I could
not tell whether it was an island or some part of
the mainland of America. It was at least fifty
miles away.
If it were the mainland, I felt quite sure that I
would at some time or other see a ship sailing
64
either to it or from it. If it were an island, there
might be savages on it whom it would not be safe
for me to meet. But it would do no good to
worry my mind about such matters.
I found this side of the island much more beau-
tiful than that where my castle was.
Here were large, open fields, green with grass
and sweet with flowers. Here, too, were fine
woods, with many strange trees and vines.
I saw many green parrots among the trees, and I
thought how I would catch one and teach it to talk.
After a great deal of trouble I knocked a young
one down with my stick. He was a good fighter,
and it was no easy' matter to get him. But at last
I picked him up and put him in my bag.
He was not much hurt, and I carried him home.
It was a long time before I could make him talk.
But at last he became a great pet and would call
me by my name. I shall have a funny story to tell
about him after a while.
Besides parrots there were many other birds in
the woods. Some of these were of kinds that I
had never seen before.
In the low grounds I saw some animals that
looked like rabbits. There were others that I took
CRUSOE —
to be foxes, but they were not such foxes as we
have in England.
I traveled very slowly around the island, for I
wished to see everything. Often I did not go more
than two miles in a day.
At night I sometimes slept in a tree, while my
dog watched below me. Sometimes I shut myself
up in a little pen made by driving tall stakes into
the ground. I felt quite safe, for nothing could
come near me without waking me.
Along the seashore there were thousands of
turtles and a great plenty of waterfowl.
I had no trouble to find all the food I needed.
Sometimes I had a roast pigeon for dinner, some-
times the juicy meat of a turtle, sometimes the leg
of a goat. No king could have fared better.
One day my dog caught a young kid. I ran and
got hold of it, and would not let him hurt it.
I had a great mind to take it home with me. So
I made a collar for it, and led it along by a string
which I had in my pocket.
It was quite wild and did not lead well. It gave
me so much trouble that I took it to my summer
house and left it there.
I then went home to my castle.
66
I HARVEST MY GRAIN

I CANNOT tell you
how glad I was to get
to my old house again
and lie down in my
good hammock bed.
I had been away for
nearly a month.
I was so tired from
my long journey that
I stayed in my castle nearly
a week.
While I was thus resting myself, I made a cage
for my parrot which I named Poll. He was very
gentle for a parrot, and soon became very fond of me.
Then I began to think of the kid that I had left
in my summer bower. So I went with my dog to
fetch it.
I found it where I had left it. It had eaten all the
grass inside of the fence and was now very hungry.
I gave it as much as it wished, and then I tied
the string to it to lead it away. But there was no
need of that, for it was quite tame.
67
It followed me everywhere. It was very gentle
and loving.
I had now a number of pets and was no longer
lonesome.
My life was much happier than it had been while
I was sailing the seas. I took delight in many
things that I had never cared for before.
My barley and rice had grown well and in an-
other month would be ready to be harvested.
But one day I saw that some animals had been
in the field. Goats and rabbits had trampled upon
the green stalks and had eaten the long blades of
barley.
If things kept on this way I should soon lose all
my grain.
There was nothing to be done but to build a
fence or hedge around the field. This was easy, for
the field was not large.
I drove tall stakes into the ground all around my
growing crops. These stakes were so close to-
gether that not even a rabbit could get between
them.
Then I tied my dog near the gate of the little
field, so that he would bark whenever any animal
came near.
My grain was now safe from the beasts. It grew
fast. The barley sent out large heads which soon
began to ripen.
But now the birds came down in great flocks to
rob me. They sat on the fence, they flew among
the stalks of grain, they carried away all the ripe
barley they could find.
This troubled me very much. The most of the
grain was still green. But I feared that as soon as
it ripened I should lose it all.
I loaded my gun and went out to the field.
There I saw the thieves, sitting on the fence and
watching me. I was so angry that I fired right
among them and killed three.
"Now I will show you how to steal my grain!''
I cried.
I put up a long pole in the center of the field,
and on top of it I hung the three dead birds.
"This will I do to all that venture to come into
my field," I said.
Strange to say, this ended all my troubles. Not
another bird came to that place so long as my
scarecrows hung there. In fact, the birds went
away from that part of the island, and I did not
soon see another.
69
I WORK UNDER MANY DIFFICULTIES
MY barley ripened and was ready
to be harvested. I had neither
scythe nor sickle to cut it down.
But' you will re-
member that I had
two old swords which
I had found in the
ship.
With one of these
swords I cut off the
heads of the barley,
and dropped them
into a big basket I
had made. I car-
ried these heads into my cave and thrashed out
the grain with my hands.
When all my harvesting was done, I measured
the grain. I had two bushels of rice and two
bushels and a half of barley.
This pleased me very much. I felt now that I
should soon be able to raise grain enough for
food.

70
Have you ever thought how many things are
necessary for the making of your bread?
You have nothing to do but eat the bread after
others have made it. But I had to sow, to reap,
to thrash, to grind, to sift, to mix, and to bake.
To do all these I needed many tools.
I had no plow to turn up the ground. I had
no spade nor shovel with which to dig it. But
with great labor I made me a wooden spade, which
was better than nothing.
After the ground was turned up, I sowed the
seed by scattering it with my hands. But it must
be covered so it would grow, and I had no harrow.
I cut down the branch of a tree, and dragged it
over the field. This, I think, was the way that
people in old times harrowed their ground.
The third thing to be done was to build a fence
around my field. After that came the reaping, the
curing, the carrying home, the thrashing, the parting
of the grain from the chaff, the grinding.
I needed a mill to do the grinding. I needed a
sieve to sift the flour. I needed yeast and salt to
mix with the dough. I needed an oven to bake it.
I had to do without the most of these things.
And this made my work very slow and hard.
I was very lucky in having saved so many tools
from the wreck, and for this I was indeed thankful.
What a hard case I would have been in if I had
saved nothing at all!
From time to time, as I felt the need of things,
I made a number of tools that served me very well.
They were not such tools as you would buy at the
store, but what did it matter?
I have already told you about the shovel which
I made from a piece of hard wood. Next to the
shovel I needed a pickax most of all.
Among the many things that I had saved from
the wreck, I found an old crowbar. This I heated
in the fire until it was almost white hot.
I then found that I could bend it quite easily.
Little by little I shaped it until I had made quite
a good pickax of it.
Of course it was heavy and not at all pretty.
But who would look for beauty in a pickax?
I at first felt the need of some light baskets in
which to carry my fruit and grain. So I began to
study how baskets are made.
It was not until I had searched almost every nook
on the island that I found some long slender twigs
that would bend to make wicker ware. Then I
72
spent many an hour learning how to weave these
twigs together and shape them into the form of
a basket.
In the end, however, I was able to make as good
baskets as were ever bought in the market.
I had quite a goodly number of edge tools.
Among these there were three large axes and a
great store of hatchets; for you will remember that
we carried hatchets to trade with the savages. I
had also many knives.
But all these became very dull with use. I had
saved a grindstone from the wreck, but I could not
turn it and grind my tools at the same time.
I studied hard to overcome this difficulty. At
last, I managed to fasten a string to the crank of
the grindstone in such a way that I could turn it with my foot.
My tools were soon sharp, and I kept them so.
73
I BECOME A POTTER

WHEN it came to making bread, I found that I
needed several vessels. In fact, I needed them in
many ways.
It would be hard to make wooden vessels. Of
course it was out of the question to make vessels of
iron or any other metal. But why might I not
make some earthen vessels?
If I could find some good clay, I felt quite sure
74
that I could make pots strong enough to be of
use.
After much trouble I found the clay. The next
thing was to shape it into pots or jars.
You would have laughed to see the first things I
tried to make. How ugly they were!
Some of them fell in pieces of their own weight.
Some of them fell in pieces when I tried to lift
them.
They were of all shapes and sizes.
After I had worked two months I had only two
large jars that were fit to look at. These I used for
holding my rice and barley meal.
I then tried some smaller things, and did quite
well.
I made some plates, a pitcher, and some little
jars that would hold about a pint.
All these I baked in the hot sun. They kept
their shape, and seemed quite hard. But of course
they would not hold water or bear the heat of the
fire.
One day when I was cooking my meat for dinner,
I made a very hot fire. When I was done with it,
I raked down the coals and poured water on it
to put it out.
75
It so happened that one of my little earthen-
ware jars had fallen into the fire and been broken.
I had not taken it out, but had left it in the hot
flames.
Now, as I was raking out the coals, I found some
pieces of it and was surprised at the sight of them.
For they were burned as hard as stones and as red
as tiles.
"If broken pieces will burn so," said I, "why
cannot a whole jar be made as hard and as red
as these?"
I had never seen potters at work. I did not
know how to build a kiln for firing the pots. I
had never heard how earthenware is glazed.
But I made up my mind to see what could be
done.
I put several pots and small jars in a pile, one
upon another. I laid dry wood all over and about
them, and then set it on fire.
As fast as the wood burned up, I heaped other
pieces upon the fire. The hot flames roared all
round the jars and pots. The red coals burned
beneath them.
I kept the fire going all day. I could see the
pots become red-hot through and through. The
76
sand on the side of a little jar began to melt and
run.
After that I let the fire go down, little by little.
I watched it all night, for I did not wish the pots
and jars to cool too quickly.
In the morning I found that I had three very
good earthen pots. They were not at all pretty,
but they were as hard as rocks and would hold
water.
I had two fine jars also, and one of them was
well glazed with the melted sand.
After this I made all the pots and jars and plates
and pans that I needed. They were of all shapes
and sizes.
You would have laughed to see them.
Of course I was awkward at this work. I was
like a child making mud pies.
But how glad I was when I found that I had
a vessel that would bear the fire! I could hardly
wait to put some water in it and boil me some
meat.
That night I had turtle soup and barley broth
for supper.
77

WHILE I was doing these things I was always
trying to think of some way to escape from the
island.
True, I was living there with much comfort.
I was happier than I had ever been while sailing
the seas.
But I longed to see other men. I longed for
home and friends.
You will remember that when I was over at the
78
farther side of the island I had seen land in the
distance. Fifty or sixty miles of water lay between
me and that land. Yet I was always wishing
that I could reach it.
It was a foolish wish. For there was no telling
what I might find on that distant shore.
Perhaps it was a far worse place than my little
island. Perhaps there were savage beasts there.
Perhaps wild men lived there who would kill me
"and eat me.
I thought of all these things; but I was will-
ing to risk every kind of danger rather than stay
where I was.
At last I made up my mind to build a boat. It
should be large enough to carry me and all that
belonged to me. It should be strong enough to
stand a long voyage over stormy seas.
I had seen the great canoes which Indians
sometimes make of the trunks of trees. I would
make one of the same kind.
In the woods I found a cedar tree which I
thought was just the right thing for my canoe.
It was a huge tree. Its trunk was more than
five feet through at the bottom.
I chopped and hewed many days before it fell
79
to the ground. It took two weeks to cut a log
of the right length from it.
Then I went to work on the log. I chopped
and hewed and shaped the outside into the form
of a canoe. With hatchet and chisel I hollowed
out the inside.
For full three months I worked on that cedar
log. I was both proud and glad when the canoe
was finished. I had never seen so big a boat
made from a single tree.
It was well shaped and handsome. More than
twenty men might find room to sit in it.
But now the hardest question of all must be
answered.
How was I to get my canoe into the water?
It lay not more than three hundred feet from
the little river where I had first landed with my
raft.
But how was I to move it three hundred feet
or even one foot? It was so heavy that I could
not even roll it over.
I thought of several plans. But when I came
to reckon the time and the labor, I found that
even by the easiest plan it would take twenty
years to get the canoe into the water.
80
What could I do but leave it in the woods
where it lay?
How foolish I had been! Why had I not
thought of the weight of the canoe before going
to the labor of making it?
The wise man will always look before he leaps.
I certainly had not acted wisely.
I went back to my castle, feeling sad and
thoughtful.
Why should I be discontented and unhappy?
I was the master of all that I saw, I might
call myself the king of the island.
I had all the comforts of life.
I had food in plenty.
I might raise shiploads of grain, but there was
no market for it.
I had thousands of trees for timber and fuel,
but no one wished to buy.
I counted the money which I had brought
from the ship. There were above a hundred
pieces of gold and silver; but of what use were
they?
I would have given all for a handful of peas or
beans to plant. I would have given all for a bottle
of ink.
CRUSOE — 6 8j

As the years went by,
the things which I had
brought from the ship
were used up or worn out.
My biscuits lasted more
than a year; for I ate
only one cake each day.
My ink soon gave out,
and then I had no more use for pens or paper.
At last my clothes were all worn out.
The weather was always warm on my island
and there was little need for clothes. But I could
not go without them.
It so happened that I had saved the skins of all
the animals I had killed.
I stretched every skin on a framework of sticks
and hung it up in the sun to dry.
In time I had a great many of these skins.
Some were coarse and stiff and fit for nothing.
Others were soft to the touch and very pretty to
look at.
One day I took one of the finest and made me
82
a cap of it. I left the hair on the outside, so as to
shoot off the rain.
It was not very pretty; but it was of great use,
and what more did I want?
I did so well with the cap that I thought I would
try something else. So, after a great deal of
trouble, I made me a whole suit.
I made me a waistcoat and a pair of knee
breeches. I wanted them to keep me cool rather
than warm. So I made them quite loose.
You would have laughed to see them. They
were funny things, I tell you. But when I went
out in the rain, they kept me dry.
This, I think, put me in mind of an umbrella.
I had seen umbrellas in Brazil, although they
were not yet common in England. They were
of much use in the summer when the sun shone
hot.
I thought that if they were good in Brazil, they
would be still better here, where the sun was much
hotter.
So I set about the making of one.
I took great pains with it, and it was a long time
before it pleased me at all.
I could make it spread, but it did not let down.
83
And what would be the use of an umbrella that
could not be folded?
I do not know how many weeks I spent at this
work. It was play work rather than anything else,
and I picked it up only at odd times.
At last I had an umbrella that opened and shut,
just as an umbrella should.
I covered it with skins, with the hair on the
outside. In the rain it was as good as a shed. In
the sun it made a pleasant shade.
I could now go out in all kinds of weather. I
need not care whether the rain fell or the sun shone.
For the next five years I lived very quietly. I
kept always busy and did not allow myself to feel
lonely.
I divided each day into parts according to my
several duties.
After reading in my Bible, it was my custom to
spend about three hours every morning in search
of food. Through the heat of the day, I busied
myself in the shade of my castle or bower.
In the evening, when the sun was low, I worked
in my fields. But sometimes I went to work very
early in the morning and left my hunting until the
afternoon.
84
I HAVE A PERILOUS ADVENTURE

I HAD never
given up the idea
of having a canoe.
My first trial, as
you have seen, was
a failure. I had
made too big a boat,
and I had made it too
far from the water. I could do better another time.
One day after I had harvested my grain, I set to
work.
There was no tree near the river that was fit for
a canoe. But I found a fine one nearly half a mile
away.
Before I began to chop the tree, I made all my
plans for taking the canoe to the water.
I worked now with a will, for I felt sure that I
would succeed.
In a few weeks the little vessel was finished. It
was a very pretty canoe, and large enough for only
two or three persons.
Small as it was, it was quite heavy. For you
85
must remember that it was a part of the tree, hol-
lowed out and shaped like a boat. It was as much
as I could do to lift one end of it.
How should I ever get it to the river?
I - have already told you that I had made my
plans for this.
Through the soft ground between the river and
the canoe I dug a big ditch. It was four feet deep
and six feet wide and nearly half a mile long.
I worked at this ditch for nearly two years.
When it was done and filled with water from the
river, I slid my canoe into it. It floated, as I knew
it would.
As I pushed it along to the end of the great
ditch and out into the river, it looked very small. I
could never hope to make a long voyage in it.
But I could sail round the island, and make little
journeys close to the shore.
Before starting out, I put up a mast in the prow
of the canoe and made a sail for it of a piece of1 the
ship's sail that I had kept with great care.
Then at each end of the little vessel I made
lockers or small boxes, in which I put a supply of
food and other things that I would need on my
voyage.
86
On the inside of the vessel I cut a little, long,
hollow place or shelf where I could lay my gun;
and above this I tacked a long flap of goatskin to
hang down over it and keep it dry.
In the stern I set up my umbrella, so that it
would keep the hot sun off of me while I was steer-
ing the canoe.
Then every day I made short trips down the
river to the sea and back again. Sometimes, when
the wind was fair, I sailed a little way out; but I
was afraid to go far.
At last I made up my mind for a voyage around
the island.
I filled my lockers with food. In one I put two
dozen barley cakes and a pot full of parched rice.
In the other I stored the hind quarters of a goat.
I also put in powder and shot enough to kill as
much game as I would need.
On a day in November I set sail on my voyage
It proved to be a harder voyage than I had bar-
gained for.
In the first place, there were so many rocks along
the shore that I sometimes had to sail for miles out
into the sea to get around them.
Then, when I was on the farther side of the
87
island, I struck a furious current of water that was
pouring round a point of land like the sluice of a
mill.
I could do nothing in such a current. My canoe
was whirled along like a leaf in a whirlwind. My
sail was of no use. The little vessel spun round and
round in the eddies and was carried far out to sea.
I gave myself up for lost. I was so far out that
I could hardly see the low shores of my island.
Suddenly I noticed that the canoe was only a little
way from the edge of the current. Just beyond it
the water was quite calm and smooth.
I took up my paddle again and paddled with all
my might. With great joy I soon found myself
floating in quiet water.
The wind was fair for the shore, and I set my
sail again. The canoe sped swiftly back toward
the island.
I saw then that I was sailing midway between
two strong currents. If I should be caught in
either, I would again be carried out to sea.
I needed all the skill I had to steer the canoe
aright. At last, when the sun was almost down, I
brought it into a quiet little cove where the shore
was green with grass.
88
I AM ALARMED BY A VOICE

As soon as I touched the land,
I fell upon my knees and gave
God thanks for bringing me safe
out of so great danger.
I made the canoe fast to a
rock by the shore, and lay
down on the grass.
I was so tired that I
soon fell asleep and did
not waken once until
the next morning.
I went up a little hill close by the shore, and
looked around to see what part of the island I
was in. t
To my right I saw some well-known trees which
I had visited when I was exploring the island. Then I knew that I was only a little way from
my summer house and that I could reach it easily
by walking.
I was sick of the sea, and I thought that nothing
would be so pleasant as a few days in my quiet
bower.
89
So, with my umbrella over my head, I started
across the country. It was. a hot day, and I walked
slowly.
I stopped often to rest, and did not reach my
summer house until it was growing dark.
I saw that everything was standing just as I had
left it; for I always kept it in good order.
As soon as I got over the fence, I sat down to
rest; and I was so tired that I fell asleep.
Then, all at once in the darkness, I heard a voice
calling me, " Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe!"
I was so full of sleep that I did not wake up
at once. But between sleeping and waking I
could hear somebody saying, "Robin Crusoe, Robin
Crusoe!"
I wondered who it could be, but I was still more
than half asleep.
Then the voice screamed in my ear, "ROBIN
CRUSOE!"
I sprang to my feet. I was frightened almost
out of my wits. Who in the world could be speak-
ing my name in that place?
No sooner were my eyes well open than I saw in
the dim light of the moon my Poll Parrot sitting
on a post quite close to my shoulder.
90
"Poor Robin Crusoe," he said. "Poor Robin
Crusoe."
He was looking down at me as though in pity.
He was but repeating the words I had taught
him. I knew that he was glad to see me, as I also
was glad to see him.
I let him sit on my thumb as he often did at
home. He rubbed his bill on my face and kept
saying: "Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you?
Where have you been?" and other words that he
knew.
I wondered how the bird had come to this place.
For I had left him at the castle. I asked him,
"Why are you here, Poll?"
But he answered me only by saying: "Poor
Robin Crusoe! Where have you been?"
I surely believe that the bird loved me.
In the morning I carried him with me back to
my castle.
As for the canoe, I would gladly have brought it
back to its place in the little river. But I was afraid
of being caught again in the furious currents; and
so I left it in the safe cove on the other side of the
island.
I AM HAPPY AS A KING

I HAD now had adventures enough for a time,
and I felt very happy to be at home with my goats
and other pets.
A few years before, I had started with keeping
three kids that I had caught. Now I had a
92
herd of three and forty goats, some of them young,
some old.
I kept them in five little fields that I had fenced,
at the foot of my castle hill. I never had any
lack of meat and I had plenty of milk, too.
Indeed, I had gone so far as to set up a little
dairy, and sometimes my goats gave me a gallon
or two of milk in a day.
Before coming to the island I had never milked a
cow, much less a goat, I had never seen butter
made, or even cheese. But I learned how to do
everything of the kind. And now I had more
butter and cheese than I could eat.
After dinner it was my custom to go out for a
stroll. How proud I was of my little kingdom!
If you had seen me then, you would not have
laughed. You would have been frightened. For
a stranger-looking fellow you never saw.
Be pleased to take a picture of me.
On my head was a big cap made of goatskin.
It was very tall and without shape. A flap hung
down from the back of it to keep the rain off my
neck.
I wore a short jacket of goatskin and a pair of
knee breeches of the same.
93
I had neither stockings nor shoes. But I wore
around my legs and feet some queer things that I
called buskins. They were made of goatskin, too,
and were of great use when walking among briers
or stones.
Around my waist I had a broad belt of rawhide.
I had no need of sword or dagger; and so I carried
in this belt a little saw and a hatchet.
Another belt, which hung over my shoulder, held
my powderhorn and shot pouch.
On my back was slung a basket. On my shoul-
der was my gun. Above my head I carried my
great clumsy, ugly umbrella.
My face was as dark as mahogany. It was
tanned by the sun and browned by the hot
winds.
My beard was at one time a yard long. But I
soon grew tired of it and cut it pretty short. Yet
even then it looked grizzly enough, I assure you.
It is not a very handsome picture, is it?
But do not blame me. I dressed as well as I
could. I kept myself clean. I tried to be worthy
of respect, even though no one saw me.
I looked over my little kingdom and was proud
and happy,
94
You would have laughed to see me and my
family when dinner time came.
First there was myself, Robinson Crusoe, king of
the island. I was the lord of everything I could
see.
Then, like a king, I dined alone, with my serv-
ants looking on.
No one was allowed to talk to me but Pol1
Parrot, who sat on the back of my chair and
waited for what I would give him.
My dog was now so old and feeble that he could
hardly stir. He sat always at my right hand and
wagged his tail if I did but snap my finger. My two cats waited, one on each side of the
table, to see what I would give them.
These two cats were not the same that I
had brought from the ship. Those were dead,
long ago, of old age. But they had left many
kittens.
Indeed, there had come to be so many cats that
I was forced to drive them away. All but these
two had gone into the woods and become very
wild.

I LEARN TO BAKE AND AM PROSPEROUS

I HAVE already told you about my
farming, and of the difficulties under
which I did my work. The thing
which I wished to do most of all was
to make good bread.
I tried many plans, but it was
several years before I could think of
myself as a really good baker.
My barley was very fine. The
IF- grains were large and smooth. When
boiled a long time with a bit of
goat's meat, they made good food.
But they did not take the place of bread. Before
bread could be made, the grains of barley must be
ground into meal.
I tried pounding them with a stone. But this
was slow work. The stone crumbled into sand.
My meal was worth nothing.
I looked all over the island for a harder stone.
All were alike.
So at last I cut a large block of very hard wood.
I rounded it on the outside with my hatchet.
96
Then, partly by chopping, partly by burning, I
made a hollow place in the end of it.
Out of a piece of ironwood I made a heavy
pestle or beater.
I had now a very good little mill. In a short
time I had crushed enough barley to make meal
for a large loaf.
It was easy to make the dough. I had only to
mix the meal with water and knead it with my
hands. I must not think of yeast to make the
dough light.
The baking part was the main thing, and the
hardest to learn.
At. first I put my biscuits of dough in the hot
ashes and left them there till they. were baked.
But I did not like these ash cakes very well.
Then I tried another plan.
I made two large earthen vessels. They were
broad and shallow. Each was about two feet
across and not more than nine inches deep.
These I burned in the fire till they were as hard
as rocks and as red as tiles.
I made also a hearth before my fireplace, and
paved it with some square tiles of my own making.
But perhaps I ought not to call them square.
CRUSOE —7 tyj
The hearth, when finished, was quite level and
smooth. It was as pretty as I could have wished.
Next I built a great fire of hard wood. When
the wood had burned down, I raked the hot coals
out upon my hearth. I left them there till the
hearth was hot through and through.
My loaves of dough were all ready. I swept the
hearth clean and then put the loaves down upon
the hottest part of it.
Over each loaf I put one of the large earthen
vessels I had made. Then I heaped hot coals
on the top of the vessel and all round the sides
of it.
In a short time I lifted the vessels and took out
my loaves. They were baked as well as the best
oven in the world could have baked them.
By trying and trying again, I at last learned to
bake almost everything I wanted. I baked cakes
and rice pudding fit for a king. But I did not
care for pies.
I now felt quite contented and prosperous. For
did I not have everything that I needed?
I had two homes on the island. I called them
my plantations.
The first of these was my strong castle under the
98
rock. I had enlarged it until my cave contained
many rooms, one opening into another.
The largest and driest of these was my store-
room. Here I kept the largest of my earthen pots.
Here also were fourteen or fifteen big baskets, all
filled with grain.
My sitting room was not large, but it was made
for comfort.
As for the wall in front of the castle, it was a
wonderful thing. The long stakes which I had
driven down had all taken root. They had grown
like trees, and were now so big and so thick
with branches that it was hard to see between
them.
No one passing by would ever think there was
a house behind this matted row of trees.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the land, were my two barley fields. These
I cultivated with care, and from them I reaped a
good harvest. As often as I felt the need of more
barley I made my fields larger.
Farther away was what I called my country seat.
There was my pleasant summer house or bower,
where I liked to go for rest.
In the middle of my bower I had my tent always
99
set. It was made of a piece of sail spread over
some poles.
Under the tent I had made a soft couch with the
skins of animals and a blanket thrown over them.
Here, when the weather was fair, I often slept at
night.
A little way from the bower was the field in
which I kept my cattle — that is to say, my goats.
I had taken great pains to fence and inclose this
field. I was so fearful, lest the goats should break
out, that I worked many a day planting a hedge all
around. The hedge grew to be very tall and was
as strong as a wall.
On the shore of the sea, some distance beyond
my summer house, was the little inlet where I had
laid up my canoe.
ICO
I SEE SOMETHING IN THE SAND
WHEN the weather was fine
I often went over to the other
„ side of the island to
look at my canoe.
Sometimes I spent
several days at my summer
house. Then, going over to
where the canoe was kept, I
took short sails along the
shore. These little voyages
gave me a great deal of pleasure.
One morning as I was going to the canoe a
strange thing happened.
I was walking slowly along and looking down,
and what do you think I saw?
I saw the print of a man's naked foot in the sand.
The sight made me cold all over.
I stood like one that had seen a ghost. I looked
around. I listened. I trembled.
I went to the top of a little hill to look farther.
Then I walked up the shore and down the shore.
I saw no other tracks.
101
I went back to make sure that I was not dream-
ing. Yes, there in the sand was the print of a
man's foot. It showed the toes, the heel, and the
sole of the foot. I was not dreaming.
My mind was filled with a thousand thoughts
and questions. Where was the man who made
that track? Who was he? How did he get
there?
I was so frightened that I did not go to the
canoe. I turned back and went to my castle as
fast as I could.
Whether I went over by the ladder or through
the hole in the rock, I do not know. But I shut
myself up as quickly as I could and began to get
ready to defend myself.
That night I could not sleep. I lay in my ham-
mock, and thought and thought.
The track must have been made by an Indian or
some other wild savage. This savage had come
perhaps from the land that I had seen far across
the sea.
Perhaps he had come to the island alone. Per-
haps he had come with many others of his kind.
But where was he now?
I was so much afraid that I did not stir out of
102
my castle for three days and nights. I was almost
starved, for I had only two or three barley cakes in
my kitchen.
Little by little I became brave enough to go out
again. I crept softly down to my fields to milk the
goats. Poor things! They were glad enough to
see me.
But every sound made me start and look around.
I fancied that I saw a savage behind every tree.
I lived for days like some hunted thing that trem-
bles at its own shadow.
And all because I had seen the print of a foot
in the sand!
Little by little I grew bolder, and I made up
my mind to strengthen my castle. If savage In-
dians should indeed come and find me, I would be
ready for them.
So I carried out earth and small stones, and
piled them up against the castle wall till it was
ten feet thick. I have already told you how strong
it was at first, and how I had made a dense hedge
of trees on the outside. It was now so strong
that nothing could break through it.
Through the wall at certain places I made five
holes large enough for a man's arm to reach in.
103
In each of these holes I planted a gun; for you
will remember that I brought several from the
ship.
Each one of these guns was fitted in a frame
that could be drawn back and forth. They worked
so well in their places that I could shoot off all
five of them in less than two minutes.
Many a weary month did I work before I had
my wall to my notion. But at last it was finished.
The hedge that was before it grew up so thick
and high that no man nor animal could see through
it. If you had seen it, you would not have dreamed
there was anything inside of it, much less a house.
For two years I lived in fear. All that I did
was to make my home stronger and safer.
Far in the woods I built a large pen of logs
and stakes. Around it I planted a hedge like that
in front of the castle. Then I put a dozen young
goats into it, to feed upon the grass and grow up.
If savages should come, and if they should kill
the other goats, they could not find these; for
they were too well hidden in the deep woods.
All these things I did because I had seen the
print of a man's foot in the sand.
104
I AM AGAIN ALARMED
FIVE or six years had
passed, and not another
footprint had I seen.
I had gotten over my
great fright, and yet I
was not so bold as I
had been. Any sud-
den sound would make
me start and look
around.
I thought that if
savage men had been
on the island once,
they were quite likely
to come again. So I
kept on the lookout for them all the time.
My flock of goats had now grown to be very
large, and I needed another field. I wished to
put some of them in a hidden spot where the sav-
ages, if they did come, would not find them.
I had already a small flock in one such spot, as
I have told you. But now I wished to have another.

105
In looking for the right kind of place, I went
all over the island. I even went far out on a
rocky point beyond the place where I kept my
canoe.
As I was standing on a rock and looking out
to sea, I thought I saw a boat in the distance. It
was only a little speck on the water, and it seemed
to rise and fall with the waves. It could not be
a rock.
I looked at it till my eyes could look no more.
I had saved a spyglass out of the ship; but, as luck
would have it, I had left it at home. How I wished
for it then!
Whether I really saw a boat or not, I do not
know. But as I walked back along the shore, I
made up my mind never to go out again without
my spyglass.
I walked slowly along, thinking of what I had
seen. All at once I came upon that which made
my heart stand still.
On the sandy, sloping beach of a pleasant little
harbor I saw not only one footprint, but hundreds
of them.
I stood still, afraid to move.
But the footprints were not all. The beach at
106
one place was covered with bones and bits of flesh,
as in a slaughter house. Some of the bones were
quite fresh; some had been charred with fire.
"Here the savages have been holding a feast," I
said to myself.
A little farther on I saw that a pit had been dug
in the sand, and here they had had their fire. The
ashes were still warm.
I wondered what kind of a feast these wild men
had been having. There were savages on the main-
land who were said to kill and eat the captives
whom they took in war. Cannibals, they were
called.
Could this have been a feast of cannibals? And
were these the bones and flesh of human beings?
I trembled as I thought of it.
I turned and ran from the place as fast as I
could.
I ran until I could go no farther. My breath
came fast. I sank down upon the ground.
When I had rested a little while, I looked around
and found that I was not very far from my cas-
tle. All around me was peaceful and still. I was
surely safe from harm.
With tears in my eyes I knelt down and gave
107
thanks to God. I thanked him that he had kept
me alive and safe through so many years. I
thanked him that I had been cast on the side
of the island which was never visited by savages.
I thanked him for all the comforts and blessings
that were mine.
Then I arose and went home to my castle.
As I sat before my door that evening, I thought
the whole matter over, and felt much easier in my
mind.
I had been on the island eighteen years before I saw the first footprint. I had been there twenty-
three years before I saw any other signs of savages.
It was likely that many more years would pass
before any harm should come to me.
With these thoughts I lay down in my hammock
and slept without fear.
But it was a long time before I went again to the
farther shore of the island. I did not even go to
look after my canoe.
The days went quietly by. I kept quite close to
my castle, and busied myself with my goats and my
grain.
I was always on my guard, and never stepped out
of doors without first looking around me.
108
I MAKE A SURPRISING DISCOVERY

ONCE every week I went
into the woods to see the
flock of goats that I had
hidden there.
I always carried
my gun, but since
my last great fright
I did not dare to
fire it off. I was afraid
even to drive a nail or
chop a stick of wood, lest some savages might be
near enough to hear the sound.
I was afraid to build a fire at my castle, lest the
smoke should be seen.
At last I carried some of my pots and kettles to
my hidden field in the woods. I could do my
cooking there much more safely than at my castle.
Hardly had I put things in order there when I
found something that made me very glad. What
do you suppose it was?
It was a cave — a real cave. The door into it
was through a little hollow place at the bottom of
109
a great rock. It was so well hidden that no one
could have found it even by looking for it.
Shall I tell you how I came upon it?
I was afraid to make a smoke near my house,
and yet I could not live without cooking meat. I
tried all kinds of dry wood, and yet there was
always some smoke. Then I thought I would try
charcoal. But I must first make the charcoal.
I found a place in the darkest part of the woods
where the smoke would hardly rise to the tops of
the trees. There I built my charcoal pit.
This was done in the following way: —
First, I cleared off a round space about ten feet
in diameter. Here I dug out the earth till I made
a pit about a foot deep. Then I cut a cord or
more of wood and piled it up in this space. I piled
it up until it was almost as high as my shoulders.
I covered it a foot deep with earth and turf, leaving
a small open place at the bottom.
When this was done, I set fire to the wood
through the hole in the bottom. It burned slowly.
The wood became charcoal.
One day, while cutting wood for my charcoal pit,
I happened to see a hollow place in the rock close
by a tree I was chopping.
no
It was half covered with brush. I pushed this
aside and looked in. I saw a little cave just large
enough for me to creep into on my hands and
knees.
But, a little farther in, it was larger. It was so
high that I could stand upright, and it was so wide
that two men could have walked in it side by side.
It was a very dark place, and I stood still a mo-
ment till my eyes should become a little used to it.
All at once I saw something in the darkness that
made me scramble out of that place much faster
than I had come into it.
What do you think it was? Two big shining
eyes that glowed like coals in the darkness;
Whether they were the eyes of a man or of some
fierce beast, I did not stop to see.
I stood a little while by the. mouth of the cave
and then I began to get over my fright.
What could there be in this cave that would do
me harm? No man could live there in the dark-
ness. As for any animal, I knew there was
nothing fiercer on the island than one of my cats.
So, with a blazing stick for a torch, I crept back
into the cave. But I had not gone three steps
before I was frightened almost as much as before.
in
I heard a loud sigh, like that of a man in trouble.
Then there were low moans, and sounds as of some
one trying to speak.
I stopped short. Cold chills ran down my back.
My hair seemed to stand on end. But I would not
allow myself to run out again.
I pushed my little torch forward into the dark-
ness, as far as I could. The blaze lit up the cave
And what do you suppose I saw then?
Why, nothing but a shaggy old goat that I had
missed from my flock for nearly a week past.
He was stretched on the floor of the cave, and
too weak to rise up. He was a very old fellow, and
perhaps had gone in there to die.
I gave him some food and water, and made him
as comfortable as I could. But he was too far gone
to live long.
I found that, although I could stand up in the
cave, it was very small. It was only a hole in the
rocks, and was neither round nor square.
But at the end of this little chamber there seemed
to be a passage that led farther in. This passage
was very narrow and dark, and as my torch had
burned out, I did not try to follow it.
I went back to my wood chopping.
112
I EXPLORE MY CAVE FARTHER
THE next day I brought
out with me six big can-
dles.
For you must know
that I was a candle maker
as well as a baker. In-
deed, I made very good
candles of goats' tallow,
using some bits of old
ropes for the wicks.
As I have just said,
I took six candles with
me, for I had made up
my mind to learn more about the cave I had
found.
I lit two of the candles, and went in. The poor
old goat was dead, and it was no easy work to dig a
hole right there and bury him.
After this unpleasant task was done, I went
into the back part of the cave. The flame of the
candles lighted up the darkness, and I could see
quite plainly.
CRUSOE — 8 113

The narrow passage of which I have told you
was no less than thirty feet long. In one place it
was so low that I had to creep through on all
fours.
But no sooner was I through this low place than
I found myself in a splendid chamber. It was
large enough to shelter a hundred men.
Indeed, it seemed like the great hall of some
old English castle. I had never seen anything so
grand.
The roof was at least twenty feet high. The
light from my two candles shone upon the walls
and made it look as though covered with thousands
of bright stars.
Whether these were diamonds, or gold, or some
other precious things, I did not know, and in fact
I never learned.
The floor was dry and level. It was covered
with white sand, which was very clean.
I was delighted. No better or safer storehouse
could I have wished.
When I had looked at the room on every side
and found that it was really the end of the cave, I
went out and hurried back to my castle.
I found that I still had about sixty pounds of
114
powder. This was the first thing that I carried to
my new cavern. I took thither also the lead that
I had for making bullets and small shot.
I felt now like one of the wonderful elves that
you read about. They live, as you know, in rocks
and in caves where none can get at them; and
they have hidden treasures of gold and precious
stones.
What if a hundred savages should hunt me?
They could not come near me here. I was safe
from all foes.
I fitted the cave up with whatever was needed to
make it comfortable.
If the worst came to the worst, I meant to live
there. And yet I did not wish to be obliged to
do this.
When everything was safe and snug, I laid some
green branches over the entrance and went back
to my castle.
I was very glad when I sat down in my old
kitchen again. For, after all, no other place was so
much like home.
I had now been twenty-three years on this island.
If it had not been for fear of savages, I would have
been the happiest man in the world.
"5
During all those years I had been very busy.
I did not work all the time, as you know, but I
amused myself in various ways.
I spent much time with Poll, the parrot. He
soon learned to talk so well that it was a pleasure
to hear him.
My dog had been my best friend and companion.
He lived for sixteen years, and then died of old
age.
As for my cats, the woods were full of them. All
ran wild except the two that I kept in my castle.
These were good mousers and fine pets.
I had also several tame fowls. These I had
caught near the seashore when they were young.
I cut their wing feathers short and taught them
to eat from my hand.
I never knew what kind of birds they were, but
they were large, almost as large as chickens. They
lived among the hedge trees in front of my castle.
They made their nests there and kept me well
supplied with eggs. I did not need to keep any
other poultry.
Thus I lived very pleasantly in my island home.
I would have been content to live there always if
I could have felt safe from savages.
I SEE SAVAGES

EARLY one morning in har-
vest time I went out to my
grain fields to cut
down some barley.
The days were so
very hot that it was
pleasanter to rise
before daylight and
do the heavier part of my work before the sun
was high.
On this morning of which I am telling you, I
started out while it was still quite dark. I had
been to the fields so often that I could have found
the way with my eyes shut.
As I went along, I was surprised to see a light
far over toward my side of the island. I stopped
and looked. It was plainly the light of a blazing
fire.
Who could have built a fire there?
Surely none but savages.
I was so much surprised that I stood still and
wondered.
117
What if those savages should find my grain
fields?
They would know at once that somebody had
planted them, and they would never rest till they
should find me.
I could now see the blaze quite plainly. As the
day dawned, I could also see the smoke rising above
the trees. The fire was not more than two miles
away.
I hurried back to my castle, as fast as I could
run. I made everything on the outside of it look
as wild as possible.
I climbed over the wall and pulled up the lad-
der after me.
I loaded all my cannon, as I called the guns
that I had placed in the wall. I put everything
in order for a siege.
Then I waited to see if any enemy would come
near.
Two hours, three hours passed, and there was
no sight nor sound that was at all uncommon.
I began to wonder if, .after all, the fire had been
kindled by some accident and not by strange men.
At last I could wait no longer. I set up my
ladder against the side of the rock and climbed
118
up to a flat place above my castle. I pulled the
ladder up after me and then mounted to another
landing. I pulled it up a second time, and it now
reached to the top of the great rock.
Here was the place I called my lookout.
Very carefully I climbed up. I laid myself down
upon the rock and through my spyglass looked
over toward the place where I had seen the fire.
I could still see the smoke. Yes, and I could
see some naked savages sitting around a small
fire.
I counted them, and made out that there were
no fewer than nine of the wretches.
They surely did not need a fire to warm them-
selves by, for the day was very hot. No doubt
they were cooking something. Perhaps they were
cannibals and were getting ready for one of their
horrible feasts.
On the beach not far from them I saw the
two canoes in which they had arrived.
The tide was now at its lowest. When it re-
turned and floated the canoes, they would probably
go away.
This thought made me feel much easier, for I
was sure they would not wander far inland.
119
I waited and watched till the tide was again
at the flood.
Then I saw them all get into the boats and
paddle away. They seemed to be going around
to the other side of the island.
I could now breathe freely again. As soon as
they were well gone, I armed myself and hurried
across the land to see if I could get another sight
of them.
I carried two guns on my shoulder, two pistols
in my belt, and a big sword at my side. You
would have been frightened, had you seen me.
It was a long, hard walk. But by and by I
came to the hill that overlooked the farther shore
of the island.
This I climbed. I scanned sea and land with
my spyglass.
Yes, there were the two canoes coming slowly
around the coast.
But what was my surprise to see three other
boats put off from a cove near by and hasten
around to meet them!
It seemed, then, that another party of savages
had been feasting at the very spot where I had
seen the first footprint in the sand.
120
I watched the canoes until all five were far out
to sea, on their way to the low-lying shore in the
distant west.
Then I went down to the place where the
savages had been feasting.
What a dreadful sight met my eyes! The sand
was covered with blood and bones. No. doubt
some poor captive had been killed there and
eaten.
I made up my mind that if any other savages
should ever come to my island for such a feast,
I would not let them enjoy it.
I gathered up the bones and buried them in the
sand. Then I went slowly and sadly back to my
castle.
After that I never felt quite safe at any time.
I dared not fire a gun; I dared not build a fire;
I dared not walk far from home.
While awake, I was always planning how to
escape the savages. While asleep, I was always
dreaming of dreadful things.
Yet days and months passed by, and still no
other savages came.
121
I DISCOVER A WRECK
ONE day in May a great storm burst
upon the island. All day and far into
the night the rain fell and
the wind blew, the light-
nings flashed, and the thun-
der rolled.
But I was used to such
storms, and I minded it
but little. I stayed at
home in my castle, and
felt very thankful that I
had a place so safe and
dry and comfortable.
I sat up quite late, reading my Bible by the light
of a little lamp I had made, and thinking of my
strange lot in life. Suddenly I heard a sound
which I felt sure was the noise of a gun fired at sea.
I started up quickly. I threw on my raincoat
and mounted to my lookout on the top of the great
rock.
The rain had stopped and the wind was going
down. It was now past midnight, and very dark.

122
A moment after I had reached my place there
was a flash of light that caused me to stop and
listen for another gun.
In'a few seconds I heard it. It seemed to come
from that part of the sea where I was once caught
by the strong current and driven far out in my boat.
I knew at once that the shots were fired from
some ship in distress. Perhaps she was being driven upon the shore by the wind and waves.
Could I do anything to help the poor men on
board?
With great labor and danger to myself I gathered
some sticks and brush into a pile on the rock and
set it on fire.
The wood was not dry, but when the fire was
once kindled it blazed up fiercely and cast a light
over all the rocks and trees about me.
I felt sure that if there were sailors on the ship,
they could not help but see it. And no doubt they
did see it, for I soon heard another gun.
All night long I kept the fire burning; but no
other sound besides the wind did I hear.
When it was broad day and the mists had cleared
away, I turned my spyglass toward that part of the
sea from which the sounds came.
123
Far away from the shore there was surely some-
thing; but whether it was a wreck or a ship under
sail, I could not tell. The distance was too
great.
I watched it from time to time all day. It did
not move.
"It must be a ship at anchor," I said to myself.
Early the next morning I took my gun and went
down toward that side of the island where the cur-
rent had once caught me. When I had come to
the shore there, I climbed upon some rocks and
looked out over the sea.
The air was very clear now, and I could plainly
see the ship.
She was not at anchor. She was fast on some
great rocks, of which there were many in that part
of the sea.
I saw that the masts of the vessel were broken,
and that her hull was lying more than halfway out
of the water.
I thought of the sailors who must have been on
board, and wondered if any had escaped. It seemed
impossible that any could have reached the shore
through the furious sea that was raging during the
storm.
124
"Oh, that one had been saved!" I cried as I
walked up and down the shore.
I wrung my hands, my lips were firmly set, my
eyes were full of tears.
"Oh, that one had been saved!" I cried again
and again.
It was thus that after so many lonely years with-
out seeing a friendly face I longed to have at least
one companion to talk with and to share my hopes
and fears.
The sea was now quite calm. Even among the
rocks the water was smooth.
Seeing everything thus favorable, I made up my
mind to get my canoe and go out to the wreck.
I hurried back to my castle to get things ready
for my voyage.
I packed a big basket with bread; I filled a jug
with fresh water; I put a compass in my pocket
that I might have it to steer by; I threw a bag full
of raisins upon my shoulder.
Loaded with all these necessary things, I went
round to the place where my canoe was hidden. I
found her half full of water, for she had been lying
there neglected for a long time.
With much labor I bailed the water out of her
125
and got her afloat. Then I loaded my cargo into
her, and hurried home for more.
My second load was a bag full of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another
jug of water, a cheese, a bottle of milk, and about
two dozen barley cakes.
All these I carried around to my canoe. If there
were men on board the wreck they might be in
need of food.
When I had arranged everything in good order,
I started out.
I kept the canoe quite close to the shore until I
had rounded the point past which the dangerous
current flowed. Being then in smooth water, I
struck boldly out toward the wreck.
Soon, however, upon looking a little ahead of me,
I saw the second current flowing in a great eddy
past a long line of half-hidden rocks.
As I looked on these rapid currents, my heart
began to fail me. I knew that if I should be driven
into one of them, it would carry me a great way
out to sea. It would carry me so far that I should
never be able to get back again. k
Yet I was determined to persevere in my venture.
126
i>

WITH very
great care I
steered my canoe
out to sea. I
kept just within
the edge of the
current on my
right hand. It
carried me along at a great rate, but I did not lose
control of the canoe.
In about two hours I came up to the wreck. It
was a sad sight to look at.
The ship lay partly on her side, and was jammed
fast between two great rocks.
She looked like a Spanish ship. She had been
badly broken by the waves, and everything on her
decks had been swept away.
As I came close to her, a dog looked over her
side and barked at me. When I called him he
jumped into the sea and swam out to the canoe.
I lifted him on board, and found that he was
almost dead with hunger and thirst.
127
I gave him a barley cake, and he devoured it like
a half-starved wolf. I then gave him a little water,
but not too much lest he should harm himself. He
drank, and then looked up as if asking for more.
After this I went on board. A sad sight met
my eyes. For in the cookroom I saw two sailors
who had been drowned, with their arms fast around
each other.
I suppose that when the ship struck the waves
dashed all over her and the men had no way of
escape. Those who were not swept overboard
were drowned between decks.
Besides the dog there was no other live thing on
board.
I found some chests that had belonged to the
sailors. With much labor I got two of them into
the canoe without stopping to look inside of them. .
Besides these chests, I took a fire shovel and
tongs, which I needed very much. I found, also,
two little brass kettles, a gridiron, and a large
copper pot.
The tide was now setting in toward the island
again. So, with the few goods I had found and the
poor dog, I started for home.
By keeping on the outside of the eddying current
128
I had no trouble in bringing the canoe safe to land.
The sun was almost down when I anchored her in
a little inlet just off the point of rocks.
I was so tired that I could do nothing more that
day. So, after eating my supper, of which I gave
the dog a good share, I lay down in the canoe and
went to sleep.
I slept very soundly, and did not wake until
morning.
In looking over my goods, I made up my mind
to store them in my new cave in the woods. For
that was much nearer than my home castle.
When I opened the chests I found several things
that I was very glad to get.
In one I found two jars of very good sweetmeats.
They were so well corked that the salt water had
not harmed them. There were two other jars of
the same kind; but they were open at the top, and
the water had spoiled the sweetmeats.
In the other chest there were some good shirts,
which I needed very much. There were also
about a dozen and a half of white linen handker-
chiefs. I was very glad to find these, for they
would be pleasant to wipe my face with on a hot
day.
CRUSOE — 9 I2Q
In a secret drawer of the first chest I found three
bags of Spanish money. I counted eleven hundred
pieces of silver.
At the bottom of one of the bags there were six
Spanish gold pieces, each worth about fifteen
dollars. These were wrapped up in a piece of
paper.
At the bottom of the other bag there were some
small bars of gold. I suppose there was at least a
pound of these yellow pieces.
After all, I got very little by this voyage. I had
no use for the money. It was worth no more to
me than the dust under my feet. I would have
given it all for a pair of good shoes or some stock-
ings for my feet.
After I had carried everything to my cave, I took
the canoe back to her old harbor on the farther side
of the island. Then I returned to my castle, where
I found everything in good order.
And now I began to live easily again. I was as
watchful as before, and never went from my castle
without looking carefully around.
I seldom went to the other side of the island.
When I visited my cave in the woods, or went to
see my goats, I took good care to be well armed.
130
I HAVE A QUEER DREAM

Two years passed without any alarms, and I was
beginning to think that nothing would ever again
happen to disturb the quiet of my life.
One night in the rainy season of March I could
not sleep. I lay for hours in my hammock and
was not able to close my eyes.
I was thinking, thinking, thinking.
I thought of all that had ever happened to me
both before and after my shipwreck.
I thought of my first happy years on the
island.
I thought of the fear and care that I had lived
in ever since I saw the first footprint in the
sand.
Then I thought of my great desire to see my
native land once more, and to have friends and
companions with whom I could talk.
These thoughts brought to mind the savages of
whom I had so great a. dread, and I began to ask
myself a thousand questions about them.
How far off was the coast from which they
came?
Why did they come to my island from so great
a distance?
What kind of boats did they have?
With such thoughts as these I lay awake until
far in the night. My pulse beat fast, my breath
came hard, my nerves were unstrung.
At last, worn out by my very restlessness, I fell
asleep.
The same thoughts must have followed me into
my dreams, but they took a different form.
I dreamed that I was sitting on the seashore with
my gun on my lap and my umbrella by my side.
132
I was thinking, thinking, thinking. I had never
been so sad and lonely.
I was thinking of the home I was never to see
again, and of the friends who perhaps had forgot-
ten me.
Suddenly, as I lifted my eyes, I thought I saw
two canoes coming toward the island. I ran and
hid myself in a grove by the shore.
There were eleven savages in the canoes, and
they had with them another savage whom they
were going to kill and eat.
But I thought in my sleep that this savage
suddenly sprang up and ran for his life.
I thought that he came running to the little
grove, to hide himself in it.
Seeing him alone, I arose and met him. I
smiled kindly, and tried to make him know that
I was his friend.
He threw himself on the ground at my feet.
He seemed to be asking my help.
I showed him my ladder and made him go up
over the wall.
Then I led him into my castle, and he became
my servant.
I thought in my sleep, that I cried aloud for
133
joy and said: "Now I shall escape from this
place. For this savage will be my pilot. He
will guide me to the mainland. He will tell me
where to go and what to do. He will help me
find my own people."
This thought filled my mind with great joy,
and while I was still rejoicing I awoke.
What a disappointment it was to find that it
was only a dream!
For several days I felt very sad. I was almost
ready to give up hope.
Then I remembered my dream; and I said to
myself: "If I could only get hold of a savage and
teach him to love me, things might turn out
just that way. He must be one of their pris-
oners and I must save him from being eaten;
for then it will be easy to win his friendship."
This thought so fixed itself in my mind that
I could not get rid of it. Waking or sleeping, I seemed to be always planning to get hold of
a savage.
At last I set myself about it in earnest. Al-
most every day I went out with my gun to see
if some of these wild men had not again landed
on my island.
134
I GET HOLD OF A SAVAGE

FOR a year and a half I kept close watch upon
the farther shore of the island as well as upon
that nearest to my castle. But not a single
savage came near.
One morning in June, however, I had a great
surprise.
I was just starting out from my castle when
I saw five canoes lying high and dry on the
beach not a mile away. There was not a man
near them. The people who had come in them
were perhaps asleep among the trees.
The. number of canoes was greater than I had
ever counted upon seeing. For there were always
four or six savages in each canoe, and there
must now be between twenty and thirty men
somewhere on the shore.
I did not know what to think of it. I did
not feel brave enough to attack so many.
So I stayed in my castle and made ready to
defend myself.
"There is little hope of getting a savage this
time," I thought to myself.
I waited a long while, but heard no unusual
sound. I grew tired of waiting, and made up
my mind to see what was going on.
So, with the help of my ladder, I climbed up to
my lookout on the top of the rock. I put my
spyglass to my eyes and looked down upon the
beach.
136
Surely enough! there they were. I saw no
fewer than thirty naked savages dancing around
a fire. I saw that they were broiling meat upon
the coals, but I could not tell what kind of meat
it was.
As I watched I saw some of the dancers run to
a boat and drag two miserable prisoners from it.
They must have been in the boat all the time, but
as they were lying down I did not see them.
All the dancers now crowded around the poor
prisoners. They knocked one of them down with a
club, and then fell upon him with their knives. I
supposed they were going to cut him up for their
horrid feast.
For a few moments they seemed to forget the
other prisoner, for they left him standing alone at
one side.
All at once he made a break for liberty. You
never saw a hound run so fast.
He ran along the sandy beach, right toward my
castle. I was dreadfully frightened. I thought
that now my dream was coming true, and that he
would surely hide in my grove.
But would the other part of the dream come
true? Would the other savages lose sight of him.
137
and running another way, not come near the castle?
I feared not.
However, I stayed in my lookout and watched
to see what would happen.
I saw, to my joy, that only three of the savages
followed him. He ran so fast that he gained
ground on them. If he could hold out for ten or
fifteen minutes, he would get away from them all.
Between the savages and my castle there was the
little river where I had first landed with my raft.
If the poor fellow could not swim across this
stream, he would surely be taken. I watched to
see what he would do.
To my surprise the river did not hinder him at
all. The tide was up, but he plunged in and with
twenty or thirty strokes was across. I had never
seen a finer swimmer.
When his pursuers reached the stream, he was
already far away. Two of them jumped in and
swam across. The other one stood still a minute
and then turned softly back. It was lucky for him
that he could not swim.
"Now," thought I to myself, " now is the time to
get me a savage!"
In another moment I was down in my castle. I
138
picked up my two guns. I was over the wall in
less time than it takes me to tell about it.
Never once did I think of fear.
I ran swiftly down the hill toward the sea. In
another minute I was between the poor captive and
his pursuers.
"Hello, there! Come back! I will help you,"
I cried.
Of course he did not understand a word. But
he heard me and looked back. I beckoned to him
with my hand, and this he understood better.
There was no time for waiting, however. The
two savages that followed were close upon me.
I rushed upon the foremost one and knocked him
down with my gun. I did not want to shoot, lest
the other savages would hear the noise and come to
his rescue.
The second pursuer came, running and panting,
only a little way behind. When he saw me, he
stopped as if he were frightened. I - ran toward
him, with my gun to my shoulder.
As I came nearer, I saw that he had a bow and
arrow and was taking aim at me. What could I
do but shoot? He fell to the ground and never
moved again.
139
I now looked around to see what had become of
the poor captive. I saw him standing still and gaz-
ing at me. The noise of my gun had frightened
him so that he did not know what to do.
I called to him: "Come here, my good fellow!
I will not hurt you."
But of course he did not understand. Then I
motioned to him with signs. He came a little way
and then stopped. He came a little farther and
stopped again. He was trembling like a leaf.
No doubt he was afraid that he would be killed
as his two pursuers had been.
I spoke kindly to him and made signs that I
would not hurt him. He came nearer and nearer,
trembling, and kneeling down at almost every step.
I smiled; I looked as pleasant as I could; I
made still other signs.
He came quite close to me. He laid his head
upon the ground. He took hold of my foot and
set it .on his neck. This was his way of saying
that he would be my slave forever.
I took hold of his hand and lifted him up. I
spoke kindly to him.
Thus I at last got hold of a savage, as I had
so long desired.
140
I AM PLEASED WITH MY MAN FRIDAY
THE savage spoke to
me. I could not under-
stand his words, but they
were very pleasant to
hear. For it had now
been more than twenty-
five years since I had
heard the sound of a
man's voice.
He pointed to the two
savages who had been
pursuing him. They were
lying on the ground
where they had fallen. Both were quite dead.
He could not understand how I had killed the
second savage when he was so far away from me.
He made signs that I should let him see whether his
enemy was really dead or only pretending to be so.
I told him, as well as I could, that he might
go to him. He ran to the fallen savage and looked
at him. He turned him first on one side and then
on the other. He seemed very much puzzled,

141
Then he picked up the savage's bow and arrows
and brought them to me.
I turned to go back to my castle and beckoned
him to follow me.
He stood quite still for a moment and then
pointed again to the bodies on the ground. By
signs he asked me if he might bury them, lest
the other savages should come up and find them
there. I answered by signs and gave him leave.
The work was quickly done. With a sharp
stick and his big hands he soon dug two big holes
in the sand. He laid the bodies in them and
covered them up. Then he smoothed the sand
and patted it down so that no one could see that
it had been touched.
Having thus put the two savages out of sight,
he turned to me again. I motioned him to follow
me. But on second thought I did not go back to
the castle. I led him far into the woods, to my new
cave of which I have told you.
Once inside of that cave, I felt safe.
I gave the poor fellow some bread and a bunch
of raisins to eat. I gave him also a drink of water
from a jug, and he was so thirsty from running
that he came near drinking it all,
142
Then I showed him a place where I had put some
rice straw with a blanket over it. It was quite a
good bed, and I myself had sometimes slept upon it.
He seemed to know that I meant for him to lie
down there and rest. Soon he was fast asleep.
He was a handsome fellow. He was tall but not
too large.
His hair was long and black. His forehead was
high and broad. His eyes were very bright.
His face was round and plump. His nose was
well shaped. His lips were thin. His teeth were
white as ivory.
His skin was not black like that of an African.
It was not yellow like that of some Indians. But it
was a kind of olive color, very pleasant to look at.
After he had been asleep about an hour he awoke
and came out of the cave where I was milking my
goats. He made signs to show that he was glad to
see me.
Then he laid his head flat down on the ground
and set my foot upon it, as he had done before.
This was his way of saying that he would do any-
thing I wished.
I understood him and told him by signs that I
was well pleased with him.
143
I spoke some simple words to him and tried to
teach him what they meant. He was quick to learn
and soon began to try to talk to me.
I named him FRIDAY, because it was on that day
ot the week that I had saved his life.
He soon learned to call me " Master," and to say
"yes " and " no " in the right way.
In the evening I gave him an earthen pot with
some milk in it, and showed him how to sop his
bread in the milk. I also gave him a barley cake,
which he ate as though it was very good.
All that night we stayed in the cave. But early
the next morning I led him back to my castle.
My first care was to learn .whether the savages
had left the island. I climbed to the top of the
rock and looked around with my spyglass.
I saw the place where the savages had been. I
saw where they had built their fire. But they were
not there. I could see no sign of them or of their
canoes. It was plain that they had left the place.
I gave my man Friday one of my guns to carry.
In his right hand he held my sword, and on his
back were his bow and arrows.
I carried two guns myself. And thus armed we
went boldly down to the beach.
144
The sand was red with blood, and bones and bits
of flesh were scattered all around. These I caused
Friday to gather up and bury.
We stayed on the beach for some time, but could
find nothing more.
Friday gave me to understand that there had
been three other prisoners in the boats with him.
I had no doubt that the savages had killed and
eaten them all.
The next day I made a tent for Friday to stay
in. It was just inside of my castle wall and in
front of the door into my own sleeping room.
As he had no clothes I set to work to make him
a suit. I gave him some linen trousers which had
belonged to one of our sailors, and which I had not
worn because they were too small.
Then I made him a little jacket of goatskin, and
from the skin of a rabbit I fashioned a very good
cap that fitted his head quite well.
You should have seen him when he was clothed.
He was very proud, but oh, so awkward!
He went around with a broad smile on his face.
He tried to do everything that was pleasing to me.
And indeed I was much delighted with him.
For no man ever had a more faithful servant.
CRUSOE—10 145
I TEACH FRIDAY MANY THINGS

WHEN my man
Friday had been
with me three
days I took him
:*" out hunting.
As we were going through
some woods I saw a wild
goat lying under a tree with two young kids
sitting by her. I caught hold of Friday.
"Stop," I said. "Stand still."
Then I took aim at one of the kids, shot and
killed it.
The noise of the gun so frightened the poor
savage that he did not know what to do. He
shook like a leaf. He thought that I was going
to kill him.
He did not see the kid I had shot. He threw
himself at my feet. Although I could not under-
stand a word he said, yet I knew that he was beg-
ging me to have pity on him.
And indeed I did pity him — he was so
frightened.
146
I took him by the hand and lifted him up. I
laughed at him and pointed to the kid that I had
killed. When he saw it and understood me, he
ran to fetch it.
Going on through the woods, I saw a big bird
sitting on a tree. I thought it was a hawk.
"See there, Friday!" I said, as I pointed to it.
Bang! went my gun. The bird fell to the
ground. It was not a hawk, but a parrot.
Friday was amazed. He looked at the gun and
trembled.
For a long time he would not touch a gun. He
would look at it and talk to it. He would say, in
his own language: "O wonderful thing! Do not
kill me! Do not kill me!"
We found nothing more in the woods that
day. Friday carried the kid home, and I took off
its skin and dressed it. Then I stewed some of
the best pieces and made some good broth.
At dinner I gave some of the broth to my man.
He liked it very well, but he could not bear salt
in it.
I tried to show him that food was best with a
little salt. But he did not think so, and he would
never eat meat that was salted.
147
We cleared it of water and then took a short
sail in it. Friday could paddle very well.
"Now, Friday," I said, "shall we paddle across
the sea to your own country?"
He looked very dull at my saying this, and I saw
that he thought the canoe was too small.
"Well," I said, "I have a bigger boat. I will
show it to you to-morrow."
The next morning, therefore, I took him to see
the first boat I had made and which I could not get
to the water.
He said it was big enough. But it had been
lying on the ground for twenty-three years and
was rotten.
"We will make a new boat, Friday," I said.
"We will make one as big as this. Then you
shall go to your old home in it."
He looked very sad.
"Why are you angry with Friday?" he asked.
"What has he done?"
I told him that I was not angry, and asked him
what he meant.
"Not angry! not angry !" he cried. "Then why
do you want to send Friday away to his old
home?"
150
"Why, Friday," I said, "didn't you say that you
wished you were there?"
"Yes, yes," said he. "Friday wishes both were
there, but not Friday without his master."
"But what would I do there?" I asked. "I
could do nothing."
"Oh, yes, master," he answered very quickly.
"You could do much. You could teach wild
mans to be tame, to know God, to live right. You
could do much."
"No, Friday," I said. "You shall go without me.
Leave me here to live by myself as I did before."
He looked very sad. Then all at once he ran
and picked up a hatchet. He brought it and gave
it to me.
"What shall I do with this?" I asked.
"You take it. Kill Friday," he said.
"Indeed," I said, "and why shall I do that?"
"Then why do you send Friday away?" he said.
"Better kill than send away."
The tears stood in his eyes as he spoke. I saw
that he loved me and would always stand by me.
So I told him that I would never, never send him
away, and that he should always stay with me.
You should have seen his eyes brighten.
I MAKE A NEW BOAT
i

I MADE up my
mind to begin the
new boat at once.
So, the next day,
I went with Friday
to find a good tree.
There were trees
enough on the island
to build a fleet. But
I must find one that
was close to the water, so that we could launch
the boat when it was made.
At last Friday found one. He knew, better than
I, what kind of wood was best for making a boat.
It was an odd-looking tree, and to this day I do
not know its name.
Friday chopped it down. He cut off a part of it
for the boat.
He wished to build a fire on the top of it and
thus burn out the hollow part of the boat.
But I showed him a better way, to chop it out
with hatchets and chisels.
152
In about a month it was finished. With our
axes we cut and hewed the outside till it was in
a very good shape.
Then we worked hard for two weeks to get the
boat into the water.
But when she was in, how well she floated! She
would have carried at least twenty men.
It was wonderful how well Friday could manage
her. It was wonderful how fast he could paddle.
"Now, Friday," I said, "do you think she will
carry us over the sea?"
"Yes, master," he said, "she will carry us even in
the worst wind."
My next care was to make a mast and a sail, and
to fit the boat with an anchor and a rudder.
It was easy enough to get the mast. I had Fri-
day cut down a tall young cedar that grew near the
place.
He shaped it and smoothed it, and made as
pretty a mast as you would wish to see.
As for the sail, that was another thing. I had
old sails, or pieces of old sails in plenty.
But they had been lying in this place and in that
for six and twenty years. It would be a wonder if
they were not all rotten.
After a long search I found two pieces which I
thought would do. I set to work, patching and
stitching.
It was slow work without needles, you may be
sure.
At last I had a three-cornered, ugly thing like a
shoulder-of-mutton sail to be put up with a boom
at its bottom part.
I had also a little short sprit to run up at the top
of the mast.
It took two months to make the sails and the
rigging as I wished.
Then I put in a rudder to steer the boat. I was
a poor carpenter, and I made a pretty rough job
of it.
Friday knew how to paddle a canoe as well as
any man.
But he knew nothing about a sail. He had
never seen a boat steered by a rudder.
We made several little voyages near the island,
and I taught him how to manage everything about
the boat.
Much as I wished to go back to my own people,
I could not make up my mind to try the long
voyage across to the mainland.
154
I had now been on the island twenty-seven years.
My man Friday had been with me about two years,
and these had been the happiest of my life. I had
everything to make me comfortable and happy.
Why should I wish to go away?
I had a great longing to see my native land
again, to talk with people of my own race, perhaps
to visit my kindred once more. This longing I
could not rid myself of, day or night.
But now new thoughts came into mind. I
felt that in some way I would soon escape from
the island. Indeed, I was quite sure that I would
not stay there another year.
I cannot tell you what made me feel that way.
But I seemed to know that some great change in
my life was near at hand.
Yet I went on with my farming as before. I
dug, I planted, I reaped, I gathered my grapes, I
did everything just as though I had no such
thoughts.
My man Friday was the truest of helpers. He
did all the heavy labor. He would not let me lift
my hand if he could help it.
The rainy season at last came upon us, and this
put an end to most of our outdoor work.
155
We took our new boat to a safe place some dis-
tance up the little river, above the point where I
had landed my rafts from the ship.
We hauled her up to the shore at high-water
mark, and there Friday dug a little dock for her.
This dock was just big enough to hold her, and
it was just deep enough to give her water to
float in.
When the tide was out we made a strong dam
across the end of it, to keep the water out. Thus
she lay high and dry on the bank of the river.
To keep the rain off we laid a great many
branches of trees upon her till she was covered
thickly with them. A thatched roof could not
have protected her better.
Little did I think that I should never see our
boat floating upon the water again. For all that
I know, she is still lying high and dry in her little
waterproof dock.
We were now kept indoors a great part of the
time, but we kept ourselves occupied pleasantly,
and the hours passed swiftly.
My first duty every morning was to read several
chapters from the Bible. Then I instructed Friday
in some of the truths of religion.
156
I was but an awkward teacher, but I did my best
and was honest.
I began by asking him about the Creator.
I asked him who made the sea, the hills, the
woods, the ground we walked on.
He told me it was one great being who lived
beyond all.
I confess I could not have given a better answer.
He said that this great being was older than the
sea or the land, the moon or the stars.
Then I said, " If this being has made all things,
why do not all things worship him?"
He looked very grave, and with eyes full of inno-
cence, answered, " All things say O to him."
Thus he taught me while I was trying to teach
him.
157

I PASS over some wonderful
things that happened during my
last year on the island.
For I must not make
this story too long.
I was fast asleep in
my castle one morn-
when Friday came
running in.
"O master, master!" he cried, "a boat, a boat!"
I jumped up and went out as quickly as I could.
I was in such haste that I forgot to carry my gun
with me.
I looked toward the sea. About three miles
from the shore I saw a strange boat coming to the
island. It carried a leg-of-mutton sail and was
coming swiftly with the wind. "Surely," I thought,
"this is not the kind of boat that savages sail in."
Then I saw that it was coming not from the
open sea on my side of the island, but from around
a point on the south shore.
I ran back to my castle and told Friday to stay
158
inside and keep quiet till we could learn whether
the people in the boat were friends or foes.
Then I climbed up to my lookout on the top of
the great rock.
I looked out toward the south shore, and there
I saw a ship lying at anchor. As nearly as I could
guess, it was about five miles from my castle and at
least three miles from the shore.
It looked just like an English ship, and the boat
was surely an English longboat.
I cannot tell you how glad I was at the thought
that some of my own countrymen were so near.
Yet I felt strange fears, and so made up my mind
to be very cautious.
In the first place, what business could an Eng-
lish ship have in these seas? The English had no
lands in this part of the world. They would not
come here to trade. There had been no storms
to drive the vessel to this place.
The more I thought of the matter, the more I
doubted. If these people were indeed English,
they must be here for no good purpose.
By this time the boat was quite near the shore.
I could see the men in it quite plainly. They
looked like Englishmen.
As they came in, the tide was at its highest,
and so they ran the boat far up on the beach
about half a mile from me.
I now counted eleven men, and all but three
were armed with swords. As soon as the boat
touched the land, the most of them jumped out.
Then I saw that the three unarmed men were
prisoners. Their hands were tied behind them
and they were closely guarded.
As they were led on shore, they seemed in great
distress as though begging for their lives.
When Friday saw all this, he cried out to me,
"O master! the white mans do just like savage
mans with their prisoners."
"Why, Friday," I said, "do you think they are
going to eat them?"
"Yes, yes," he answered, "they are going to eat
them."
The prisoners were led far up on the beach, and
I expected every moment to see them killed.
But soon their guards seemed to change their
minds. They talked together for a little while.
Then they untied the prisoners' hands and let them
go where they pleased.
The seamen scattered, some going this way,
160
some that, as though they wished to see the country.
But the men who had been prisoners sat down
on the ground and seemed very sad and full of
despair.
I thought then of the time when I had first
landed on that shore — how I had no hope, and
how I gave myself up for lost.
As I have said, the tide was at its highest when
the men came on shore. They rambled around
till it had flowed out and left their boat high and
dry on the sand.
They had left two men with the boat to guard
it. But the weather being very warm, these men
had fallen asleep.
When one of them awoke and found the water
far out from the boat, he began to hello for help.
All, the men came running and tried to drag the
boat out to the water.
'.«f - .
But it was so heavy they could- not, move it.
They tugged and pulled for, a'long time. Then I
heard one of them shout: "Let her alone, boys!
She'll float all right when the next tide comes
up." .
With that they gave it up and all strolled out
into the country again.
CRUSOE—II l6l
I MAKE A BOLD RESCUE

I KNEW that the tide would not be at its high-
est again before night. So I thought that I would
arm myself, and, as soon as it was dark, would
venture out and learn more about my strange
visitors if I could.
162
I looked at my guns and got everything ready,
and then sat down to wait.
The day, as I have said, was very hot. The
three men who had been prisoners still sat under
a tree by the shore. But all the rest were in the
woods. No doubt they would rest in some shady
place until the sun went down.
At about two o'clock I became so uneasy that I
could wait no longer.
"Friday," I said, "let us go out and see what
we can do."
You should have seen us as we marched out of
the castle.
I had two guns on my shoulders and Friday had
three. I had on my goatskin coat and my great
hat that I have told you about. At my side was a
naked sword, and in my belt were two huge pistols.
I must have looked very fierce.
We went quietly down the hill, keeping ourselves
hidden among the trees. At last, when we were
quite near the three men, I jumped suddenly out
before them and cried, "What are you, gentle-
men?"
Never were men more surprised.
They sprang to their feet, but they could not
163
speak a word. In fact, they were on the point of
running away from me when I cried: " Hold, gen-
tlemen! Do not be afraid. I am a friend. I
bring help."
"Then, indeed," said one of them, "you must
have been sent from heaven; for our case is hope-
less."
"All help is from heaven, sir," I said; and then I
briefly told them how I had seen them brought to
the shore.
"I am an Englishman," I said, "and I stand
ready to help you. I have one servant, and we are
well armed. Tell us what is your case, and how we
may serve you."
"Our case," said the foremost of the three men,
"is too long to tell you now; for our enemies are
very near. I was the captain of the ship that lies
at anchor offshore. Three days ago the sailors
all rose against me. They made me their prisoner.
They seized upon the ship, for - they wanted to
become pirates.
"They were about to kill me; but this morning
they decided to leave me on this island to die. The
men who are with me, they are doomed to the same
fate. One is my mate, the other a passenger.
164
"Being brought ashore here, we had no hope but
to perish. For it did not seem to us that any one
could live in such a desolate place."
"But where are those cruel enemies of yours?"
I asked. "Do you know where they are gone?"
"They are there, sir," he said, pointing to a grove
not far away. "They are sleeping in the shade. If
they should wake and see you with us, they would
kill us all."
"Have they any firearms?" I asked.
"Only two muskets," he answered, "and one of
these they have left in the boat."
"Then trust everything to me," I said. "If they
are asleep it will be easy to kill them all. But I
think it will be better to make them our prisoners."
The captain then told me that there were two
very wicked fellows among them who were the
ringleaders.
"It is they who have made all this trouble," he
said. "If they and two others could be overcome,
the rest would come back and do their duty.
Indeed, I am sure that many of them have gone
into this business against their will."
165
I HAVE AN ANXIOUS DAY
WHILE we were talking
we had slowly withdrawn
among the trees
where we were
sheltered from
sight.
The captain
promised me that
if we should suc-
ceed in getting
control of the
ship, he would do
anything that I wished.
He would carry me to
England or to any other part of the
world. He would live and die with me.
"Well, then," said I, "if you will all obey my
commands, we will see what can be done."
I gave each one of them a musket, with powder
and shot. I told them to kill as few of the ruffians
as they could, and to make prisoners of them all if
possible.

166
Just then we heard some of them awake. In a
moment three men came out of the grove and
started down to the shore.
"Are these the ringleaders?" I asked.
"No," answered the captain.
"Well, then, let them go," I said; "but if the rest
escape, it will be your fault."
With a musket in his hand and a pistol in his
belt, the captain started forward. I was close at his
side, while Friday and the other two men went a
little ahead of us.
The mate in his eagerness chanced to step on
some dry sticks which broke with a sharp noise
beneath his feet. One of the seamen, hearing this,
looked out and saw us.
He gave the alarm. The sleeping wretches
awoke and sprang to their feet. But it was too
late. Our guns were already upon them.
I need not tell you of the fight. It was sharp
and short.
At its close the two ruffians who had caused all
this trouble were lying dead upon the ground. The
three other men, who were but slightly hurt, were
our prisoners. As for my little army of five, not
one was so much as scratched.
167
While the captain and I were binding the
prisoners, Friday and the mate ran to the boat and
brought away the oars and the sails.
Soon the three men who had gone down the
shore came hurrying back to see what was the
matter.
When they saw how matters stood, they at once
gave themselves up and were bound with the rest.
So our victory was complete.
We now retired to the castle.
The prisoners were led into the back part of the
cave that I had first dug, and were left there with
Friday as their guard.
With the captain, the mate, and the passenger, I
went into my best room, where we all refreshed
ourselves with such food as I had at hand.
We had now time to talk over the past and make
plans for the future.
I told the captain my whole history just as I have
told it to you. He, in his turn, related to me the
story of his voyage from England to the West
Indies, and how his crew, wishing to become
pirates, had seized upon the ship and made him
their prisoner.
"There are still twenty-six men on board," he
168
said. "They are no doubt wondering what has
become of their fellows. After a while some of
them will be likely to come on shore to find out
what is the matter."
"Let them come," I said. "We will be ready for them."
We therefore went down to the shore where the
boat was still lying.
We found in it some rum, a few biscuits, a horn
of powder, and five or six pounds of sugar. This
last was very welcome to me, for I had not tasted
sugar for several years.
All these things we carried on shore. Then we
knocked a big hole in the bottom of the boat.
To tell the truth, I had but little hope that we
would ever recover the ship. But I thought that
after she had sailed away we might repair the boat.
Then we could no doubt make our way to the
Spanish settlements on the mainland.
About an hour before sunset, we heard a gun
fired from the ship.
"It is as I told you," said the captain.
We saw a signal waving from the mast. Then
several other shots were fired.
At last, when there was no answer either to the
169
signals or to the guns, there was a great stir on
board, and the other boat was launched.
I watched them with my spyglass.
As the boat neared the shore, we saw that there
were ten men in her and that they were all armed
with muskets.
The sun shone in their faces and we had a good
sight of them as they. came.
The captain knew them all. He said that there
were three very honest fellows among them who
had gone into this business against their will.
All the rest, however, were bad men who were
ready to do any wicked deed.
We now set free two of our prisoners, for they
seemed to be trustworthy men and glad that
matters had turned in the captain's favor.
"Can we trust them, Captain?" I asked.
"I will stand good for them," said the captain.
I gave them each a gun. We had now seven
armed men to meet the ten who were coming to the
shore.
But we kept ourselves hidden and waited to see
what they would do.
As soon as they reached the shore they ran to
see the other boat. What was their surprise to
170
find her stripped of everything and a hole in her
bottom.
They shouted, but no one answered.
They fired off their muskets, making the woods
ring with their echoes. But still there was no
answer.
Then they launched their boat again, and all
started to the ship.
But on the way they changed their minds. It
would never do, they thought, to leave their friends
on the island without so much as hunting for them.
They therefore rowed back to the shore. Three
men were left with the boat as guards, and the rest
started out into the country to seek their lost
companions.
We should have been glad if they had come our
way, so that we might have fired on them; but this
they failed to do.
Night was fast coming on, and they did not dare
to go far from the shore.
By and by they came back to the boat again.
We feared that they had given up the search and
would now return to the ship.
The sun was setting, and darkness would soon
cover both land and sea.
171
I AM CALLED GOVERNOR

BY my orders,
Friday and the
captain's mate hur-
ried through the
woods to the little
river where I had
landed so long ago
with my rafts.
When they had
reached the place, they shouted as
loudly ' as they
could.
The men who
were just getting
into the boat heard them. They answered, and
ran along the shore toward the little river.
The three who had been left in the boat also
rowed around toward the same place. Near the
mouth of the river, however, they came to land
again, and one of them ran along the bank of the
stream to meet his fellows.
\
172
At this moment I rushed forward with the
captain, and seized the boat before the two fellows
who were in it could save themselves.
It was now almost dark, and we had nothing to
do but wait till the seamen came back to the shore
to look for their boat.
Soon Friday and the captain's mate rejoined
us, and I stood at the head of my little army,
listening to the seamen as they made their way
through the bushes.
We could hear them calling to one another.
We could hear them telling how lame and tired
they were. We could hear them saying that
they were in an enchanted island where there
were witches and other kinds of uncanny things.
All this pleased us very much.
By and by they came to the shore, quite close
to where we were standing.
One of the men whom they had left in the boat
was standing with us. He was one of the honest
men whom the captain had pointed out, and he
had joined us very gladly.
By my orders he now cried out, "Tom Smith!
Tom Smith!" For that was the name of the
leader of the company.
173
Tom Smith answered at once, "Is that you,
Robinson?" for he knew the voice.
"Yes," the other answered, "and for God's sake,
Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or
you will all be dead men the next minute."
"To whom must we yield?" cried Tom Smith.
"Where are they?"
"Here they are," was the answer. "Here's
our captain at the head of a whole army of fight-
ing men. The boatswain is dead, and Bill Fry
is dead, and all the rest of us are prisoners. If
you don't yield, you are lost."
"If they'll give us quarters, we'll yield," said
Smith.
Then the captain himself spoke up. "You, Smith," he said, "you know my voice. If you lay
down your arms at once, you shall have your lives
— all but Will Atkins."
Upon this, Will Atkins cried out: "For God's
sake, Captain, give me quarter! What have I
done? I have been no worse than the rest."
Now this was not true. For it was Will Atkins
who had first laid hold of the captain, and it was
he who had tied the captain's hands.
"Nay, Will Atkins," said the captain. "You
174
know what you have done, and I can promise you
nothing. You must lay down your arms and trust
to the governor's mercy."
By "the governor" he meant me, Robinson
Crusoe — for they called me governor.
The upshot of the whole matter was that they
all laid down their arms and begged for their
lives.
Then I sent three of my men to bind them
with strong cords, which they did, much to my
joy. After that I sent my great army of fifty men —
which, after all, were only five besides the three
who already had them in charge — to lead them
to prison.
I told the captain that it would be better to put
some of our prisoners in one place and some in
another, as then they would be less likely to
try to escape.
He and Friday therefore took Atkins with two
others who were the worst to my cave in the
woods. It was a dismal place, but very safe.
There the rough fellows were left with their hands
and feet tied fast, and the door blocked up with
a huge stone.
Late as it was, I sent the rest of them to my
bower. As they also were bound, and as the place
was fenced in and was very strong, they were
quite safe there.
They were all much frightened. For they be-
lieved that the island was inhabited by English-
men, and that the governor had really a large army.
They felt that the better they behaved the safer
they would be.
The captain went out to talk with them.
"My men," he said, " you all know what a great
crime you have committed. You are now in the
power of the governor of this island. He will
send you to England. There you will be tried,
and you will be hanged in chains."
At these words they turned pale and groaned.
For they were but young men and had been led
into this by the four or five ruffians who were the
ringleaders.
"Now, my men," the captain went on, "you know
that I have always been kind to you."
"Certainly you have," said Tom Smith.
"Aye, aye!" cried all the rest.
"Well, then," said the captain, "it grieves my
heart to see you in this hard case. The ship, as
176
you know, still lies at anchor off the shore. It is
still held by some of the ruffians who brought this
trouble upon us. If I should persuade the governor
to set you free, what say you? Would you help me
retake the ship?"
"Aye, aye!" they all cried. "We would stand
by you to the end, for we should then owe our
lives to you."
"Well, then," said the captain, "I will see what
I can do. I will go and talk with the governor."
The matter was soon arranged.
The captain was to choose five of those he
thought would be most faithful. These were to
help him retake the ship. But the rest were to stay
in prison as hostages.
If the five behaved themselves well, then all were
to be set free. If they did not behave, then all were
to be put to death.
These were the governor's orders.
It was then agreed that the captain, with all the
men he could trust, should go out to the ship. I
and my man Friday were to stay on shore to watch
the prisoners.
The hole in the bottom of the long boat was soon
mended. Four men, with the passenger as their
CRUSOE—12 177
leader, went out in this. The captain, with five
men, went out in the other boat.
It was after midnight when they reached the
ship.
The men on board were taken by surprise, for
they thought that these were their friends who were
but just then returning to the ship.
They even threw a rope to them and helped
them on board, never suspecting that anything was
wrong.
The whole business was managed well. The
second mate and the carpenter, who were among
the leaders in the plot, were soon overpowered.
The rebel captain, the worst of the crew, was
asleep in his berth. He sprang up and showed
fight. He shot three times at the captain's party,
wounding the mate but touching no one else.
The mate, wounded as he was, raised his musket
and fired. The rebel captain fell to the deck with
a bullet through his head.
The rest, seeing that they were without leaders,
fell upon their knees and begged for their lives.
Thus the captain became again the master of his
own ship.
178
I HAVE A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES

THE next morning I slept
quite late in my hammock,
for the night had been full
of toil and I had had
but little rest.
All at once I was
awakened by the sound
of a gun.
Then I heard some one calling me, " Governor!
Governor!" It was the captain's voice.
I hurried out.
He grasped my hand and pointed to the sea.
There, a little way from our beach, was the
ship.
The weather being fair, the men had brought
her around and anchored her near the mouth of the
river.
"My dear friend," cried the captain, "there is
your ship! She is all yours, for we owe our lives
to you. We also are yours. Everything on board
of her is yours."
I was ready to sink down with surprise.
179
For here was a large ship, at last, ready to carry
me wherever I wished to go.
At first I could not answer him.
We stood for some minutes with our arms
around each other, and neither of us could speak.
At last I broke out, crying like a child. Then
we rejoiced together.
When he had talked awhile, the captain told me
that he had brought me a present.
"Bring up the box for the governor!" he cried to
his men.
They came up the hill, carrying a wooden chest.
When it was put down in my castle the captain
bade me open it and help myself to all that was in
it.
I did so.
I found first two pounds of good tobacco, then
twelve pieces of beef, six pieces of pork, a bag of
peas, a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of
lemons, and two bottles of lime juice.
But under these was the greatest surprise.
There I found six new shirts, six neckties, two
pairs of gloves, a pair of shoes, a pair of stock-
ings, a hat, and a very good suit of clothes,
I could now dress like a man again.
180
I went about it at once. It had been so long
since I had worn such clothes that I was very
awkward at putting them on.
But at last I came out fully dressed. Friday did
not know me. I hardly knew myself.
The next day all was in readiness to sail away.
The second mate, the carpenter, and other
ruffians who had been foremost in. the rebellion
were to be left on the island. In fact, I had put
the matter to them in such a way that they re-
quested this as a favor.
"It will be better to stay here than be taken to
England to be hanged," I said to them.
I left with them a keg of powder, three muskets,
and three swords.
I told them also about my goats, and how I
managed them — how I milked them and made
butter and cheese.
I showed them my fields of barley and rice.
I showed them, also, my castle, my cave in the
woods, and my bower.
"All these are yours," I said.
"They are much more than we deserve," said the
second mate; and I agreed with him.
181
I BRING MY TALE TO A CLOSE
AND so, on
the igth of
December,
1687, we set
sail for Eng-
land. I had
been on the
island twenty-
eight years,
two months,
and nineteen
days.
I took on
board with me
the money
that had been
by me so long and had been so useless.
I took also my big goatskin cap and my um-
brella. Neither did I forget my good Poll Parrot.
As for my man Friday, nothing in the world
could have parted him from me. He would have
gone to the ends of the earth with me.

182
The voyage was a long and hard one. But on
the eleventh day of June we at last reached Lon-
don. Once more I was in England, the land of
my birth.
I was as perfect a stranger as if I had never been
there.
I went down to York. My father and mother
had been dead a long time. The friends of my
boyhood had forgotten me.
I was alone in the world. Where should I go
and what should I do?
By chance I learned that my plantation in
Brazil was doing well. The man whom I had
left in charge of it had made much money from
the tobacco he had raised.
He was an honest man, and when he heard that
I was still alive he wrote me a long, kind letter.
In this he gave me a full account of the business.
He also sent me a large amount of money, which
I was very glad to get.
I was now a rich man. I might have settled
down to a life of ease and idleness; but such was
not my wish.
Soon I was wandering from one place to another,
seeing more of the world. I had many surprising
183
adventures, I assure you; but I need not tell you
about them. You would think any account of
them very dry reading compared with the story I
have already related.
And so, looking back with regretful memories
to the years which I spent on my dear desert island,
I bid you a kind good-by.

184
The story of Robinson Crusoe is ended. There is nothing fur-
ther in this book for the children to read. That which follows is
for grown-up people.
I85
TO DANIEL DEFOE, ESQ.
HONORED SIR:
If he who adds to the enjoyment of others is deserving
of happiness and high rewards, surely you have won no
mean place among those who are blessed. For who has
done more for the harmless entertainment of mankind
than you with your immortal " Robinson Crusoe "? It is
now nearly two hundred years since your fertile fancy
invented that story of marvelous though not impossible
adventures. You wrote it not for boys, but for men of
mature minds. You would doubtless have scorned the
thought of composing a book for children. And yet how
many millions of boys have remembered and blessed you
for having written that one tale!
Your book has had a great history. I imagine that you
wrote it hurriedly, at spare moments, while more important
duties were pressing upon you; for it bears all the marks
of hasty, not to say careless, composition. It is said that
you had some trouble in finding a publisher for it, and I
do not wonder. A manuscript so faulty in punctuation, in
grammar, in all the externals that go to make up a work of
art, would have to go begging a long time nowadays. But
it was the internal quality of your work that counted.
When it was published, people liked it. They talked
about your "Robinson Crusoe," they read it and reread it,
the boys took to it, and every year it grew in popularity.
187
Your plain, easy, everyday English made it a favorite
among the common people who had no use for the higher
forms of literary art. Then you had such a knack of
making everything appear so real! Your readers never
thought of poor Robinson as a creature merely of your
imagination; they thought of him as a living personage,
they felt acquainted with him as with no other hero of
fiction. Your book, therefore, lived. It was reprinted
and reprinted again. Thousands of editions were sold.
It was translated into every language in which books are.
printed. In our time no library is complete without it,
and no boy is considered a healthy boy who has not tried
to read it.
I say tried to read it; for who, in this busy age, has
succeeded in reading the half of those six hundred pages
or more that compose your original work? Who, indeed,
among your millions of admirers, has perused even a small
portion of the story without skipping numerous paragraphs,
perhaps whole pages? You had the knack of spinning
things out to their greatest length. You liked to dwell
upon incidents that were trivial and unimportant. You
felt impelled to preach an occasional sermon by giving up
whole pages to your hero's tedious reflections upon moral
and religious subjects. In your day, when books were
few and time was long, all this was very proper; it was no
doubt just what your readers expected and relished. But
you lived in the eighteenth century, and things have
changed since then. Now there are thousands of books
to be read, to say nothing of the newspapers; and there is
so much to be done that we must make use of the moments
in many various ways. We must read as we run. We
prefer to waste our time upon the frivolous rather than
188
upon the tedious. We must be interested. The medita-
tions of an imaginary hero seem to us neither instructive
nor entertaining. The upshot of the whole matter is that
people do not read "Robinson. Crusoe" now as they did
a few years ago. He who is not a judicious skipper will
most likely be bored by your long-windcdness and drop
the book before he has finished the half of it.
Again, who cares a fig for what Robinson did before he
was shipwrecked, or for what he .did after his return to
England? The life on the desert island, that is the pith
and the kernel of the whole story. If you had been writ-
ing for twentieth-century readers, you would have said very
little about those other matters; you would have gone
down to the kernel promptly, and when you had finished
with it you would have stopped.
Now in our schools we are doing that which would have
astonished the schoolmasters of your day. We are teach-
ing our children to read by putting into their hands books
which they cannot help but want to read. Our babes are
getting at the very cream of the world's literature. They
are draining it off so fast that the more cautious among us
begin to wonder if there will be only the skimmed milk for
them when they have grown to man's estate. You would
be astonished to hear our eight-year-olds discuss old ./Esop,
old Homer, and many a modern poet and prose writer of
whom you know nothing.
They discuss you, also, and they try to read your " Rob-
inson Crusoe." But it is hard reading, and there is so
much skipping to be done that when they have finished a
portion of it they have not so fine an opinion of the story
as you might suppose. It is plain, as I have already
hinted, that you did not write for readers of so tender years.
189
Now I have read in the preface to an early edition of
your book all that you say about the abridging of your
work. You declare that such an act is "as scandalous as
it is knavish and ridiculous." This, however, was addressed
to your eighteenth-century readers and not to us of this
much later day. < If you were living now, you would cer-
tainly think more kindly of it; for which is better, to be
abridged or to be skipped? So sure am I of your approval
that I have not only abridged your story, but I have writ-
ten it anew for children. Should it be said that I have
taken too great liberties with an immortal classic, my plea
shall be that I have merely acted the part of a translator.
The story remains yours. The ideas are yours; the main
points of the narrative are exactly as you put them; the
honor of the invention is wholly yours.
While preserving your simplicity of style, I have used
only such words and expressions as are easiest understood
by children in their second or third year at school. Some-
times they are yours, but oftener they are my own. I have
softened the harsher parts of your story, so as not to blunt
the gentler instincts of our young readers by dwelling too
long among scenes of blood and deeds of villainy. I have
passed over those tiresome reflections and moralizings
which you so confidently tell us are "the greatest Beau-
tys" of your work; for, like certain other beauties of your
time, their day is past and they have no longer any charm
or influence. In short, I have given your story a twentieth-
century form for a twentieth-century purpose. I have
written it anew in order that children may get to the ker-
nel of it at once without the bother of tearing away the
husks. Is it too much to hope that they will thus be led,
not only to an easier understanding of " Robinson Crusoe,"
190
but also to a deeper appreciation of its worthy and world-
famous author, Daniel Defoe?
With these explanations, I trust that you will accept my
apologies and will regard my well-meant efforts as neither
"scandalous," "knavish," nor "ridiculous." For, what-
ever may be the fate of my work, the fame of yours has
long been assured, and it is plainly impossible for me to
diminish in the slightest degree the honor that is justly
your due as the creator of " Robinson Crusoe."
