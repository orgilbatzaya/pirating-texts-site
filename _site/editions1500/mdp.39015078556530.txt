The Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe
CHAPTER I
HOW ROBINSON FIRST WENT TO SEA; AND HOW HE WAS
SHIPWRECKED
T ONG, long ago, before even your grandfather's
The Adventures of Robinson
a boy whose name was Robinson Crusoe. Though he
had never seen the sea till he was quite a big boy, he
had always wanted to be a sailor, and to go away in
a ship to visit strange, foreign, far-off lands; and he
thought that if he could only do that, he would be quite
happy.
But his father wanted him to be a lawyer, and he
often talked to Robinson, and told him of the terrible
things that might happen to him if he went away, and
how the people who stopped at home were always the
happiest. He told him, too, how Robinson's brother
had gone away, and had been killed in the wars.
So Robinson promised at last that he would give up
wanting to be a sailor. But in a few days the longing
came back as bad as ever, and he asked his mother to
try to coax his father to let him go just one voyage.
But his mother was very angry, and his father said,
"If he goes abroad he will be the most miserable wretch
that ever was born. I can give no consent to it."
Robinson stopped at home for another year, till he
was nineteen years old, all the time thinking and think-
ing of the sea. But one day when he had gone on a
visit to Hull, a big town by the sea, to say good-by
to one of his friends who was going to London, he
could not resist the chance. Without even sending a
message to his father and mother, he went on board his
friend's ship, and sailed away.
But in a few days, when the ship had sailed as far
as Yarmouth Roads on her way to London, they had
to anchor, and wait for a fair wind. In those days
there were no steamers and vessels had only their sails
to help them along; so if it was calm, or the wind blew
the wrong way, they had just to wait where they were
till a fair wind blew.
Whilst they lay at Yarmouth the weather became
very bad, and there was a great storm. The sea was
so heavy and Robinson's ship was in such danger, that
at last they had to cut away the masts in order to ease
her and to stop her from rolling so terribly. The Cap-
tain fired guns to show that his ship wanted help. So
a boat from another ship was lowered, and came with
much difficulty and took off Robinson and all the crew,
just before their vessel sank; and they got ashore at
last, very wet and miserable, having lost all their clothes
except what they had on.
But Robinson had some money in his pocket, and
he went on to London by land, thinking that if he re-
turned home now, people would laugh at him.
In London he made friends with a ship's captain,
who had not long before come home from a voyage
to the Guinea Coast, as that part of Africa was then
called; and the Captain was so pleased with the money
he had made there, that he easily persuaded Robinson
to go with him on his next voyage.
8 The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe
So Robinson took with him toys, and beads, and other
things, to sell to the natives in Africa, and there, he got
in exchange for these things, so much gold dust that he
thought he was soon going in that way to make his for-
tune.
And therefore he went on a second voyage.
But this time he was not so lucky, for before they
reached the African Coast, one morning, very early,
they sighted another ship, which they were sure was a
Pirate. So fast did this other vessel sail, that before
night she had come up to Robinson's ship, which did
not carry nearly so many men nor so many guns as
the Pirate, and which therefore did not want to fight;
and the pirates soon took Robinson and all the crew of
the ship who were not killed, as prisoners and made
slaves of them.
The Pirate captain took Robinson as his own slave,
and made him dig in his garden and work in his house.
Sometimes, too, he made him look after his ship when
she was in port, but he never took him away on a voy-
age.
For two years Robinson lived like this, very unhappy,
and always thinking how he might escape.
At last, when the Captain happened one time to be
at home longer than usual, he began to go out fishing
in a boat two or three times a week, taking Robinson,
who was a very good fisher, and a black boy named
Xury, with him.
One day he gave Robinson orders to put food and
water, and some guns, and powder and shot, on a big
boat that the pirates had taken from an English ship,
and to be ready to go with him and some of his friends
on a fishing trip.
But at the last moment the Captain's friends could
not come, and so Robinson was told to go out in the
boat with one of the Captain's servants who was not
a slave, and with Xury, to catch fish for supper.
When they had gone out about a mile, they hauled
down the sail and began to fish. But Robinson pre-
tended that he could not catch anything there, and he
said that they ought to go further out. When they had
gone so far that nobody on shore could see what they
were doing, Robinson again pretended to fish. But
this time he watched his chance, and when the servant
was not looking, came behind him and threw him over-
board, knowing that the man could swim so well that
he could easily reach the land.
Then Robinson sailed away with Xury down the
coast to the south. He did not know to what country
he was steering, but cared only to get away from the
pirates, and to be free once more.
Long days and nights they sailed, sometimes run-
ning in close to the land, but they were afraid to go
ashore very often, because of the wild beasts and the
natives. Many times they saw great lions come roar-
ing down on to the beach, and once Robinson shot one
that he saw lying asleep, and took its skin to make a bed
for himself on the boat.
At last, after some weeks, when they had got south
as far as the great cape that is called Cape de Verde,
they saw a Portuguese vessel, which took them on
board. It was not easy for Robinson to tell who he
was, because he could not talk Portuguese, but every-
body was very kind to him, and they bought his boat
and his guns and everything that he had. They even
bought poor Xury, who, of course, was a black slave,
and could be sold just like a horse or a dog.
So, when they got to Brazil, where the vessel was
bound, Robinson had enough money to buy a planta-
tion; and he grew sugar and tobacco there for four
years, and was very happy and contented for a time,
and made money.
But he could never be contented for very long. So
when some of his neighbors asked him if he would go
in a ship to the Guinea Coast to get slaves for them, he
went, only making a bargain that he was to be paid
for his trouble, and to get some of the slaves to work on
his plantation when he came back.
Twelve days after the ship sailed, a terrible storm
arose, and they were driven far from where they wanted
to go. Great, angry, foaming seas broke over the deck,
sweeping everything off that could be moved, and a
man and a boy were carried overboard and drowned.
No one on the ship expected to be saved.
This storm was followed by another, even worse.
The wind howled and roared through the rigging, and
the weather was thick with rain and flying spray.
Then early one morning land was dimly seen through
the driving rain, but almost at once the vessel struck
on a sand-bank. In an instant the sails were blown to
ribbons, and flapped with such uproar that no one could
hear the Captain's orders. Waves poured over the
decks, and the vessel bumped on the sand so terribly
that the masts broke off near the deck, and fell over
the side into the sea.
With great difficulty the only boat left on the ship
was put in the water, and everybody got into her.
They rowed for the shore, hoping by chance to get into
some bay, or to the mouth of a river, where the sea
would be quiet.
But before they could reach the land, a huge gray
wave, big like the side of a house, came foaming and
thundering up behind them, and before anyone could
even cry out, it upset the boat, and they were all left
struggling in the water.
Robinson was a very good swimmer, but no man
could swim in such a sea, and it was only good fortune
that brought him at last safely to land. Big wave
after wave washed him further and further up the
beach, rolling him over and over, once leaving him help-
less, and more than half-drowned, beside a rock.
But before the next wave could come up, perhaps
to drag him back with it into the sea, he was able to
jump up and run for his life.
And so he got safely out of the reach of the water,
and lay down upon the grass. But of all on board the
ship, Robinson was the only one who was not drowned.
CHAPTER II
ROBINSON WORKS HARD AT MAKING HIMSELF A HOME
WHEN he had rested a little, Robinson got up and
began to walk about very sadly, for darkness was
coming on; he was wet, and cold, and hungry, and he
did not know where to sleep, because he was afraid of
wild beasts coming out of the woods and killing him dur-
ing the night.
But he found that he still had his knife in his pocket,
so he cut a big stick to protect himself with. Then he
climbed into a tree which had very thick leaves, and
there he fixed himself among the branches as well as he
could, and fell sound asleep.
In the morning when he awoke, the storm was past,
and the sea quieter. To his surprise, he saw that the
ship had during the night been carried by the great seas,
much nearer to the shore than she had been when the
boat left her, and was now lying not far from the rock
where Robinson had first been washed up.
By midday the sea was quite calm, and the tide had
gone so far out that he could walk very near to the
ship. So he took off his clothes and swam the rest of
the way to her. But it was not easy to get on board,
because the ship was resting on the sand, and lay so
high out of the water that Robinson could not reach
anything by which he could pull himself up.
At last, after swimming twice round the vessel, he
saw a rope hanging over, near the bow, and by its help
he climbed on board.
Everything in the stern of the ship was dry, and in
pretty good order, and the water had not hurt the pro-
visions much. So he took some biscuits, and ate them
as he looked about, and drank some rum, and then he
felt better, and stronger, and more fit to begin work.
First of all, he took a few large spars of wood, and
a spare topmast or two, that were on the deck. These
he pushed overboard, tying each with a rope to keep
it from drifting away. Then he went over the side
of the ship, and tied all the spars together so as to make
a raft, and on top he put pieces of plank across. But
it was long before he could make the raft fit to carry
the things he wanted to take on shore.
At last, after much hard work, he got on to it three
of the seamen's chests, which he had broken open and
emptied, and he filled these with bread, and rice, and
cheese, and whatever he could find to eat, and with all
sorts of things that he thought he might need. He
found, too, the carpenter's tool chest, and put it on the
raft; and nothing on the whole ship was of more use to
him than that.
Then he set about looking for clothes, for while he
had been on the ship, the tide had risen and had washed
away his coat and waistcoat and shirt, which he had left
lying on the sand.
Guns and pistols also, and powder and shot, he took,
and two old rusty cutlasses.
Now the trouble was to reach land, for the raft had
no mast nor sail nor rudder, and was too heavy and
clumsy to be pulled by Robinson with the broken oars
that he had found. But the tide was rising, and slowly
she drifted nearer and nearer, and at last was carried
up the mouth of a little river which Robinson had not
seen when he was on shore.
The next thing that Robinson did was to climb a hill,
that he might see what sort of country he was in, and
find out if there were any other people in it. But when
he got to the top, he saw to his sorrow that he was on
an island, with no other land in sight except some rocks,
and two smaller islands far over the sea. There were
no signs of any people, and he saw nothing living ex-
cept great numbers of birds, one of which he shot. But
it was not fit to eat, being some kind of hawk.
After this, with the chests and boards that he had
brought on shore, he made a kind of hut to sleep in that
night, and he lay there on the sand very comfortably.
Day by day now for some time Robinson swam out
to the ship, and made fresh rafts, loading them with
many stores, powder and shot, and lead for bullets,
seven muskets, a great barrel of bread, three casks of
rum, a quantity of flour, some grain, a box of sugar,
sails and ropes and twine, bags of nails, and many
hatchets. With one of the sails he made himself a good
tent, in which he put everything that could be spoiled
by rain or sun. Around it he piled all the casks and
other heavy things, so that no wild beast could very
easily get at him.
In about a fortnight the weather changed; it blew
very hard one night, and in the morning the ship had
broken up, and was no more to be seen. But that did
not so much matter, for Robinson had got out of her
nearly everything that he could use.
Now, Robinson thought it time to find some better
place for his tent. The land where it then stood was
low and near the sea, and the only water he could get
to drink tasted rather salty. Looking about, he found
a little plain, about a hundred yards across, on the side
of a hill, and at the end of the plain was a great rock
partly hollowed out, but not so as quite to make a cave.
Here he pitched his tent, close to the hollow place in
the rock. Around in front of the tent he drove two
rows of strong stakes, about eighteen inches apart,
sharpened at top; and he made this fence so strong that
when it was finished he was sure that nothing could get
at him, for he left no door, but climbed in and out by a
ladder, which he always hauled up after him.
Before closing up the end, Robinson hauled inside
this fence all his stores, his food and his guns, his pow-
der and shot, and he rigged inside a double tent, so bet-
ter to keep off the hot sun and the rain.
Then he began to dig into the rock, which was not
very hard, and soon behind his tent he had a cave in
which he thought it wise to stow his gunpowder, about
one hundred and forty pounds in all, packed in small
parcels; for, he thought, if a big thunderstorm were to
come, a flash of lightning might explode it all, and blow
him to bits, if he kept the whole of it in his tent.
Robinson was now very comfortable, and as he had
saved from the wreck two cats and a dog, he did not
feel quite so lonely. He had got, also, ink and pens
and paper, so that he could keep a diary; and he set
up a large wooden cross, on which he cut with his knife
the date of his landing on the island—30th September
1659; and every day he cut a notch on the post, with a
longer one each Sunday, so that he might always know
how the months and years passed.
As for food, he found that there were many goats
on the island, and numbers of pigeons, and he had no
difficulty in shooting as many as he needed.
But now he saw that his tent and cave were too small
for all the things he had stowed in them, so he began
to make the cave bigger, bringing out all the rock and
soil that he cut down, and making with it a sort of
terrace round the inside of his stockade. And as he
was sure that there were no wild beasts on the island
to harm him, he went on tunneling to the right hand
till he broke through the rock outside his fence.
With all his care, however, there was one thing that
he forgot, and that was, when he had made the cave so
much bigger, to prop it, so as to keep the roof from fall-
ing in. And so one day he got a terrible fright, and
was nearly killed, by a huge piece of the soft rock which
fell and buried many of his things. It took weeks of
hard work afterwards to clear away the fallen rubbish,
and to cut beams strong enough to prop the roof.
Every day, all this time, he used to climb up the
hill and look around over the lonely waters, hoping, al-
ways hoping, that some morning he might see the sails
of a ship that would take him home. But none ever
came, and sometimes the tears ran down his cheeks be-
cause of the sorrow he felt at being so utterly alone.
At times, he thought in his misery that even if only he
had any kind of a boat, it would be better to sail away,
and chance reaching other land, rather than to stop
where he was. By and by, however, he grew less un-
happy, for he had plenty of work to do.
CHAPTER III
THE EARTHQUAKE AND HUBEICANE; AND HOW BOBIN-
SON BUILT A BOAT
"VTOW about this time, when Robinson had been some
The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe 17
gan to fall, and sometimes weeks would pass without
a single dry day. He found that instead of there being
Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, as in England,
the seasons in his island were divided into wet and the
dry. There was no cold weather, no winter. It
chanced that just before this first rain began, Robinson
had emptied out some refuse from bags which had once
held rice and other grain, and he had forgotten all
about having emptied them. So he was very much
astonished to find, some time afterwards, both barley
and rice growing near his tent, in the shade of the rock.
The ears, when ripe, he kept to sow again, and from
this very small beginning, in the course of a few sea-
sons, he had a great quantity of grain, both for food and
for sowing. But this meant every year much hard
work, for he had no plow nor harrow, and all the
ground had to be dug with a clumsy spade, made from
a very hard, heavy wood that grew on the island.
At first Robinson could not grind the grain that he
grew, nor make bread from it. If he could have found
a large stone, slightly hollow on top, he might, by
pounding the grain on it with another round stone, have
made very good meal. But all the stones he could find
were too soft, and in the end he had to make a sort
of mill of hard wood, in which he burnt a hollow place,
and on that he pounded the grain into meal with a
heavy stick.
Baking he did by building a big fire, then raking awaj
the ashes, and putting the dough on the hot place, cov-
ered with a kind of basin made of clay, over which he
heaped the red ashes. In this way very good bread can
be made.
Before the rainy season was over, and just after he
had finished the fence around his tent, one day when
Robinson was at work in the cave, all of a sudden the
earth began to fall from the roof, and the strong props
he had put in cracked in a way which frightened him
terribly. At the same time there was a curious moan-
ing, rumbling noise, that he could not understand. He
rushed out, and so afraid was he that the roof was fall-
ing in, and that he should be buried, that he got over the
fence and began to run.
But he was even more frightened when he found that
all the ground was shaking. Then he knew that this
was an earthquake.
Three times there came violent shocks; a huge rock
about half a mile away fell with a great noise like thun-
der, and the sea was churned up as if by a whirlwind.
Robinson was sick with the movement of the ground,
and trembling with the dread of being swallowed by
the earth as it cracked and gaped; and after the noise
and shaking were over, he was too frightened to go back
to his tent, but sat where he was, all the time expecting
another shock.
For long after this he was very uneasy, and made
up his mind to shift his quarters as soon as he could
find a better place for his tent. But the earthquake
had one good result, for what remained of the wreck
was again thrown up by the sea, and Robinson got more
things out of it which were useful to him, and for days
he worked hard at that. One day, too, when he was
on his way to the remains of the ship, he found a
large turtle, which he killed, and this gave him plenty
of good food, for besides the flesh, there were, inside
the animal, many eggs, which she had come to the shore
to lay in the sand, as is the habit of turtles, and which
Robinson thought were even better than hen's eggs.
Now a few days after he had got so wet in the
heavy rain, though the weather was hot, Robinson felt
very cold and shivery, and had pains all over his body,
and at night he dreamed terrible dreams. The follow-
ing day, and for many days, he lay very ill with fever
and ague, and hardly knew what he was doing. So
weak was he, that he believed he was dying, and there
was no one to give him water to quench his thirst, nor
to help him in any way. His only medicine was rum,
in which he had soaked tobacco. It was very nasty,
and made him sick, but it also made him sleep for more
than a whole day and a night, and he awoke much better,
and able to walk about a little, though for a fortnight
he was too weak to work. From this illness he learned
not to go out more than he could help during the rainy
season.
When he was again quite strong, Robinson started
to explore the island better than he had yet done, and
he found many things growing, of which he made great
use afterwards, tobacco, sugar-cane, and all manner of
fruits, amongst them grapes, which he used to dry to
raisins in the sun in great quantities.
Near the spot where the most fruit grew, he built a
hut, and around it, for safety, he put a double fence
made of stakes cut from some of the trees near at hand.
During the next rainy season these stakes took root,
and grew so fast that soon nothing of the hut could be
seen from outside the hedge, and it made so good a
hiding-place, that Robinson cut more stakes of the
same kind, and planted them outside the fence around
his first dwelling; and in a year or two that also was
quite hidden from view. The twigs of this tree, too,
were good for making baskets, of which he had been in
great need.
When he had finished all this work, he started again
to go over the rest of the island, and on his way across,
from a hill, the day being very clear, he saw high land a
great way off over the water, but whether it was another
island, or the coast of America, he could not be sure.
When he reached the other side of his island Robin-
son found the beach covered with turtles in astonish-
ing numbers, and he thought how much better off he
would have been if he had been cast ashore here, for
not only would the turtles have supplied him with
plenty of food, but there were far more birds than
on the part of the island where he had been living, and
far more goats.
During the journey back to his castle he caught a
young parrot, which, after a long time, he taught to
speak and to call him by his name. It was so long
since he had heard any voice, that it was a comfort to
listen even to a parrot talking.
Now, the sight which Robinson had had of the far
distant land raised in him again the great longing to
get away from this island where he had been so
long alone and he wished greatly for a boat. He
went over to the remains of the boat in which he and
the others had tried to come ashore when their ship
struck on the sand-bank, and which had been flung
far up on the beach by the sea, and he worked for
weeks trying to repair her and to get her into the water.
But it was all of no use; he could not move her.
^ Then, he thought, "I'll cut down a tree, and make a
new boat." This he fancied would be easy, for he had
heard how the Indians make canoes by felling a tree
and burning out the inside. "If they can do it, then
surely I can do it even better," he thought. So he
looked about, and chose a huge tree which stood about
a hundred yards from the water, and with great labor
in about three weeks he had cut it down.
Four months Robinson worked at this boat, think-
ing all the time of what he would do when he reached
the far distant land, and much pleased with himself for
the beautiful boat he was making. Day after day he
trimmed and shaped it, and very proud he was when
it was finished and lay there on the ground, big enough
to carry twenty men.
Then he started to get her into the water. But that
was quite another thing. By no means in his power
could he move her an inch, try as he might. She was
far too big. Then he began to dig a canal from the
sea to the boat; but before he had got much of that
work done, he saw clearly that there was so much
earth to dig away, that, without someone to help him,
it must take years and years before he could get the
water to the boat. So he gave it up, and left her to
lie and rot in the sun and the rain,—a great grief to
him.
CHAPTER IV
ROBINSON BUILDS A SECOND BOAT, IN WHICH HE IS
SWEPT OUT TO SEA
DY the time that Robinson had been four years on
The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe 21
and he had hardly anything that could be called a hat.
Clothes he must have, for he could not go naked with-
out getting his skin blistered by the hot sun, and he
was afraid of getting a sunstroke if he went about
without a hat.
Now he had kept all the skins of the goats, and other
animals, such as hares and foxes, that he had shot; and
from these, after many failures, at last he made a hat
and coat of goatskin, and a pair of short trousers, all
with the hair outside, so as to shoot off the wet when
it rained. The hat was very tall, and came to a sharp
peak on top, and it had a flap which hung down the
back of his neck. Robinson also, with much trouble,
made of the skins an umbrella which he could open and
shut; and if his clothes and his umbrella, and especially
his hat, were not very good to look at, they were useful,
and he could now go about in any weather.
During the next five years nothing out of the com-
mon happened, and Robinson's time was mostly taken
up with the getting of food, the yearly sowing and
reaping of his crops, and the curing of his raisins.
But towards the end of that time he made another
attempt to build a boat, and this time he made one
much smaller than the first, and though it took him
nearly two years to finish, in the end he got her into
the sea. She was not big enough for him to try to
sail in to the far-off land that he had seen, and he used
her only for cruising about the shores of his own island,
and for fishing. In her he fixed a little mast, on which
he rigged a small sail, made from a bit of one of the
old ship's sails, and, using a paddle to steer with, he
found that she sailed very well. Over the stern he
fixed his big umbrella, to shade him from the sun, like
an awning.
Eager to go all round the island, one day Robin-
son put a lot of food on board, and, taking his gun,
started on a voyage. All went well till he came to
the east end of the island, where he found that a ledge
of rocks, and beyond that a sand-bank, stretched out
to sea for eight or nine miles. Robinson did not like
the idea of venturing so far in a boat so small, and he
therefore ran the boat ashore, and climbed a hill, to
get a good view of the rocks and shoals before going
near them. From the hill, he saw that a strong cur-
rent was sweeping past the sand-bank, which showed
just clear of the water, and on which the sea was break-
ing; but he thought there was an eddy which would
swing him safely round the point, without bringing
him near the breakers. However, that day and the
next, there was a good deal of wind blowing in the di-
rection contrary to the current, which, of course, raised
a sea too big for a small boat, so Robinson stopped on
shore where he was.
On the third day it was calm, and he set off. But
no sooner had he come abreast of the sand-bank than
he found himself in very deep water, with a current
running like a mill-race, which carried the boat fur-
ther and further away from the land, in spite of all
that he could do with his paddle. There was no wind,
so the sail was useless.
Now he gave himself up for lost, for the harder he
worked, the further away the boat seemed to be
swept. The island was soon so far off that Robinson
could hardly see it, and he was quite exhausted with the
hard struggle to paddle the boat against the current.
He was in despair, and giving up paddling, left the
boat to drift where she would. Just then a faint puff
of wind touched his cheek, and Robinson hurriedly
hoisted his sail. Soon a good breeze blew, which car-
ried him past a dangerous reef of rocks. Here the
current seemed to divide, the part in which he now
was began to swing round towards the island, and he
plucked up heart again, and with his paddle did all
he could to help the sail. Robinson felt like a man who
is set free after he has been told that he must die; he
could almost have wept for joy. Miles and miles he
sailed, steadily getting nearer to the land, and late in
the evening he at last got ashore, but on the other side
of the point that he had tried to round in the morning.
He drew up his boat on the shore of a little cove that
he found, and when he had made her fast, so that the
tide could not carry her away, there amongst the trees
he lay down, and slept sound, quite worn out.
In the morning he again got on board, and coasted
along close inshore, till he came to a bay with a little
river running into it which made a very good harbor
for the boat. Here he left her, and went on foot.
Soon he found that he was not far from a spot that
he had once before visited, and by afternoon he arrived
at the hut which he called his country-house. Robin-
son got over the fence by the ladder, as usual, pulling
it up after him, and then he lay down to rest in the
shade, for he was still very weary from the hard work
of the day before. Soon he fell asleep. But what
was his surprise in a little time to be awakened by a
voice calling, "Robin! Robin Crusoe! where are you?"
At first he thought he was dreaming. But still the
voice went on calling:
"Where are you, Robin?"
Up he jumped, trembling with fright and wonder,
for it was so long since he had heard any voice but
his own that he fancied it must be something more than
human that he now listened to. But no sooner had
he risen than he saw, sitting on a tree near to him, his
parrot, which must have flown all the way from Rob-
inson's other house, where he had been left. It was
talking away at a great rate, very excited at again
seeing its master, and Robinson hardly knew whether
to be more relieved or disappointed that it was only
the bird that had called him.
For about a year after this Robinson kept to his
own side of the island, and employed his time chiefly
in working on his land, and in making dishes and pots
of clay. These he had now learned to burn properly.
Pipes, too, he made, and they were a great comfort to
him, for he managed to cure very good tobacco from
the wild plants that grew around. And as he feared
lest his powder might begin to run short, he thought
much over ways whereby he could trap goats for food,
instead of shooting them. After many trials, the best
plan, he decided, was to dig holes, which he covered
with thin branches and leaves, on which he sprinkled
earth, so that when anything heavy passed over, it must
fall into the pit. By this means he caught many, and
the kids he kept and tamed, so that in no great time
he had quite a large herd of goats. These he kept in
various small fields, round which from time to time
he had put fences.
CHAPTER V
ROBINSON SEES A FOOTPRINT ON THE SAND, AND FINDS
TRACES OF CANNIBAL FEASTS
/"~\NE day when Robinson was walking along the sand
^S towards his boat, suddenly, close to the water, he
stopped as if he had been shot, and, with thumping
heart, stood staring in wonder and fear at something
that he saw. The mark of a naked foot on the sand!
It could not be his own, he knew, for the shape was
quite different. Whose could it be?
He listened, he looked about, but nothing could he
hear or see. To the top of a rising ground he ran,
and looked all around. There was nothing to be seen.
And though he searched everywhere on the beach for
more footmarks, he found none.
Whose footprint could it be? That of some man,,
perhaps, he thought, who might come stealing on him
out from the trees, or murder him whilst he slept.
Back to his house he hurried, all the way in a state
of terror, starting every now and again and facing
round, thinking he was being followed, and fancying
often that a stump or a bush was a man, waiting to
spring on him. That night he slept not at all, and so
shaken was his nerve that every cry of a night bird,
even every sound made by an insect or a frog, caused
himvto start with fear, so that the perspiration ran down
his brow.
As day followed day, however, and nothing hap-
pened, Robinson began to be less uneasy in his
mind, and went about his usual work again. But he
strengthened the fence round his castle, and cut in it
seven small loop-holes, in which, fixed on frames, he
placed loaded muskets, all ready to fire if he should
be attacked. And some distance from the outside of
the fence he planted a thick belt of small stakes, so
that in a few years' time a perfect thicket of trees and
bushes hid all trace of his dwelling.
Years passed quietly, and nothing further happened
to disturb Robinson, or to make him think more of
the footprint that had frightened him so much. But
he kept more than formerly to the interior of the island,
and lost no chance of looking for good places to hide in,
if he should ever need them- And he always carried
a cutlass now, as well as his gun and a couple of pistols.
One day it chanced, however, that he had gone fur-
ther to the west of the island than he had ever been
before, and, looking over the sea, he fancied that he
saw, at a great distance, something like a boat or a
long canoe, but it was so far off that he could not be
sure what it was. This made him determine that al-
ways in future he would bring with him to his lookout-
\

HE SAW THE MARK OF A NAKED FOOT IN THE SAND.
place the telescope which he had saved from the wreck.
The sight of this supposed boat brought back his
uneasiness to some extent, but he went on down to
the beach, and there he saw a sight which filled him
with horror. All about the shore were scattered men's
skulls and bones, and bits of burnt flesh, and in one
place were the remains of a big fire. Robinson stood
aghast, feeling deadly sick. It was easy for him to
know the meaning of the terrible sight. It meant that
cannibals had been there, killing and eating their
prisoners; for when the natives of some parts of the
world go to war, and catch any of their enemies, it is
their habit to build a fire, then to kill the prisoners and
feast on their roasted bodies, eating till they can eat
no more. Sometimes, if the man they are going to eat
is too thin, they keep him, and feed him up, till they
think he is fat enough.
Full of horror, Robinson hurried back to his house,
and for almost two years he never again came near that
part of the island where the bones lay, nor ever visited
his boat. But all the time he kept thinking how he
might some day kill those cannibals whilst they were at
their feast, and perhaps save some of the poor men
whom they had not yet killed. Sometimes he thought of
putting powder below the place where they were likely
to light their fire, and thus blow them up. But that
did not seem a very good plan, because he did not
want to waste his powder, and may be they might not
light the fire on that spot, or they might not be
near when it exploded. So he looked for a place where
he could hide, near where the bones lay, and at last he
found a good spot, from which he could watch them
land. Near this spot were trees through which he could
creep up quite close to them, unseen, and so shoot with-
out danger of missing. And it was his plan, that if
he should happen to see the savages next time they
came over for one of their horrible feasts, he would
lie hidden till a good chance came, then shoot as many
as he could with his gun and pistols, and afterwards
with his cutlass rush upon those that were left. In
this way he counted on being able to kill them all, even
if there were as many as twenty, for they would be
taken by surprise, and in the confusion might not be
able to get at their spears and clubs.
When he had made this plan, Robinson was so
pleased with it that for a time he could think of little
else, and every day he would walk three miles to his
lookout-hill, and watch through his telescope for signs
of canoes coming over the sea towards the island. But
after two or three months without result, he grew tired
of it. Never a speck was to be seen on the water in
any direction, and he began to go less and less often
to the lookout-hill, and then gave up going altogether.
Perhaps too, he thought, it was no business of his; the
savages did not know any better, and were only doing
what their fathers had taught them to do. It was the
custom in these savage lands and Robinson came to
think, finally, that he had no right to interfere, unless
they first attacked him. He argued also that if he did
attack, and it chanced that he did not kill them all, that
even only one got away, for certain that man would
tell his tribe as soon as he got home, and they would
come over in hundreds to murder Robinson in revenge
for the death of those he had killed. And no doubt
they would eat him, the thought of which was very
dreadful.
More than ever now, Robinson kept to his two
houses, and seldom left them, except to go to a deep
Valley he had found, through which ran a little stream
of water as clear as crystal, and in which he now kept
most of his goats, secured by a fence built all round
the valley. He almost gave up firing his gun, lest it
should bring the savages to find out the cause of the
noise; and for the same reason he feared even to chop
wood or to drive a nail. He was particularly careful,
too, never to make a fire during the day, for nothing is
so easily seen from a distance as smoke, and it would
certainly bring the savages on him, if they were on
the island, or anywhere near it.
Presently, he began to make charcoal, by burning
wood under earth and turf, and this charcoal he often
took home to his house to use for cooking his food, be-
cause charcoal makes no smoke.
CHAPTER VI
ROBINSON FINDS A CAVE; HEARS GUNS FIRED BY A
SHIP IN DISTRESS
NOW one day when Robinson was down in the bot-
tom of the valley, cutting thick branches to burn
for charcoal, he cleared away some undergrowth at the
foot of a great rock, in which, near the ground, there
was a sort of hole, or opening. Into this hole Robin-
son squeezed, not very easily, and found himself in a
cave of good size, high enough, at least, to stand up in.
It was quite dark, of course, to him coming in from
the sunlight, and he turned his back to the entrance
to feel his way further in, when suddenly, from the
back of the cave he saw two great fiery eyes glaring at
him. His very hair bristled with fright, for he could
only think that it must be the Devil at least that he
saw; and through the mouth of the cave he fled with a
yell.
But when he got into the bright sunshine he began to
feel ashamed of his panic, and to reason with himself
that what he had seen must be only his own fancy.
So, taking up a big burning branch from his fire, in
he went again.
Before Robinson had taken three steps he stopped,
in almost as great a fright as at first. Close to him
he heard a great sigh, as if of some one in pain, then
a sound like a muttering, as of words that he could
not understand; again another deep sigh. Cold sweat
broke out all over him, and he stepped back trembling,
yet determined this time not to run away.
Holding his torch well over his head, he looked
around, and there on the floor of the cave lay a huge
old he-goat, gasping for breath, dying, seemingly of
mere old age.
He stirred him with his toe to see if he could get
him out of the cave, but the poor beast could not rise,
and Robinson left him to die where he was.
Now that he had got over his fright, Robinson
looked carefully about him. The cave was small, not
more than twelve feet across at its widest, but he
noticed at the far end another opening. This was so
low down, however, that he had to creep on his hands
and knees to get in, and without a better light than the
burning torch, he could not see how far it went. So
he made up his mind to come again.
Robinson had long before this made a good supply
of very fair candles from the tallow of the goats he
had killed, and next day he returned to the cave with
six of these, and his tinder-box to light them with. In
those days there were no matches, and men used to
strike a light with a flint and steel, and tinder, which
was a stuff that caught fire very easily from a spark.
Entering the cave, Robinson found, on lighting a
candle, that the goat was now dead. Moving it aside,
to be buried later, he went down on his hands and
knees, and crawled about ten yards through the small
passage, till at last he found himself in a great
chamber, the roof of which was quite twenty feet high.
On every side the walls reflected the light of his candle,
and glittered like gold, or almost like diamonds, he
thought. The floor was perfectly dry and level, even
on the walls there was no damp, and Robinson was
delighted with his discovery. Its only drawback was
the low entrance; but, as he decided to use the cave
chiefly as a place to retreat to if he should ever be at-
tacked, that was in reality an advantage, because one
man, if he had firearms, could easily defend it against
hundreds.
At once Robinson set about storing in it all his
powder, except three or four pounds, all his lead for
making bullets, and his spare guns and muskets.
When moving the powder, he thought he might as well
open a barrel which had drifted ashore out of the wreck
after the earthquake, and though water had got into
it, there was not a great deal of damage done, for the
powder had crusted on the outside only, and in the
inside there was about sixty pounds weight, quite dry
and good. This, with what remained of the first lot,
gave him a very large supply, enough to last all his
life.
For more than twO-and-twenty years Robinson had
now been in the island, and he had grown quite used to
it, and to his manner of living. If he could only have
been sure that no savages would come near him, he felt
almost that he would be content to spend all the rest
of his days there, to die at last, as the goat he found in
the cave had died, of old age.
It was near the end of the month of December, his
harvest time, and Robinson used then to be much out
in his fields even before daylight. One morning, be-
ing anxious to finish cutting the crop, he had left his
house even earlier than usual, long before the stars had
ceased to shine or the first flush of dawn had showed in
the sky, and as he crossed the higher lying ground be-
tween his castle and the cornfield, it chanced that he
glanced in the direction of the sea.
There, on the shore, to his great horror on his own
side of the island, he saw a fire burning, and he knew
that this could only have been lit by the cannibals,
who had once more landed.
Straight back to his castle he ran, and climbed hur-
riedly over the fence, pulling the ladder up after him.
Quickly he loaded all his muskets and pistols, ready to
defend himself to the last gasp, for he was sure that,
if these savage men should happen to see his crops
growing in the fields, they would know that someone
was living on the island, and would never rest till they
found him.
But when Robinson had waited some time without
anything happening, he could bear the suspense no
longer. Taking the telescope, he put his ladder
against the rock where there was a flat ledge, and climb-
ing up to this, pulled the ladder after him, and again
resting it there, so climbed to the top of the rock, where
he lay down and looked eagerly through the glass.
There were no less than nine savages, he saw, all
sitting round the fire, cooking something, but what it
was that they cooked he could not tell, though it was
not difficult to guess.
After a time they began a kind of dance around the
fire, all of them stark naked, and Robinson watched
them at this for nearly two hours.
The cannibals had two canoes, which were hauled
up on the shore, and as it was then low water he
fancied they must be waiting for the tide to rise again.
And so it turned out, for when the tide had been
flowing for a time, they shoved off, jumped on board,
and paddled away.
As soon as Robinson was sure that they were really
gone, he went with all his speed to the hill from where,
first of all, long ago, he had seen signs of savages, and
looking through his glass, he saw three more canoes at
sea, all paddling away from the island. On going
down to the shore, there he saw a dreadful sight.
Skulls, bits of flesh, and bones, lay about, and fresh
blood was everywhere, hardly yet soaked into the sand.
This awful sight so horrified and roused Robinson
that once more he determined, whenever the next
chance came, to attack the cannibals, however many
there might be, and kill all that he could. But always,
for long after, he lived in great uneasiness, never sure
that at any moment he might not be taken by surprise.
Often he wished the time had come when he could run
at them; for suspense is always harder to bear than any
action, however dangerous.
But many months went by, and no savages were
seen, and nothing disturbed Robinson except dreadful
dreams, from which in the night he often started out
of his sleep, crying out and struggling, thinking that
the savages were trying to kill him.
About the middle of the following May, one day
there came a very great storm, with much thunder and
lightning and rain, and during the night the wind blew
a perfect hurricane. Robinson was sitting listening to
the roaring of the wind, and sometimes reading the
Bible which he had found in one of the seamen's chests,
for he could not sleep.
Suddenly he was startled by a kind of dull thud that
seemed to shake the very air, such a thud as you might
hear if something very heavy, but soft, fell on the floor
of a room upstairs. And this noise was followed in
about a minute by another thud. This time he could
hear plainer, and he knew that the sounds were those
of big guns fired at sea, and that they must come from
some ship in danger, and signaling for help, perhaps
to some other vessel.
Robinson ran out, and climbing up his ladder, got to
the top of the rock in time to see the flash of another
gun, away towards the reef of rocks at the end of the
island.
If he was not able to help the people on board the
vessel, they might yet, if they were saved, help him, so
he collected all the dry wood he could get, and making
a great pile, set fire to it, as a signal to the ship that
there was someone on the island. And he was sure
that the signal was seen, for as soon as it blazed up an-
other gun was fired; then gun after gun, for some time.
Robinson kept his fire blazing all night, and when
daylight came, and the storm cleared off, he thought
he could see, away to the east, something which looked
like a ship. He fancied she was at anchor, for she
never moved. But the distance was too great, and
the weather too thick for him to be sure if it was a
ship at all that he saw.
Later in the day, when the weather had cleared, on
going up the hill from which, long ago, he had watched
the current sweeping past the rocks, he could see
plainly that there was a vessel, but to his sorrow, that
she was a wreck, fast on the reef where, the day he
was carried out to sea, he had found the current divide.
Without doubt the crew must have perished. And
it filled Robinson with sadness and great grief to think
how near he had been perhaps to fellow countrymen,
and how not even one had been spared to come ashore.
His whole soul yearned for the sight of a white man,
someone to whom he could speak. But all that ever
he saw of the crew, except what he afterwards found
on the ship itself, was the body of a boy, which drifted
on shore at the end of the island nearest the wreck;
and he could not tell from the few clothes that were on
the body to what nation the boy had belonged. In
his pockets were two gold coins, and a tobacco pipe,
and the last at least was of use to Robinson.
CHAPTER VII
ROBINSON VISITS THE WRECKED SPANISH SHIP;
RESCUES A PRISONER FROM THE CANNIBALS
WHEN the weather had again become calm and
settled, Robinson was greatly tempted to venture
out in his boat to the wreck, in spite of the narrow
escape he had had before at that place; but there might
still, he thought, be someone alive on board, and he
made up his mind to risk it. This time he put a
compass in the boat, and great store of food and water,
as much as she could well carry, and he pushed off,
paddling along the shore till he came near to the end
of the sand-bank where the current ran so strong.
And there his heart failed him. If he once got into
that current, how was he to get out of it again? And
if he were swept out to sea, and a gale of wind sprang
up, what chance was there that his small boat would
live through it? He was so cast down by these
thoughts that he ran the boat ashore and got out.
Going on to a high rock he sat for hours watching
the water, trying to make up his mind whether to ven-
ture to the wreck or not, when he noticed that the cur-
rent was now running in the direction contrary to that
in which it had been flowing the first time he saw it.
This, it occurred to him, must be caused by the tides,
and it seemed likely that if he chose his time, the cur-
rent going one way would carry him close to the wreck,
and that caused by the next tide would help him back
again.
This seemed so simple and easy that he determined
to risk it next day. Sleeping that night in the canoe,
early in the morning he started, and in a little more
than two hours safely reached the wreck, without any
trouble.
She was a pitiful sight,—Spanish, he judged, from
her build. She was lying on the reef, jammed fast
between two rocks, the after part of her all stove in by
the sea. Her main and foremasts had gone over the
side when she struck, and hung about the wreck in a
tangle of rigging and spars. Her bulwarks, and rails,
and the poop ladders, were all gone, and part of one
boat still hung on the davits, torn away by the furious
sea before the crew could attempt to lower it. On
board, there was no living thing except a dog, which
yelped when it saw Robinson coming, and jumped into
the sea, and swam eagerly to him when he spoke to it.
Poor beast! It was almost dead from thirst. Robinson
gave it water, and food, and it drank till he was almost
afraid it might burst itself.
After this, Robinson boarded the wreck, and the first
thing he saw was two men lying in the cook's galley,
dead, held fast in each other's arms. Beyond this there
was no trace of any human being, and the cargo, what-
ever it might have been, had mostly been washed out
of the wreck by the sea. There were still a few casks
of brandy, or wine, low down in the hold, but they were
too heavy for Robinson to move.
Some chests there were in the forecastle, which most
likely had belonged to some of the crew. Two of these
Robinson got into his boat, along with a small cask of
liquor, and other things; a powder-horn full of powder,
a fire-shovel and tongs (which he had always much
needed), two little brass kettles, a copper pot, and a
gridiron. These, and the dog, were all that he got
from the wreck. The dog was a great comfoTt to him,
for the animal he had brought ashore from his own
ship had now been dead many years.
Except what he found in the seamen's chests, there
was nothing of value in the cargo he brought ashore.
In the chests were many things that he prized, linen
shirts, handkerchiefs, and colored neckcloths, pots of
sweetmeats, a case of bottles of cordial waters, very
handsomely mounted with silver, and, what then was of
less value to him, three great bags of gold pieces, be-
sides gold doubloons, and bars of gold. But all this
gold he would gladly have given then for a few pairs
of English shoes and stockings, for it was of no use at
all to him on the island. However, he stowed all the
money and the gold in his cave, along with the other
things, and then returned and worked his boat along
shore to the harbor where he had kept her so long.
But the sight of the wrecked ship and the drowned
men had filled him again with the longing to go away,
and if he had had as good a boat as that in which he
escaped from the pirates, he thought that he would
have waited no longer on the island, but would have put
to sea in her, and taken his chance of reaching some
land where white men dwelt. With the frail craft that
he had, however, such a plan was not possible, and he
had no choice but to go on living as he had already so
long lived, all the time in daily fear of a raid by the
savages.
One night, when he had put himself almost into a
fever with the trouble of his mind, he had lain long
awake, tossing and moaning, but at last he had fallen
asleep. And he dreamed, not as he had usually done
of late, that he was sailing to the mainland, but that as
he was leaving his castle in the morning he saw on the
shore two canoes and eleven savages landing, and that
they had with them another man, whom they were
just about to kill and eat, when suddenly the prisoner
jumped up and ran for his life. And in his dream
Robinson fancied that the man came running to hide
in the thicket round the castle, and that thereupon he
went out to help him. Then in the dream, the savage
kneeled down, as if begging for mercy, and Robinson
took him over the ladder into the castle, saying to him-
self, "Now that I've got this fellow, I can certainly go
to the mainland, for he will show me what course to
steer, and where to go when we land." And he woke,
with the joyful feeling that now at last all was well.
But when he was wide awake, and knew that it was only
a dream after all, poor Robinson was more cast down
than ever, and more unhappy than he had been during
all the years he had lived on the island.
The dream had, however, this result; that he saw his
only plan to get away was, if possible, to rescue some
day one of the prisoners whom the cannibals were about
to kill, and in time get the man to help him to navigate
his canoe across the sea.
With this idea, he set himself to watch, more closely
than ever he had done before, for the savages to land,
and during more than a year and a half he went nearly
every day to his lookout-place, and swept the sea with
his telescope, in the hope of seeing canoes coming. But
none came, and Robinson was getting terribly tired of
the constant watch. Still he did not give up, for he
knew that sooner or later the savages would land again.
v 3Tet many months passed, and still they did not come,
till one morning, very early, almost to his surprise, he
saw no fewer than five canoes hauled up on the shore
on his own side of the island. The savages who had
come in them were nowhere to be seen. Now, he knew
that always from four to six men came in each canoe,
which meant that at least twenty, and perhaps as many
as thirty men had landed.
This was a greater number than he cared to face, so
he kept inside his castle, in great doubt what to do, but
ready to fight, in case they should attack him.
When he had waited a long time and still could hear
nothing of the savages, he climbed up his ladder and
got to the top of the rock, taking great care not to show
himself against the sky-line. Looking through his
glass, he saw that there were at least thirty savages,
dancing wildly around a fire.
As he looked, some of the men left the others, and
going over to the canoes dragged from them two prison-
ers. One of these almost at once fell forward on his
face, knocked down from behind, as it seemed to Robin-
son, with a wooden club, and two or three of the can-
nibals at once cut him open to be ready for cooking,
whilst for a moment or two they left the other prisoner
standing by himself.
Seeing a chance of escape, the man made a dash for
his life, running with tremendous speed along the sands
straight for that part of the beach near Robinson's
castle.
Now this alarmed Robinson very much, for it seemed
to him that the whole of the savages started after the
prisoner. He could not help thinking it likely that, as
in his dream, this man would take shelter in the thicket
round the castle, in which case Robinson was likely soon
to have more fighting than he would relish, for the
whole body of the cannibals would be on him at once.
As he watched the poor man racing for life, however,
he was relieved to see that he ran much faster than his
pursuers, of whom only three continued to run after
him. If he could hold out for another mile or two there
was little doubt that he would escape. Between the
castle and the runners was the creek up which Robinson
used to run his rafts from the wreck, and when the es-
caped prisoner came to that, he plunged in, and though
the tide was full, with less than thirty powerful strokes
he reached the other side, and with long easy strides
continued his run. Of the men in pursuit, two also
plunged in and swam through, but less quickly than the
man escaping, being more blown with running, because
of what they had eaten before starting. The third man
stopped altogether, and went back the way he came.
Seeing the turn things were taking, it seemed to
Robinson that now had come his chance to get a serv-
ant, and he resolved to try to save the life of the man
who was fleeing from the cannibals. At once he hur-
ried down the ladder, snatched up his two guns, and
running as fast as he could, got between the man and
his pursuers, calling out to him at the same time to stop.
The man looked back, and the sight of Robinson
seemed to frighten him at first as much as did the men
who were trying to catch him. But Robinson again
spoke, and signed to him with his hand to come back,
and in the meantime went slowly towards the other men,
men, who were now coming near. Then, rushing at
the foremost, he knocked him senseless with the butt of
his gun, for it seemed to him safer not to fire, lest the
noise should bring the other cannibals around.
The second man, seeing his comrade fall, hesitated,
and stopped, but Robinson saw when nearer to him
that the savage had in his hands a bow and arrow with
which he was just about to shoot, There was then no
choice but to fire first, which Robinson did, killing the
man on the spot.
Thereupon the man who had been chased by the
others was so terrified by the flash and noise of the gun,
and at seeing his enemy fall dead, that he stood stock
still, trembling, and it was with great difficulty that
Robinson coaxed him to come near. This at last he
did, stopping every few paces and kneeling down. At
length, coming close to Robinson, he again knelt, kissed
the ground, and taking hold of Robinson's foot, set it
on his head as it rested on the sand.
Whilst this was going on, Robinson noticed that the
savage whom he had knocked down had begun to move,
and to come to his senses. To this he drew the atten-
tion of the man whom he had rescued, who said some
words that Robinson could not understand, but which
sounded pleasant to an ear that had heard no voice but
his own for more than twenty-five years. Next he
made a motion with his hand, as if asking for the cutlass
that hung at Robinson's belt, and when the weapon was
given to him he ran at his enemy, and with one clean
blow cut off his head. Then, laughing, he brought the
head, and laid it with the cutlass at Robinson's feet.
Calling him away, Robinson now took him, not to
his castle, but to the cave, where he gave him food and
water; and then he made signs for him to lie down and
rest, pointing to a bundle of rice straw.
Soon the man was sound asleep. He was, Robinson
thought, a handsome and well-made man; the muscles
of his arms and back and legs showed great strength,
and all his limbs were beautifully formed. As near as
Robinson could guess, he was about twenty-six years
of age, with a good and manly face, and long black
hair. His nose and lips were like those of a European,
and his teeth were white and even. In color he was
not black, but of a sort of rich chocolate brown, the skin
shining with health, and pleasant to look upon.
CHAPTER VIII
HOW EOBINSON TRAINED "FRIDAY"
"I717HILST the man slept, Robinson went out to milk
* * his goats, at which work the savage, having waked
in about half an hour, found him, and running up,
threw himself on the ground near Robinson's feet, one
of which he again raised as before, and placed on his
head. At the same time he made every kind of sign of
gratitude and submission.
In a little while Robinson began to speak to him, and
to try to teach him things. First, he made him under-
stand that his name was to be "Friday" (that being the
day of the week when Robinson had saved him from a
horrible death). Then he taught him the meaning of
"Yes," and "No," and to call Robinson, "Master."
Friday showed great quickness in learning. He
seemed to be happy and contented, and free from
trouble, except that the clothes which Robinson made
him wear gave him at first great discomfort, for in those
warm parts of the world the natives are not used to
clothes, but always go about naked. And perhaps they
are healthier so, for when rain comes, they can cover
their skin with cocoanut oil, and the wet then runs off
their bodies without chilling them, and they do not catch
cold by wearing damp clothes.. Sometimes they make
drooping girdles of the broad leaves of the banana,
which are two or three feet long, and wear these around
their waists; and sometimes, for ornament, they stick
crimson flowers behind their ears, or hang them around
their necks. But other clothes they have none to wear.
The day following that on which Robinson had saved
THE MAN KNELT AND KISSED THE GROUND.
Friday, they went out together to see if there were any
signs of the cannibals still being on the island, but it
was evident that they had gone away without troubling
about the two men whom Robinson had killed. Round
the place where their fire had been, were horrible re-
mains of bodies, pieces of flesh half eaten, or charred
by the fire, skulls, hands, and bones of legs and feet.
Friday made Robinson understand that these were the
remains of three prisoners who had been brought over
along with him, to be feasted on.
Robinson's blood ran cold as he looked, and the hor-
ror of the sight made him sick and faint. He ordered
Friday to collect all the bodies and other remains, and
to build a fire to burn them, which Friday very cheer-
fully did. To him it was no great matter, for, of
course, all his life he himself had been a cannibal, and
he was quite used to such scenes. Indeed, when they
passed the spot where the two men had been buried in
the sand, Friday pointed it out to Robinson, and gave
him to understand that he meant to come back, and dig
up and eat the bodies. This filled Robinson with dis-
gust and rage, and he let Friday know that he would
be severely punished, perhaps killed, if ever such a thing
was done by him.
For some time Robinson did not trust Friday, and
did not allow him to sleep in the same part of his castle
with himself, but kept him at night in a little tent out-
side the fence. Every night he drew up the ladder,
so that if Friday ever should attempt to get over, he
would be sure to make noise enough to wake Robinson.
Other precautions also he took, but soon he found that
they were not needed. Friday was quite faithful.
And he was never sulky nor lazy, but always merry,
and ready to do anything that Robinson told him.
And as time went on, Robinson did not doubt that if
there should ever be need for it, Friday would risk his
life to save his master.
At first when they went out in the woods together,
Friday was terrified each time that Robinson's gun was
fired. He had never seen anything put into it, and it
was more than he could understand how things could
be killed merely by the noise and the flash of fire. It
seemed to him that the gun was some sort of evil spirit
that might do him harm, and it was long before he could
be brought to touch one of them, though when he was
alone Robinson often heard him talking to them. Aft-
erwards, when he could speak English better, and knew
more about guns, he told Robinson that he used to
ask them not to kill him.
Robinson asked Friday if his tribe ever came to this
island, and Friday said that they did, and that he him-
self had often come over; and he told Robinson that on
one visit he and his friends had eaten more than twenty
men. His tribe, he said, was very strong, and fought
well. Thus they took more prisoners, and used the
island oftener than the other tribes, and it seemed that
the far side of the island, where Robinson had seen so
many remains of feasts, was the part that Friday's
tribe held as their own. Sometimes other tribes used
another island for their feasts.
It troubled Robinson's mind greatly to hear what
Friday had to say about this custom, but by little and
little, as the weeks went past, he got him to see how hor-
rible a thing it was to eat human flesh. From this be-
ginning, Friday gradually came to be in his habits more
like a white man, and teaching him was a great joy to
Robinson, who found the years after Friday's arrival
the happiest of all that he had lived on the island. Not
only had he now help in his work, but he had someone
to talk to, for want of which, during the weary years
when he was alone, he had almost forgotten his own
tongue.
When they began easily to understand each other,
Robinson asked Friday how far it was from the island
to his country, and if the canoes were not often lost
whilst crossing. Friday said there was no danger, and
that no canoes were ever wrecked; that always in the
morning the wind and the current set one way, and the
other in the afternoon. This Robinson thought must
have something to do with the tides, but afterwards he
learned that the change of wind was only the difference
between the sea breeze and the land breeze, which blow
alternately, morning and evening, in those parts. The
change in the current was due to the in-draft and out-
draft of a great river, off whose mouth the island lay.
Friday told Robinson much about his country, and
about his people, who he said were Caribs. And a
great way "beyond the moon," by which he meant to the
west, he said that white men lived who had beards such
as Robinson wore. These white men, he said, had
killed very many natives, from which Robinson fancied
that they must be Spaniards, who about that time were
very cruel to the people whose countries they had taken.
Robinson asked if Friday could tell him how he
might get over to where the white men lived, and Fri-
day said it would be very easy, if they had a big canoe.
And again Robinson began to make plans and to hope
to escape from the island. He showed Friday the boat
in which he and the crew had tried to land from the
wreck, the remains of which still lay high up on the
shore, out of reach of the waves of any but a very high
tide, or of a storm worse than common. Friday looked
long at it without speaking, till Robinson asked what he
was thinking of.
Then he said that he had once before seen such a
boat, but for some time he could not make Robinson un-
derstand where, or when, he had seen it. Robinson
thought he meant that a ship had been driven ashore on
the coast, and that the boat, perhaps, had come from her.
But presently Friday spoke of the men who had been
in the boat, and whom he and his people had pulled out
of the sea. He counted on his fingers to make Robin-
son understand that there had been seventeen of them.
"Where are they now?" Robinson asked; and Friday
said they still lived with his tribe.
This put new ideas into Robinson's head, for he
thought that probably these men might have belonged
to the ship whose guns he had heard, and to which he
had afterwards gone out in his boat as she lay on the
reef.
Friday said that his people had given the men food,
and had not hurt them.
"Why did they not kill and eat them?" asked Robin-
son; and again Friday assured him that they ate men
only whom they took in war.
It was some time after this that Robinson and Friday
chanced to be on the high hill at the east end of the
island. The day was cloudless and very clear, with a
light breeze rippling the water, just such a day as that
on which, years ago, Robinson had seen land, far over
the sea. Friday gazed long in that direction, and then
began to jump and dance, pointing to the dim blue
coast. "There my country! See! There my people
live!" he said, his eyes sparkling with joy, and an eager
light on his face.
After this, for a time Robinson was not easy in his
mind about Friday. He had little doubt that if he
could get back to his tribe, he would soon forget all he
had been taught, all that Robinson had done for him,
might even return, perhaps, with a hundred or two of
his friends, and kill and eat his master. But in this
Robinson was very unjust to Friday, who had no such
thoughts in his mind as those of which he was suspected.
And this Robinson soon found out. One day, as
they walked up the same hill, he asked if Friday would
not be glad to be once more in his own land.
"Yes," said Friday; "very glad."
"Would you eat men's flesh again?"
"No, never," said Friday, shaking his head very
much.
Then Robinson asked why he did not go back. It
was too far to swim, said Friday. Robinson said he
would give him a boat, and Friday said, very well, he
would go if Robinson came too.
"But your people will eat me," said Robinson.
"No, no," Friday answered; "you good to me. They
good to you."
Robinson had then more than half a mind to go, for
if he could join the other white men, he thought there
would be a better cHance to build a boat big enough to
sail in to England.
So he took Friday to the place where he kept the
small canoe he had made, and quickly he found that he
was a very much better boatman than Robinson him-
self, and could make her go through the water nearly
twice as fast as Robinson was able to do.
But when Robinson asked if they might try to go
over in that boat, Friday's face fell. She was too small,
he said. Robinson then showed him the first boat he
had built, and which had been lying on the sand now
for more than twenty-two years. That, Friday said,
was big enough. But the heat of the sun by this time
had so warped and cracked her that, even if they could
have got her into the sea, she would not have floated.
Then Robinson told Friday that he would build him
a bigger boat, and send him home in it, but that he him*
self would remain on the island alone, as he had been
before.
The poor lad's feelings were hurt at this, and he
asked, "Why you angry mad with Friday? Suppose
master go, Friday go! Suppose master no go, Friday
no go I" And he brought a hatchet, and said, "You
kill Friday! not send him away." Robinson was much
touched by this devotion, and afterwards always had
perfect faith in him.
CHAPTER IX
"^
EOBINSON AND FRIDAY BUILD A LARGE BOAT;
THEY RESCUE TWO PRISONERS FROM
THE CANNIBALS
DUT still the wish to leave the island was as strong
"*-* as ever, and together he and Friday went to work
to fell a tree from which to build a boat good enough
for their voyage to the mainland. Friday soon showed
that he knew far better than Robinson the kind of tree
best suited for boat-making, though he knew less about
hollowing it out; for he had never seen tools suitable for
such work. Friday proposed to burn out the inside,
but Robinson showed him how to use the tools, and soon
he was very handy with them.
It took the two of them little more than a month to
finish the boat. And very handsome she looked, and
very proud of her they were. But it cost them quite a
fortnight of very hard work to get her into the water.
Below her they had to put large wooden rollers, and
then with strong sticks, inch by inch, they levered and
pushed her into the sea, where she floated, very trim
and ship-shape, big enough to carry a dozen men.
Robinson was astonished at Friday's skill in paddling
so large a canoe. She seemed to fly through the water,
and he could turn her with great ease.
"Will she do to go over in?" he asked, and Friday,
grinning, said, "Yes, even if big wind blow."
But Robinson did not mean to depend only on pad-
dling. He made Friday cut down a straight young
pine-tree for a mast, and amongst the old ship's sails
that he had kept so long he found at last two pieces that
were not rotten. From these he made what is called a
shoulder-of-mutton sail, and a small foresail. It took
him nearly two months to cut and fit them, but when
they were finished and hoisted they acted very well, and
when a clumsy rudder had been fixed to the boat, he
found that she steered nicely, and was quite safe and
stiff in a fresh breeze.
As the rainy season was nearly due, he made Friday
dig near the creek a kind of dock in the sand for the
new boat, just deep enough for her to float in; and when
the tide was low, they made a dam across the end of
the dock to keep the water out. Then they covered the
boat over very thickly with boughs of trees; and there
she lay, quite dry and snug, till the end of the wet
weather, when it was Robinson's plan to start for the
mainland.
A week or two before the dry season again came,
Robinson meant to open the dock and get the boat
afloat once more. And to be ready in plenty of time
he began to lay by a lot of food and other stores for
use on the voyage.
One morning, when he was very busy over his work,
he told Friday to go down to the beach to see if he could
find a turtle. Off went Friday, but before he had been
gone many minutes, back he came running in a great
hurry, crying out, "Master! Master! O sorrow! O bad!"
"What's the matter, Friday?" asked Robinson.
"Over yonder," said Friday, pointing to the west, and
very much scared; "over yonder, one, two, three canoe."
Robinson cheered him as well as he could.
"Well, Friday," said he, "we must fight them. Will
you fight?"
"Yes, Friday shoot," he answered, "but too much
great many come."
"No matter," said Robinson, "our guns will frighten
those we don't kill."
Friday promised to stand by him to the end, and to
do just as he was bid.
Then Robinson loaded two guns with large swan shot,
and gave them to Friday, and himself took four mus-
kets, which he loaded carefully with five small bullets
and two slugs each, and in each of his pistols he put two
bullets. Then he hung his cutlass by his side, and gave
Friday a hatchet.
When all was ready, he went up the hill with his tele-
scope, and saw that there were in all twenty-one sav-
ages, with three prisoners. They had landed not far
beyond the creek, near a spot where thick bushes grew
almost down to the sea.
Giving Friday one of the pistols to stick in his belt,
and one of the muskets to carry, they set off, each of
them now armed with a pistol and three guns, besides
Robinson's cutlass and Friday's hatchet. Robinson
put in his pocket a small bottle of rum, and gave Friday
a bag with more powder and bullets to carry, and told
him to keep very quiet, and to be sure not to fire till
Robinson gave the word.
To get at the savages without being seen, they had to
go nearly a mile out of their way, and being heavily
laden, they could not go very fast. During this walk,
Robinson began to argue with himself again, and to
think that perhaps after all it was no business of his
to go killing savages who had never done him any harm,
and who were only doing what they and their people
had done for hundreds of years. They knew no better,
he said to himself, and why should he kill them? His
mind was so filled with doubts, that he did not know
what to do. Finally, he decided that he would only go
near enough to see plainly what the savages were do-
ing, but that, unless there should be some special cause
for it, he would not attack them.
When he and Friday got near the place where the
savages had lit their fire, Robinson sent Friday for-
ward, to see what was going on, and to come back and
tell him.
Friday crept on, and returned very quickly, saying
that the cannials had already killed one of their prison-
ers, and were eating him, and that very soon they would
kill the second prisoner, who was lying near to them.
The second prisoner, Friday said, was a white man.
This news at once changed Robinson's plans, and he
had no longer any doubt what to do.
Creeping forward, he saw plainly through his glass
the white man lying bound hand and foot on the sand.
There was another tree, Robinson noticed, with a clump
of bushes round it, some distance nearer to the savages,
and within very easy shot of them. To that he and
Friday now crawled.
There was no time to lose, for when they reached the
tree, two of the savages had gone to the white man, and
were untying his ankles. The other cannibals were all
sitting close together.
Turning to Friday, Robinson said in a low voice,
"Now do exactly as I tell you." They both took aim
at the crowd of savages.
"Are you ready, Friday?" whispered Robinson.
'"Ready," said Friday.
"Then fire!"
Robinson's first shot killed one and wounded two,
but Friday's dropped two dead, and three wounded.
Snatching up fresh guns, both fired again before the
savages who were not hurt could get on their feet, for
they were so taken by surprise and frightened by the
noise, that the poor wretches hardly knew what was
happening. This time only two dropped, but many
more were wounded by the swan shot, and ran about
yelling till they fell from loss of blood.
"Now, Friday," said Robinson, taking up one of the
remaining loaded muskets, "follow me." And he
rushed out of the wood, with Friday close behind, and
charged down on the cannibals as fast as he could run.
The two men who had gone to kill the white prisoner
no sooner saw this than they fled to the canoes, and
three of the others followed, and jumped into the same
canoe.
Robinson bade Friday shoot at them, and Friday,
running forward, fired. All the men in the canoe fell,
two of them dead and one wounded. The others seemed
to fall from fear, for they soon jumped up and paddled
away with all their might.
Whilst Friday kept on firing, Robinson ran to the
white prisoner and cut his bonds, helping him on to his
feet, and giving him some rum from the bottle he had
brought. The man, on being asked what countryman
he was, answered that he was a Spaniard, and he began
to thank Robinson for what he had done. But Robin-
son, who could speak a little Spanish, stopped him,
saying, "Sefior, we will talk afterwards. At present we
must fight." And he gave the Spaniard the cutlass
from his belt and a pistol, telling him, if he had
strength left, to go and do what he could against the
savages.
As soon as the man got the weapons in his hands, he
ran with fury at the cannibals and cut two down, then
turned, and with equal fury attacked the rest.
Robinson now sent Friday for the muskets which had
been left under the tree, and began quickly to reload
them, giving Friday the musket which he himself had
been carrying, but which he had not fired.
Meantime the Spaniard had attacked a very big,
powerful savage who was armed with a club, and
though with his cutlass he had twice wounded the can-
nibal in the head, yet from being bound so long the
white man was weak, and now looked like getting the
worst of it. For the savage, making a rush, closed with
him and threw him, and in the struggle had nearly
wrenched the cutlass out of his hand, when the Spaniard
suddenly quitting his hold, drew his pistol and shot the
man through the body, killing him on the spot.
The other natives were now scattered in every direc-
tion, and Friday, running after them with his hatchet,
killed all of them except one who had been wounded by
the Spaniard, and who, in spite of his wounds, jumped
into the sea and swam out to the canoe in which were the
two others who had got away.
Friday advised Robinson to take another of the
canoes and go after them; and Robinson agreed, for he
thought that if any escaped they would be certain to
come back, bringing hundreds of others to avenge the
death of their friends. So the two ran to the beach and
began to shove off a canoe. But to their surprise, on
the bottom of the canoe lay another prisoner, an old
man, tied so hard, neck and heels, that even when his
bonds were cut he could not move. He groaned and
lay still, perhaps thinking that he was only being untied
to be killed.
Robinson handed the rum to Friday and told him to
pour some down the poor man's throat, which seemed
to revive him, for he sat up.
No sooner did Friday look at him and hear him speak,
than he began to dance and shout and laugh, and then
kneeling down, rubbed noses with the savage (which
is what these folks do instead of kissing each other),
and he was so excited that for some time he could not
explain what was the matter. As soon as he could
speak, he told Robinson that the man whom they had
found was his father. The poor creature's wrists and
ankles were chafed and stiff from being so long bound,
and he was parched with thirst.
Friday ran and fetched water for him, and then with
rum rubbed his father's wrists and ankles. Those of
the Spaniard also were so dreadfully cut and swollen,
and he was so worn out with fighting, that Friday had
to carry him on his back to the canoe. Then he pad-
dled the two men along to the creek, whilst Robinson
walked. But both men had to be carried up to the
castle, and Robinson was forced to rig up a tent for
them outside, because it was not possible for him and
Friday to lift them over the fence.
The next day Robinson sent Friday to bury the
bodies of the savages who had been killed, and to bring
in the muskets.
CHAPTER X
ARRIVAL OF AN ENGLISH SHIP; ROBINSON SAILS
FOR HOME
SOON after this Robinson had a long talk with the
Spaniard, who told him how he and his comrades
had been wrecked four years since, on that part of the
coast where Friday's tribe lived. He said that they
were well treated by the natives, but that they were put
to very great straits now for want of clothes, that their
powder was finished, and that they had lost all hope of
ever getting back to their country. He himself, he
said, had been captured in one of the many small wars
that are always taking place among the various tribes.
It struck Robinson that it might be possible for him
to get these men over to his island, provided that he
could be sure of their good faith, and that when they
came, they did not take the island from him by treachery.
It was a risk, he thought, but then, if he got so many
men, it would not be difficult to build a small ship that
could carry them all to England.
So he asked the Spaniard if he would promise, and
if he thought he could get his comrades to take an oath
that, if Robinson helped them, they would look on him
as their captain, and would swear to obey him in all
things. The Spaniard readily promised for himself,
and said that he was sure his comrades would keep faith.
It was arranged, therefore, that in about six months,
when the next harvest was reaped, and there would be
plenty of food for so many extra men, the Spaniard
and Friday's father should go over to the mainland in
one of the canoes which had been taken from the
savages.
Meantime, all hands set about the curing of very
large quantities of raisins, and much other work was
done to be in readiness for the coming of these men.
When the harvest was reaped, Robinson gave the
Spaniard and Friday's father each a musket and a
supply of powder and bullets, and loaded the canoe
with food, enough to last them and the others about a
fortnight, and the two men set off for the mainland
in fine weather, and with a fair wind.
It was about eight days after this, and when Robin-
son had begun to look out for their return, that one
morning very early, when Robinson was asleep, Friday
came running in, shouting "Master! master 1 They
come." Up jumped Robinson, and hurrying on his
clothes, ran out.
Looking towards the sea, he soon made out a sailing-
boat making for the shore, coming from the south end
of the island, but still some miles away. This was not
the direction from which the Spaniard and his com-
rades would come, nor were they likely to be in a sail-
ing-boat. So Robinson took his telescope, and went
to the top of the hill to see if he could make out who
were on board, before they landed.
Hardly had he got on to the hill when he noticed a
ship at anchor some distance from the shore. She
looked like an English vessel, he thought, and the boat
like an English long-boat.
This was a wonderful sight to Robinson, but yet he
was not easy in his mind. It was not a part of the
world where an English ship was likely to come, be-
cause in those days they were nearly all Spanish ves-
sels that traded in these seas, and the English and
Spaniards were bitter enemies. What could an Eng-
lish ship be doing here? There had been no storm to
drive her out of her course.
Robinson feared that if she was English there must
be something wrong about her. Perhaps, he thought,
she was a Pirate. So he was careful not to show him-
self or Friday.
Presently, as he watched, he saw the men in the boat
run her ashore and draw her up on the beach, about
half a mile from his castle. When they had landed,
56 The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe
Englishmen.
There were eleven men, but three of them had their
hands tied behind their backs, and were evidently pris-
oners. When the first four or five men had jumped
ashore, they brought out these three, all the while ill-
treating them, and behaving as if they meant to kill
their prisoners. Friday was sure that they meant to
eat them. <
Soon, without further harming the three men, the
others scattered about amongst the trees near the
shore, leaving the three sitting on the ground, very sad-
looking, but with their hands now untied.
At the time the boat was run aground, it was just
high-water, and the two sailors who had been left in
charge of her, and who had evidently been drinking too
much rum, went to sleep, and never noticed that the
tide was going out. When they awoke, the boat was
high and dry, and with all the strength of the whole
crew they could not move her, because the sand at that
part of the beach was very soft. This did not seem to
trouble any of them very much, for Robinson heard
one of the sailors shout, "Let her alone, Jack, can't ye?
She'll float next tide."
All forenoon Robinson watched, and when the hot-
test time of the day had come, he noticed the sailors
throw themselves down under the trees, and go to sleep,
some distance away from the three prisoners.
Then Robinson and Friday, taking their> muskets
and pistols, stole down cautiously behind the three men,
to try to speak to them without the others knowing.
Robinson had put on his goat-skin coat and the
great hairy hat that he had made for himself; and with
his cutlass and pistols in his belt, and a gun over each
shoulder, he looked very fierce.
The men did not see him till he spoke, and they were
so startled by his wild look, and by the sight of two
men armed to the teeth, that they nearly ran away.
The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe 57
Englishman, and a friend, and would help them if they
would show him how it could be done.
Then they explained to him what had happened. One
of the three was Captain of the ship that lay at anchor
off the island. Of the others, one was mate of the ship,
and the third man was a passenger. The crew had
mutinied, the Captain told Robinson, and had put him
and the other two in irons, and the ring-leaders in the
mutiny had proposed to kill them. Now they meant
to leave them on the island to perish.
The Captain was so astonished at finding anybody
there who proposed to help him, that he said in his
wonder: "Am I talking to a man, or to an angel from
heaven?"
"If the Lord had sent an angel, sir," said Robinson,
"he would probably have come better clothed."
Then he asked if the boat's crew had any firearms,
and was told that they had only two muskets, one of
which was left in the boat. "The rest should be easy,
then," Robinson said; "we can either kill them all, or
take them prisoners, as we please."
The Captain was unwilling to see the men killed, for
he said if two of the worst of them were got rid of, he
believed the rest would return to their duty.
Robinson made a bargain that if he saved the Cap-
tain from the mutineers, and recovered the ship, he
and Friday were to be taken home to England in her,
free of cost; and to this the Captain and the others
agreed.
Then Robinson gave each of them a musket, with
powder and ball, after which the Captain and the mate
and the passenger marched towards the spot where the
mutinous sailors lay asleep. One of the men heard
them advance, and turning round, saw them, and cried
out to his companions. But it was too late, the mate
and the passenger fired, and one of the ring-leaders fell
dead. A second man also fell, hut jumped up imme-
diately and called to the others to help him. But the
Captain knocked him down with the butt of his musket,
and the rest of the men, seeing Robinson and Friday
coming, and knowing that they had no chance'against
five armed men, begged for mercy. Three others who
had been straying about among the trees came back on
hearing the shots, and were also taken, and thus the
whole crew of the boat was captured.
The Captain and Robinson now began to think how
they might recover the ship. There were on board, the
Captain said, several men on whom he thought he could
depend, and who had been forced by the others into the
mutiny against their wills. But it would be no easy
thing to retake the ship, for there were still twenty-six
men on board, and as they were guilty of mutiny, all of
them, if taken back to England, would most likely be
hanged. Thus they were certain to make a fight for it.
The first thing that Robinson and the others now did
was to take everything out of the boat,—oars, and
mast, and sail, and rudder; then they knocked a hole
in her bottom, so that she could not float. Whilst they
were doing this, and drawing her still further up on
the beach, they heard first one gun and then another
fired by the ship as signals to the boat to return.
As she of course did not move, Robinson saw through
his glass another boat with ten men on board, armed
with muskets, leave the ship, coming to bring the others
back.
This was serious enough, for now Robinson and his
party had to make plans whereby they might capture
also this fresh boat's crew.
Accordingly, they tied the hands of all the men they
had first taken, and sent the worst of them to the cave
under the charge of Friday and of one of the men that
the Captain said was to be trusted, with orders to shoot
any who tried to give an alarm or to escape.
Then Robinson took his party and the rest of the pris-
oners into the castle, where, from the rock, they
watched for the landing of the second boat.
The Captain and mate were very nervous, and de-
spaired of taking this fresh body of men, but Robinson
was quite confident of success, and put heart into them
by his cheerfulness.
Of the prisoners in his castle, there were two whom
the Captain believed to be honest men, and on their
promising solemnly to keep faith, and to fight for him,
Robinson released them.
The crew of the second boat, when they landed, were
terribly surprised to find the first boat empty and stove
in, and they were seen anxiously consulting what to do.
Then they hallooed and fired volleys. Getting no
reply, they were evidently alarmed, for they all jumped
into their boat and began to pull off to the ship. In a
few minutes, however, they seemed to change their
minds, for again they landed, this time leaving three
men in charge of the boat, and keeping her in the water.
The other seven came ashore, and started in a body
across the island to look for their lost comrades. But
they did not care to go far, and soon stopped, again
firing volleys and hallooing. Getting again no reply,
they began to march back to the sea. Whereupon
Robinson ordered Friday and the mate to go over the
creek to the west and halloo loudly, and wait till the
sailors answered. Then Friday and the mate were to
go further away and again halloo, thus gradually get-
ting the men to follow them away from the shore.
This plan succeeded very well, for when the sailors,
thinking they heard their missing friends hail, ran to
find them, their way was stopped by the creek, over
which they had to get the boat to carry them. They
took with them, then, one of the three men whom they
had left in the boat, and ordered the others to moor the
boat to a tree, and remain there.
This was just what Robinson wanted. And, more-
over, one of the men played still further into his hands,
for he left the boat and lay down under a tree to sleep.
On him the Captain rushed, and knocked him down as
he tried to rise to his feet, whereupon the sailor left in
the boat yielded, the more readily that he had joined
the mutineers very unwillingly, and was now glad
of the chance to rejoin his Captain.
Meantime Friday and the mate, by hallooing and
answering, drew the rest of the boat's crew from hill to
hill through the woods, till at last they had got them so
far astray that it was not possible for them to
find their way back before dark. When they did get
back to where the boat had been left, and found the men
whom they had left in her gone, they were in a terrible
fright.
It was not difficult for Robinson and his men to sur-
round them, and it chanced that the boatswain of the
ship, who was the greatest villain of the lot, and the
chief cause of all the trouble, walked in the darkness
close to the Captain, who jumped up and shot him
dead. The others then surrendered, believing what they
were told, that they were surrounded by fifty armed
men. All begged hard for their lives, and a few whom
the Captain said he could trust were set at liberty on
promising to help to retake the ship. The others were
bound and put in the cave.
Robinson and Friday remained on shore to look after
the prisoners, whilst the Captain and the mate and the
passenger, with those of the crew who were trustworthy,
having patched up the damaged boat, pulled off in
her and in the other to the ship, which they reached
about midnight. When they were a short distance off,
the Captain made one of the crew hail the ship and say
that they had brought off the boat and the men they
had gone in search of. Then both boats ran alongside
at once, one on each side of the vessel, and before the
mutineers knew what was happening they were over-
powered, one or two of them being killed. Only one
of the Captain's party was hurt, the mate, whose arm
was broken by a musket-ball.
As soon as the ship was secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fired, that being the signal he had
agreed to make to let Robinson know if he succeeded in
taking the ship.
Robinson's stay in the island had now come to an
end, after more than twenty-eight years, for in a few
days he and Friday sailed for England in the ship.
Some of the mutineers were left on the island, and
were afterwards joined by the Spaniard and his com-
rades, for whom Robinson left a letter.
Robinson did not forget, when he left, to take with
him the money and gold bars he had got from the wreck
of the Spanish ship, and he took also, as a memento,
the goatskin coat and the great hairy hat. But the
Captain was able before the ship sailed to give him
proper clothing, the wearing of which at first put him to
dreadful discomfort.
The voyage was a long one, but they sighted the
English coast at last.
It was thirty-five years since Robinson had set foot
in England. And that morning, when at last, after
the weary years of exile, he again saw his native land,
he laid his head down on his arms and cried like a
ehild.
And, may be, you too some day may know the joy
of coming home, out of the land of bondage.
