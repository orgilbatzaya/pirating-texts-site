O F
'ROBINSON CRUSOE.
THAT homely proverb used on so many occasions
in England, viz. "That what is bred in the
bone, will not go out of the flesh," was never more ve-
rified than in the story of my life. Any one would
think, that after thirty-five years affliction, and a variety
of unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any,
ever went through before, and after near seven years
of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things,
grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me
to have had experience of every state of middle life, and
to know which was most adapted to make a man com-
pletely happy; I say, after all this, any one would
have thought that the native propensity to rambling,
which I gave an account of in my first setting out in
the world to have been so predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be fully evacua-
ted, or at least condensed ; and I might, at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at home,
and have done venturing life and fortune any more.

2 ADVENTURES OF
Nay sarther, the common motive of foreign adven-
tures was taken away in me, for I had no fortune to
make; I had nothing to seek: if I had gained ten
thousand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had al-
ready sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it
to; and that I had was visibly increasing; for having
no great family, I could not spend the income of what
I had, unless I would set up for an expensive way of liv-
ing, such as a great family, servants, equipage, gaiety,
and the like, which were things I had no notion of, or
inclination to; so that I had nothing indeed to do but
to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it
increase daily upon my hands. Yet all these things
had no effect upon me, or at least not enough to re-
fist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again,
which hung about me like a chronical distemper; par-
ticularly the desire of seeing my new plantation in the
island, and the colony I left there, run in my head
continually. I dreamed of it all night, and my ima-
gination ran upon it all day; it was uppermost in all
my thoughts; and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in
short, nothing could remove it out of my mind: it
even broke so violently into all my discourses, that it
made my conversation tiresome, for I could talk of no-
thing else; all my discourse ran into it, even to imperti-
nence, and I saw it in myself. I have often heard persons of good judgment say,
that all the stir people make in the world about ghosts
and apparitions, is owing to the strength of imagination,
and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds;
that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing, or a
ghost walking, and the like: that people's poring af-

s
fectionately upon the past conversation of their deceas-
ed friends, so realises it to them, that they are capable of
fancying, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that
they see them, talk to them, and are answered by them,
when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour
in the thing, and they really know nothing of the matter. For my part, I know not to this hour whether
there are any such things as real apparitions, spectres,
or walking of people after they are dead, or whether
there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that kind,
more than the product of vapours, sick minds, and
wandering sancies; but this I know, that my imagi-
nation worked up to such a height, and brought me in-
to such excess of vapours, or what else I may call it,
that I actually supposed myself often upon the spot, at
my old castle, behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard,
Friday's father, and the reprobate sailors I left upon the
island; nay, I fancied I talked with them, and looked at
-them so steadily, though I was broad awake, as at per-
sons just before me; and this I did till I often frighten-
ed myself with the images my fancy represented to me.
'Onetime, in my sleep, I had the villainy of the three pi-
rate sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and Friday's sather, that it was surprizing; they told
me how they barbarously attempted to murder all the
Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provisions they
had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve them; things
that I had never heard of, and that indeed were never
all of them true in sact : but it was so warm in my ima-
gination, and so realised to me, that, to the hour I saw
them, I could not be persuaded but that it was, or
would be true; also how I resented it, when the Spa-
niard complained to me, and how I brought them to B 2 justice,
justice, tried them before me, and ordered them all
three to be hanged. What there was really in this, shall
be seen in its place: for however I came to form such
things in my dream, and what secret converse of spi-
rits injected it, yet there was, I say, much of it true.
I own, that this dream had nothing in it literally and
specifically true; but the general part was so true, the
base, villainous behaviour of these three hardened rogues
was such, and had been so much worse than all I can
describe, that the dream had too much similitude of
the sact; and as I would afterwards have punished them
severely, so, if I had hanged them all, I had been much
in the right, and even should have been justified both
by the laws of God and man. But, to return to my
story: in this kind of temper I lived some years; I had
no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no agree-
able diversion, but what had something or other of this
in it ; so that my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one night, that she be-
lieved there wassome secret powerful impulse of Provi-
dence upon me, which had determined me to go thither
again; and that she found nothing hindered my going,
but my being engaged to a wife and children. She told
me, that it was true she could not think of parting with
me; but as she was assured, that if she was dead it
would be the first thing I would do; so, as it seemed
to her that the thing was determined above, she would
not be the only obstruction; for, if I thought fit, and resolved to go Here she found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very earnestly at her, so
that it a little disordered her, and she stopped. Tasked
her why she did not go on, and say out what she was
going to say? But I perceived that her heart was too.
5
full, and some tears stood in her eyes. Speak out, my
dear, said I; are you willing I should go? No, says
she, very affectionately, I am far from willing; but if
you are resolved to go, says she, and rather than I
would be the onjy hindrance, I will go with you: for
though I think it a most preposterous thing for one of
your years, and in your condition, yet, if it must be,
said she, again weeping, I won't leave you; for, if it be
of Heaven, you must do it; there is no resisting it:
and if Heaven make it your duty to go, he will also
make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of
me, that I may not obstruct it?
This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to consider
what I was doings; I corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately, what business
I had, after threescore years, and after such a life of
tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so happy
and easy a manner; I say, what business had I to rush
into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures fit
only for youth and poverty to run into?With those thoughts I considered my new engage-
ment; that I had a wife, one child born, and my wife
then great with child of another; that I had all the
world could give me, and had no need to seek hazard for gain; that I was declining in years, and ought to
think rather of leaving what I had gained, than of
seeking to increase it; that as to what my wife had
said of its being an impulse from Heaven, and that
it should be my duty to go, I had no notion of that:
so, after many of these cogitations, I struggled with the
power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it,
as I believe people may always do in like cases if they
B 3 will:
will: and, in a word, I conquered it; composed myself
with such arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and
which my present condition furnished me plentifully
with; and particularly, as the most effectual method, I
resolved to divert myself with other things, and to
engage in some business that might effectually tie
me up from any more excursions of this kind; for I
found that thing return upon me chiefly when I was
idle, and had nothing to do, nor any thing of moment
immediately before me. To this purpose I bought a
little farm in the county of Bedford, and resolved to
remove myself thither. I had a little convenient house
upon it; and the land about it, I found, was capable of
great improvement, and that it was many ways suited to my inclination, which delighted in cultivating,
managing, planting, and improving of land; and par-
ticularly, being an inland country, I was removed from
conversing among sailors, and things relating to the
remote parts of the world. In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting seriously to work,
became, in one half year, a mere country gentleman: my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my
servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting,'
&c. and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life
that nature was capable of directing, or that a man al-
ways bred to misfortunes was capable of retreating to. I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay,
was limited by no articles; I could pull up or cut down
as I pleased: what I planted, was.for myself, and what
I improved, was for my family; and having thus left
off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least dis-
comfort 7
comfort in any part of life as to this world. Now I
thought indeed that I enjoyed the middle state of life
which my father so earnestly recommended to me, and
lived a kind of heavenly life, something like what is de-
scribed by the poet, upon the subject of a country life.
"— Free from vices, free from care,
"Age has no pain, and youth no snare."
But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from
unseen Providence unhinged me at once; and not
only made a breach upon me inevitable and incurable,
but drove me, by its consequences, into a deep relapse of
the wandering disposition, which, as I may say, being
born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold of me, ,
andlike the returns of a violent distemper, came on with
an irresistible force upon me, so that nothing could
make any more impression upon me. This blow was
the loss of my wife. It is not my business here to
write an elegy upon my wife, give a character of her
particular virtues, and make my court to the sex by the
flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words,
the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my enterpri-
zes, the engine, that by her prudence, reduced me to that
happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant
and ruinous project that fluttered in my head, as above,
and did more to guide my rambling genius than a
mother's tears, a father's instructions, a friend's coun-
sel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. I was
happy in listening to her tears, and in being moved by
her entreaties; and to the last degree desolate and dis-
located in the world by the loss of her. When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me; \ was as much a stranger in it, in my
B 4 thoughts,
8
ADVENTURES OF
thoughts, as I was in the Brazils, when I first went on
shore there; and as much alone, except as to the assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I knew neither
what to think nor what to do. I saw the world busy
round me, one part labouring for bread, another part
squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures, equally
miserable, because the end they proposed still fled from
them; for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of
their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and repen-
tance; and the men of labour spent their strength in
daily struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength
they laboured with: so living in a daily circulation of
sorrow, living but to work, and working but to live,
as if daily bread were the only end of wearisome life,
and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread. This put me in mind of the life I lived in my king-
dom, the island; where I suffered no more corn to grow,
because I did not want it; and bred no more goats,
because I had no more use for them : where the money
lay in the drawer till it grew mouldy, and had scarce
the favour to be looked upon in twenty years. All these things, had I improved them as I ought to
have done, and as reason and religion had dictated to
me, would have taught me to search farther than human
enjoyments for a full felicity; and that there was some-
thing which certainly was the reason andend of life,
superior to all these things, and which was either to be
possessed, or at least hoped for, on this side the grave. But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run afore the wind:
my thoughts ran all away again into the old affair; my
head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign
adventures; and all the pleasant, innocent amusements
of my farm, my garden, my cattle, and my family, which
9
which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to
me, had no relish, and were like music to one that
has-no ear, or food to one that has no taste: in a word,
I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and
return to London; and in a few months after, I did so. When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I
was before y I had no relish for the place, no employ-
ment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like an
idle person, of whom it may be said he is perfectly
useless in God's creation, and it is not one farthing's matter to the rest of his kind whether he be dead or
alive. This also was the thing, which of all circum-
stances of life, was the most my aversion, who had been
all my days used to an active life; and I would often
say to myself, "a state of idleness is the very dregs of
life: and indeed I thought I was much more suitably
employed when I was twenty-six days making me a
deal board. It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when
my nephew, who, as I have observed before, I had
brought up to the sea, and had made him commander
of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had made; he came to me,
and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance
had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to
the East Indies and to China, as private traders:—
"And now uncle," says he, " if you will go to sea with
me, I will engage-to land you upon your old habita-
'*tion in the island; for we are to touch atthe*Brasi!s."
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of
things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved,
and not communicated to any in the world,
My
My nephew knew nothing how sar ray distemper of
wandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing
of what he had in his thought to say, when that very
morning, before he came to me, I had, in a great deal of
confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my
circumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, viz.
That I would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old
sea-captain; and so, if it was rational and practicable,
I would go and see the island again, and see what was
become of my people there. I had pleased myself with
the thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inhabi-
tants from hence, getting a patent for the possession,
and I knew not what; when, in the middle of all this,
in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his project
of carrying me thither in his way to the East-Indies. I paused awhile at his words; and looking steadily
at him, "what devil," said I, "sent you on this unlucky
errand \" My nephew stared, as if he had been frightened, at first; but perceiving that I was not much displeased
with the proposal, he recovered himself: "I hope it
may not be an unlucky proposal, Sir," says he; "I
"dare say you would be pleased to see your new colony
there, where you once reigned with more felicity
than most of your brother monarchs in the world."
In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper,
that is to say, the prepossession I was under, and of
which I have said so much, that I told him, in few
words, if he agreed with the merchants, I would go with
him: but I told him I would not promise to go any
sartherthan myown island. "Why, Sir," says he, "you don't want to be left there again, I hope?" "Why,"
said I, "can you not take me up again on your
return?" He told me it would not be possible to do so;
that the merchants would never allow him to come that way

ROBINSON CRUSOE. **way with a laden ship of such value, it being a month's'
fail out of his way, and might be three or four: "Be-*
** sides, Sir, if I should miscarry," said he," and not
return at all, then you would be just reduced to the
condition you were in before."
This was very rational; but we both found out a
remedy for it; which was, to carry a framed sloop on
board the ship, which being taken in pieces, and ship-
ped on board the ship, might, by the help of some car-
penters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up
again in the island, and finished, fit to go to sea, in a
sew days, I was not long resolving; for indeed the importuni-
ties of my nephew joined so effectually with my in-
clination, that nothing could oppose me : on the other
hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody concerned
themselves so much for me as to persuade me to one way
or the other, except my ancient good friend the wi-
dow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my
years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of
a long voyage; and, above all, my young children: but
it was all to no purpose ;—I had an irresistible desire to
the voyage; and I told her, I thought there was some-
thing so uncommon in the impressions I had upon
my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of
resisting Providence if I should attempt to stay at
home: after which she ceased her expostulations, and
joined with me, not only in making provision for my
voyage, but also in settling my samily affairs for my
absence, and providing for the education of my chil-
dren. In order to this, I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and sa-
tisfied tisficd they would have justice done them, whatever
gnight besall me; and for their education, I left it
wholly to the widow, with a sufficient maintenance to
herself for her care: all which she richly deserved, for
no mother could have taken more care in their educa-
tion, or understood it better; and as she lived till I
came home, I also lived to thank her for it. My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of
January 1694-5; and I, with my man Friday, went on
board in the Downs the 8th ; having, besides that sloop
which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of
all kinds of necessary things for my colony; which, if I
did not find in good condition, I resolved to leave so. First, I carried with me some servants, whom I
purposed to place there as inhabitants, or at least
to set on work there, upon my account, while I stayed,
and either to leave them there, or carry them forward,
as they would appear willing ; particularly, I carried two
carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow,
who was a cooper by trade, and was also a general mecha-
nic; for he was dexterous at making wheels, and hand-
mills to grind corn, was a good turner, and a good
pot-maker; he also made any thing that was proper to
make of earth, or of wood; in a word, we called him
our Jack of all trades. With these I carried a tailor, who had offered himself to go a passenger to the East
Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented to
stay on our new plantation; and proved a most necessary,
handy fellow, as could be desired, in many other busi-
nesses besides that of his trade: for, as I observed for-
merly, " Necessity arms us for all employments. My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not
kept account of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity
.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13quantity of linen, and some English thin stuffs, for
clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find there; and enough of them, as, by my calculation, might com-
fortably supply them for seven years: if I remember
right, the materials I carried for clothing them, with
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they
could want for wearing, amounted to above two hundred
pounds, including some beds, bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen-utensils, with pots, kettles,
pewter, brass, &c. and near a hundred pounds more in
iron-work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks,
hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of. I carried also a hundred spare-arms, muskets, and
fusees; besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two pieces
of brass cannon; and because I knew not what time and
what extremities I was providing for, I carried a hun-
dred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the
iron part of some pikes and halberts; so that, in short,
we had a large magazine of all sorts of stores: and I
made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns
more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind if
there was occasion; that, when we came there, we might
build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies:
and indeed, I at first thought there would be need
enough for all, and much more, if we hoped to main-
tain our possession of the island; as shall be seen in the
course of that story. I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been
used to meet with; and therefore shall have the less oc-
casion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps may be
impatient to hear how matters went with my colony: yet some odd accidents, crosswinds, and bad weather 5 happened,
14
ADVENTURES OF
happened, on this first setting out, which made the voy-
age longer than I expected it at first: and I, who had
never made but one voyage, viz. my first voyage to
Guinea, in which I might be said to come back again as the voyage was at first designed, began to think the
same ill fate attended me; and that I was born to be ne-
ver contented with being on shore, and yet to be al-
ways unfortunate at sea. Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and
we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where
we lay wind-bound two and twenty days : but we had
this satisfaction with the disaster, that provisions were
here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that
while we lay here, we never touched the ship's stores,
but rather added to them. Here, also, I took in several
live hogs, and two cows, with their calves; which I resol-
ved, if I had a good passage, to put on shore in my island;
but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them.
We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and
had a very fair gale of wind for some days: as I remem-
ber, it might be about the 20th of February, in the
evening late, when the mate, having the watch, came
into the round-house, and told us he saw flash of fire,
and heard a gun fired; and while he was telling us of it,
a boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard ano-
ther. This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck,
where, for a while, we heard nothing; but in a few mi-
nutes we saw a very great light, and found that there
was some very terrible fire at a distance: immediately
we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all
agreed, that there could be no land that way in which
the fire showed itself, no, not for 500 leagues, for it ap-
peared at W. N. W. Upon this we concluded it must
be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our hearing the noise
noise of guns just before, we concluded that it could
not be far off, we stood directly towards it, and were
presently satisfied we should discover it; because the
farther we sailed, the greater the light appeared; though, the weather being hazy, we could not perceive any thing
but the light for a while. In about half an hour's sailing,
the wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and
the weather clearing up a little, we could plainly discern
that it was a great ship on fire in the middle of the sea. I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though
not at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it;
1 presently recollected my former circumstances, and
in what condition I was in, when taken up by the Por-
tuguese captain; and how much more deplorable the
circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to that
ship must be, if they had no other ship in company
with them. Upon this, I immediately ordered that five
guns should be fired, one soon after another; that, if
possible, we might give notice to them that there was
help for them at hand, and that they might endeavour
to save themselves in their boat; for though we could
see the flames of the ship, yet they, it being night,
could see nothing of us. We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the
burning ship drove, waiting for day-light; when, on a
sudden, to our great terror, though we had reason to
expect it, the ship blew up in the air; and immediately,
that is to say, in a few minutes, all the fire was out,
that is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. This was a
terrible and indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake
of the poor men; who, I concluded, must be either all
destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost distress in
their boat, in the middle of the ocean; which, at pre-
sent, ADVENTURES OF
sent, by reason it was dark, I could not fee: however,
to direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to be
hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could,
and which we had lanthorns for, and kept firing guns
all the night long; letting them know, by this, that
there was a ship not far off. About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered
the ship's boats by the help of our perspectiveglasses;
found there were two of them, both thronged with peo«
pie, and deep in the water. We perceived they rowed,
the wind being against them; that they saw our ship,
and did their utmost to make us see them. We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know
we saw them, and hung a waft out, as a signal for them
to come on board, and then made more sail, standing
directly to them. In little more than half an hour, we
came up with them; and, in a word, took them all in,
being no less than sixty-four men, women, and chil-
dren; for there were a great many passengers. Upon the whole,we found it wasa French mer-
chant-ship of 300 tons, homeward-bound from Quebec,
in the river of Canada. The master gave us a long
account of the distress of his ship; how the fire began
in the steerage, by the negligence of the steersman, but
on his crying out for help, was, as every body thought,
entirely put out; but they soon found that some sparks
of the first fire had gotten into some part of the ship, so
difficult to come at, that they could not effectually
quench it; and afterwards getting in between the tim-
bers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded
into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all the
application they were able to exert. They

They had no more to do then, but to get into their
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty large; being their long-boat, and a great shallop, besides a
small skiff, which was of no great service to them, other
than to get some fresh water and provisions into her,
after they had secured their lives from the fire. They
had indeed small hope of their lives by getting into
these boats, at that distance from any land; only, as
they said well, that they were escaped from the fire, and
a possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea,
and might take them in. They had sails, oars, and a
compass; and were preparing to make the best of their
way back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing pretty
fair, for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E. They had
as much provision and water, as, with sparing it so as
to be next door to starving, might support them about
twelve days; in which, if they had no bad weather,
and no contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he
might get to the Banks of Newfoundland, and might
perhaps take some fish, to sustain them till they might
go on shore. But there were so many chances against
them in all these cases, such as storms, to overset and
founder them; rains and cold, to benumb and perish
their limbs; contrary winds, to keep them out and
starve them; that it must have been next to miraculous
if they had escaped. In the midst of their consternation, every one
being hopeless and ready to despair, the captain, with
tears in his eyes, told me they were on a sudden sur-
prised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after
that four more; these were the five guns which I cau-
sed to be fired at first seeing the light. This revived
their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above, Vol. II. C I desired
ADVENTURES OF
I desired it should, viz. that there was a ship at hand
for their help. It was upon the hearing of these guns,
that they took down their masts and sails: the sound coming from the windward, they resolved to lie by till
morning. Some time after this, hearing no more guns,
they fired three muskets, one a considerable while af-
ter another; but these, the wind being contrary, we
never heard. Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and hearing
the guns which, as I have said, I caused to be fired all
the rest of the night: this set them to work with their
oars, to keep their boats ahead, at least, that we might
the sooner come up with them; and, at last, to their in-
expressible joy, they found we saw them. It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these
poor delivered people ran into, to express the joy of
their souls at so unexpected a deliverance. Grief and
fear are easily described; sighs, tears, groans, and a
very few motions of the head and hands, make up the
sum of its variety; butan excess ofjoy, afurprize of joy,
has a thousand extravagancies in it: there were some in
tears, some raging and tearing themselves, as if they
had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark
raving, and downright lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their feet, others wringing their hands;
some were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more
crying; many quite dumb, not able to speak a word;
others sick and vomiting; several swooning, and ready
to faint; and a few were crossing themselves, and giving
God thanks. I would t Would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterwards, but the passion
was too strong for them at first, and they were not able
to master it: they were thrown into ecstasies, and a kind
of frenzy, and it was but a very few that were com-
posed and serious in theit joy.
Perhaps also the case may havesome addition to itfrom
the particular circumstance of that nation they belong-
ed to; I mean the French, whose temper is allowed to
be more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly,
and their spirits more fluid, than in other nations. I
am not philosopher enough to determine the cause; but
nothing I had ever seen before came up to it. The ec-
stasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he
found his father in the boat, came the nearest to it; and
the surprise of the master and his two companions,
whom I delivered from the villains that set them on
shore in the island, came a little way towards it; but
nothing was to compare to this, either that I saw in
Friday, or any where else in my life. It is further observable, that these extravagances did
not shew themselves in that different manner I have
mentioned, in different persons only; but all the vari-
ety would appear, in a short succession of moments, in
one and the same person. A man that we saw this mi-
nute dumb, and as it were stupid and confounded, would the next minute be dancing and hollowing like an antic;
and the next moment be tearing his hair or pulling his
cloaths to pieces, and stamping them under his feet, like
madman in a few moments after that, we would have
him all in tears, then sick, swooning, and had not
immediate help been had, would in a sew moments
have been dead; and thus it was not with one or two,
G a or
or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of them r
and, if I remember right, our surgeon was obliged to
let above thirty of them blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old man,
and the other a young man ; and that which was strangest
was, the oldest man was the worst. As soon as he let his
foot on board our ship, and saw himself safe, he dropt
down stone dead, to all appearance, not the least sign of
life could be perceived in him; our surgeon immediately
applied proper remedies to recover him, and was the
only man in the ship that believed he was not dead; at
length he opened a vein in his arm, having first chaffed
and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as possible:
upon this the blood, which only dropped at first, flow-
ing freely, in three minutes after the man opened his
eyes, and a quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew
better, and in a little time, quite well: after the blood
was stopped he walked about, told us he was perfectly
well; took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave
him, and was what we called come to himself: about a
quarter of an hour after this, they came running into the
cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman
that had sainted, and told him the priest was gone stark
mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change of
his circumstances in his mind, and again this put him
into an ecstasy of joy, his spirits whirled about faster
than the vessels could convey them, the blood grew
hot and feverish, and the man was as sit for Bedlam as
any creature that ever was in it: the surgeon would
not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him
something to dose and put him to sleep, which after
some time operated upon him, and he waked next
morning perfectly composed and well.
The
The younger priest behaved with great command
of his passions, and was really an example of a serious,
well-governed mind; at his first coming on board the
ship, he threw himself flat on his sace, prostrating him-
self in thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I un-
happily and unseasonably disturbed him, really think-
ing he had been in a swoon; but he spoke calmly,
thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks for
his deliverance, begged me to leave him a few mo-
ments, and that, next to his Maker, he would give me
thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him
also: he continued in that posture about three minutes,
or little more, after I left him, then came to me, as he
had said he would, and with a great deal of seriousness
and affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me,
that had, under God, given him and so many miserable
creatures their lives: I told him, I had no room to
move'him to thank God for it, rather than me, for J
had seen that he had done that already; but I added,
that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dic-
tated to all men, and that we had as much reason as he
to give thanks to God, who had blessed us so sar as
to make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of
his creatures.
After this, the young priest applied himself to his
country-folks; laboured to compose them; persuaded,
entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his
utmost to keep them within the exercise of their reason;
and with some he had success, though others were for
a time out of all government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to writing, as per-
haps it may be useful to those into whose hands it may C 3 sall,
sail, for the guiding themselves in all the extravagancies
of their passions; for if an excess of joy can carry men
out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason,
what will not the extravagancies of anger, rage, and a
provoked mind carry us to ? And indeed here I saw rea-
son for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions
of every kind, as well those of joy and satissaction, as
those of sorrow and anger.
We were something disordered by these extravagan-
cies among our new guests for the first day, but when
they had been retired, lodgings provided for them as
well as our ship would allow, and they had slept hear-
tily, as most of them did, being satigued and frightened,
they were quite another fort of people the next day.
Nothing of good manners or civil acknowledgements
for the kindness shewn them was wanting; the French,
it is known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that
way. The captain and one of the priests came to me
the next day, and desired to speak with me and my
nephew : the commander began to consult with us what
mould be done with them; and first they told us, that
as we had saved their lives, so all they had was little
enough for a return to us for that kindness received.
The captain said they had saved some money, and some
things of value in their boats, catched hastily out of
the flames, and if we would accept it, they were order-,
ed to make an offer of it all to us; they only desired to
be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, If possible,
they might get a passage to France. My nephew was
for accepting their money at first word, and to consider
what to do with them afterwards; but I overruled him
in that part, for I knew what it was to be set on shore
in a strange country: and if the Portuguese captain that took
took me up at sea had served me so, and took all I had
for my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been
as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at Barbary,
the mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted: and per-
haps a Portuguese is not a much better master than a
Turk, if not, in some cases, much worse. I therefore told the French captain that we had taken
them up in their distress, it was true, but that it was
our duty to do so, as we were fellow creatures; and we
would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like, or
any other extremity; that we had done nothing for
them but what we believed they would have done for
us, if we had been in their case, and they in ours; but
that we took them up to save them, not to plunder them;
and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that lit-
tle from them which they had saved out of the fire, and
then set them on shore and leave them; that this would
be first to save them from death, and then kill them our-
selves; save them from drowning, and abandon them to
starving; and therefore I would not let the least thing
be taken from them: as to setting them on shore, I told
them indeed that was an exceeding difficulty to us ; for
that the ship was bound to the East Indies; and though
we were driven out of our course to the westward a very
great way, and perhaps were directed by Heaven on
purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible for
us wilfully to change our voyage on their particular ac-
count; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to
the freighters, with whom he was under charter-party
to pursue his voyage by the way of Brasil; and all I
knew we could do for them, was to put ourselves in the
way of meeting with other ships homeward-bound from C 4 the
ADVENTURES OF
the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, to
England or France. The first part of the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but
they werein avery great consternation, especially the
passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the
East Indies: they then entreated me, that seeing I
was driven so far to the westward before I met with
them, I would at least keep on the same course to the
Banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might
meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to
carry them back to Canada, from whence they came. I thought this was but a reasonable request on their
part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed
I considered, that to carry this whole company to the
East Indies, would not only be an intolerable severity
upon the poor people, but would be ruining our whole
voyage, by devouring all our provisions; so I thought it
no breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen ac-
cident made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no
one could say we were to blame; for the laws of God
and nature would have forbid that we should refuse to
take up two boats full of people in such a distressed con-
dition; and the nature of the thing, as well respecting
ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set them on
shore somewhere or other for their deliverance; so I
consented that we would carry them to Newfoundland,
if wind and weather would permit; and if not, that I
would carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies. The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather
pretty good; and as the winds had continued in the
points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed
several opportunities of sending them to France; for
we
we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two
were French, from St. Christopher's; but they had been
so long beating up against the wind, that they durst take
in no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for the
voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should
take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a
week after this that we made the Banks of Newfound-
land; where, to shorten my story, we put all our French
people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there,
to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to
France, if they could get provisions to victual them-
selves with. When I say, all the French went on
shore, I should remember that the young priest I spoke
of, hearing we were bound to the East Indies, desired
to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the
Coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed to, for I
wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason,
as will appear afterwards; also four of the seamen enter-
ed themselves on our ship, and proved very useful fel-
lows. From hence we directed our course for the West In-
dies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about twenty
days together, sometimes little or no wind at all; when
we met with another subject for our humanity to work
upon, almost as deplorable as that before. It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north,
on the 19th day of March 1694-5, when we spied asail, our course S. E. and by S.: we soon perceived it
was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could
not at first know what to make of her, till after coming
a little nearer, we found she had lost her main top-mast,
fore-mast and bowsprit; and presently she fired a gun, as
a signal of distress: the weather was pretty good, wind at
at N. N. W. a fresh gale, and we soon came to speak
with her. We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at Bar-
badoes, a few days before she was ready to sail, by a ter-
rible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were
both gone on shore; so that, besides the terror of the
storm, they were in an indifferent case for good artists
to bring the ship home. They had been already nine
weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, which had blown them
quite out of their knowledge to the westward, and in
which they lost their masts, as above: they told us they
expected to have seen the Bahama islands, but were then
driven away again to the south-east, by a strong gale of
wind at N. N. W. the same that blew now, and having
no sails to work the ship with but a main-course, and a
kind of square-sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had
set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were en-
deavouring to stand away for the Canaries. But that which was worst of all was, that they were
almost starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had undergone: theirbread and flesh was
quite gone; they had not one ounce left in the ship,
and had none for eleven days; the only relief they had
was, their water was not all spent, and they had about
half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough: some
succades, or sweet-meats they had at first, but they were
devoured; and they had seven casks of rum. There were a youth and his mother, and a maid ser-
vant on board, who were going passengers, and thinking
the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the
evening before the hurricane began; and having no pro-
visions visions of their own left, they were in a more deplora-
ble condition than the rest: for the seamen being redu-
ced to such an extreme necessity themselves, had no com-
passion (we may be sure, for the poor passengers; and
they were indeed in a condition, that their misery is very
hard to describe. I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity
had not led me (the weather being fair, and the wind
abated) to go on board the ship. The second mate, who, upon this occasion, commanded the ship, had been on
board our ship, and he told me, indeed, they had three
passengers in the great cabin, that were in a deplo-
rable condition; nay, says he, I believe they are dead,
for I have heard nothing of them for above two days;
and I was afraid to inquire after them, said he, for I
had nothing to relieve them with. We immediately applied ourselves to give them
what relief we could spare; and indeed I had so far over-
ruled things with my nephew, that I would have vic-
tualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia, or
any other part of the coast of America, to have supplied
ourselves; but there was no necessity for that. But now they were in a new danger; for they were
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave
them: the mate or commander brought six men with
him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked like
skeletons, and were so weak, that they could hardly sit
to their oars: the mate himself was very ill, and half
starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing from
the men, and went share and share alike with them in
every bit they eat.
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him immediately; and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before
•
ADVENTURES OF
before he began to be sick, and out of order; so he
stopped a while, and our surgeon mixed him up some-
thing with some broth, which he said would be to him
both food and physic; and after he had taken it, he
grew better: in the mean time, I forgot not the men;
I ordered victuals to be given them; and the poor crea-
tures rather devoured than eat it: they were so exceed-
ing hungry, that they were in a kind ravenous, and had
no command of themselves; and two of them ate with
so much greediness, that they were in danger of their
lives the next morning. The sight of these people's distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible pros-
pect of at my first coming on shore in my island,
where I had never the least mouthful of food, or any
prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly apprehen-
sions I had of being made the food of other creatures.
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the
miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not
put out my of thought the story he had told me of the
three poor creatures in the great cabin, viz. the mo-
ther, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had
heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom, he
seemed to confess, they had wholly neglected, their own
extremities being so great: by which I understood,
that they had really given them no food at all, and that
therefore they must be perished, and be all lying dead
perhaps on the floor or deck of the cabin. As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called
captain, on board with his men, to refresh them, so I
also forgot not the starving crew that were left on board; but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and, with my mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of
bread, and four or five pieces of beef to boil. Our sur-
geon geon charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled
while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room,
to prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it
out of the pot before it was well boiled, and then to
give every man but a very little at a time: and by this
caution he preserved the men, who would otherwise
have killed themselves with that very food that was
given them on purpose to save their lives. At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the
great cabin, and see what condition the poor passen-
gers were in; and if they were alive, to comfort them,
and give them what refreshment was proper: and the
surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some of the pre-
pared broth which he had given the mate that was
on board, and which he did not question would restore
them gradually. I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above,
having a great mind to seethe scene of misery which I
knew the ship itself would present me with, in a more
lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the
captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me,
and went myself, a little after, in their boat. I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult,
to get the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready;
but my mate observed his orders, and kept a good guard
at the cook-room door; and the man he placed there,
after using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept
them off by force: however, he caused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened with the li-
quor of the meat, which they called brewis, and gave
them every one some, to stay their stomachs, and told
them it was for their own safety that he was obliged to
give them but little at a time: but it was all in vain-,
and had I not come on board, and their own comman-
der
ADVENTURES Of
der and officers with me, and with good words, and some threats also of giving them no more, I believe
they would have broken into the cook-room by force,
and tore the meat out of the furnace; for words are in-
deed of very small force to a hungry belly: however, we
pacified them, and fed them gradually and cautiously
for the first, and the next time gave them more, and at
last filled their bellies, and the men did well enough. But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin
was of another nature, and far beyond the rest; for as
first the ship's company had so little for themselves, it was
but too true that they had at first kept them very low,
and at last totally neglected them; so that for six or se-
ven days it might be said they had really no food at
all, and for several days before very little. The poor
mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman of
sense and good breeding, had spared all she could so
affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely sunk
under it; and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat
upon the floor or deck, with her back up against the
sides, between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her
head sunk between her shoulders, like a corpse, though
not quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive and
encourage her, and with a spoon put some broth into
her mouth. She opened her lips, and lifted up one
hand, but could not speak; yet she understood what he
said, and made signs to him, intimating that it was
too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she would
have said they should take care of him. However,
the mate, who was exceedingly moved with the sight,
endeavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth,
and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down;
though I question whether he could be sure of it or
not: but it was too late, and she died the same night. The
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone; yet
he lay in a cabin-bed, as one stretched out, with
hardly any life left in him. He had apiece of an old
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it: however, being young, and having more strength than
his mother, the mate got something down his throat,
and he began sensibly to revive; though by giving him,
some time after, but two or three spoonfuls extraordi-
nary, he was very sick, and brought it up again. But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all
along upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like
one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and strug-
gled for life. Her limbs were distorted; one of her
hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, and she
griped it so hard, that we could not easily make her let
it go: her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay
both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin-table: in short, she lay just like one in the agonies of
death, and yet she was alive too. The poor creature was not only starved with hunger,
and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the
men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her
mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three days be-
fore, and whom she loved most tenderly. We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great know-
ledge and experience, had, with great application, reco-
vered her as to life, he had her upon his hands as to
her senses; for she was little less than distracted fora
considerable time after, as shall appear presently. Whoever shall read these memorandums must be
desired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a jour-

ADVENTURES Of
'ney into the country, where sometimes people stay a
week or a fortnight at a place; our business was to re-
lieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for
them; and though they were willing to steer the same
course with us for some days, yet we could carry no
sail, to keep pace with a ship that had no masts: how-
ever, as their captain begged of us to help him to setup
a main-topmast, and a kind of a topmast to his jury
foremast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or
four days; and then having given him five barrels of
beef, a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a
proportion of peas, flour, and what other things we
could spare; and taking three casks of sugar, some rum,
and some pieces of eight from them for satisfaction, we
left them; taking on board with us, at their own earn-
est request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods. The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a
pretty, well-bred, modest and sensible youth, greatly
dejected with the loss of his mother, and, as it seems,
had lost his father but a few months before, at Barbadoes: he begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take
him out of the ship; for, he said, the cruel fellows had
murdered his mother; and indeed so they had, that is
to say, passively; for they might have spared a small
sustenance to the poor helpless widow, that might
have preserved her life, though it had been but just
enough to keep her alive: but hunger knows no friend,
no relation, no justice, no right; and therefore is re-
morseless, and capable of no compassion. The surgeon told him how far we were going, and
that it would carry him away from all his friends, and
put him perhaps in as bad circumstances almost as
those we found him in, that is to say, starving in the world.
World. He said it mattered not whither he went, if
he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he was
among; that the captain (by which he meant me, for
he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his
life, and he was sure would not hurt him; and as
for the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she
would be very thankful for it, let us carry them where
we would. The surgeon represented the case so affec-
tionately to me, that I yielded, and we took them both
on board, with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads
of sugar, which could not be removed or come at; and
as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I made his
commander sign a writing, obliging himself to go, as
soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a mer-
chant there, to whom the youth said he was related,
and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all
the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow;
which I suppose was not done, for I could never learn
that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most pro-
bable, lost at sea; being in so disabled a condition, and
so far from any land, that I am of opinion the first
storm she met with afterwards she might founder in the
sea; for she was leaky, and had damage in her hold, when we met with her. I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and had
hitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather, though, at
first, the winds had been contrary. I shall trouble no-
body with the little incidents of wind, weather, cur-
rents, &c. on the rest of our voyage; but, to shorten
my story, for the sake of what is to follow, shall observe,
that I came to my old habitation, the island, on the
10th of April, 1695. It was with no small difficulty
that I found the place; for as I came to it, and went
Vol. II. D from
ADVENTURES OF
from it, before, on the south and east side of the island,
as coming from the Brazils, so now, coming in between
the main and the island, and having no chart for the
coast, or any land-mark, I did not know it when I saw
it, or know whether I saw it or not. We beat about a great while, and went on shore on
several islands in the mouth of the great river Oronoo-
que, "but none for my purpose; only this I learned by
my coasting the shore, that I was under one great mis-
take before, viz. that the continent which I thought I
saw from the island I lived in, was really no continent,
but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching
from one to the other side of the extended mouth of that great river; and that the savages who came to my island were not properly those which we call Caribbees, but
islanders, and other barbarians of the same kind, who
inhabited something nearer to our side than the rest. In short, I visited several of these islands to no pur-
pose; some I found were inhabited, and some were not:
on one of them I found some Spaniards, and thought
they had lived there; but speaking with them, found
they had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by, and came thither to make salt and to catch some pearl
muscles, if they could; but that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay farther north, in the latitude of
10 and 11 degrees. Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes
with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchmen's shal- .lop, which we had found a convenient boat, and there-
fore kept her with their very good will, at length I came
fair on the south side of my island, and presently
knew the very countenance of the place: so I brought
the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with the little creek
where was my old habitation. 5 . As
35
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and
asked him if he knew where he was; he looked about a
little, and presently_clappi,ng his hands, cried, O yes,
0 there, O yes, O there, pointing to our old habita-
tion, and fell dancing and capering like a mad fel-
low; and I had much ado to keep him from jumping
into the sea, to swim ashore to the place. Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall sind any
body here or no? And what do you think, shall we see
your sather? The fellow stood mute as a stock a good
while, but when I named his father, the poor affec-
tionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears
run down his face very plentifully. What is the
matter, Friday? says I; are you troubled because you
may see your father? No, no, says he, shaking his
head, no see him more; no never more fee again. Why
so, said I, Friday; how do you know that? O no, O
no, says Friday; he long ago die, long ago; he much old
man. Well, well, says I, Friday, you don't know; but
shall we see any one else then? The fellow, it seems, had
better eyes than I, and he points to the hill just above
my old house; and though we lay half a league off, he
cries out, We see, we fee; yes, yes, we see much man
there, and there, and there. I looked, but I could fee
nobody, no, not with a perspective glass, which was,
1 suppose, because I could not hit the place; for the fel-
low was right, as I found upon inquiry the next day;
and there were five or six men all together, who stood to
look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us. As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused
the English ancient to be spread, and fired three guns,
to give them notice we were friends; and in about
half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a smoke D 2 arise
ADVENTURES OF
arise from the side of the creek; so I immediately order-
ed a boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging out
a white flag, or a flag of truce, I went directly on shore,
taking with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom
I had told the whole story of my living there, and the
manner of it, and every particular both of myself and
those I left there, and who was, on that account, ex-
tremely desirous to go with me. We had besides about
sixteen men very well armed, if we had found any new
guests there which we did not know of; but we had no
need of weapons.
As we went ashore upon the tide of flood, near high
water, we rowed directly into the creek; and the first
man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard whose life I
had saved, and who I knew by his sace perfectly well:
as to his habit, I shall describe it afterwards. I ordered
nobody to go ashore at first but myself; but there was
no keeping Friday in the boat, for the affectionate crea-
ture had spied his sather at a distance, a good way off
of the Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of him;
and if they had not let him go ashore, he would have
jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but
he flew av.'ay to his sather, like an arrow out of a bow.
It would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the
firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of
this poor fellow's joy when he came to his sather: how
he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his sace, took him
up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down
by him, then stood and looked at him, as any one
would look at a strange picture, fora quarter of an hour
together, then lie down on the ground, and stroke his
legs, and kiss them, and then get up again, and stare at
him; one would have thought the fellow bewitched.
Bus
But it would have made a dog laugh to see howthe next
day his passion ran out another way; in the morning
he walked along the shore, to and again, with his father several hours, always leading him by the hand, as
if he had been a lady; and every now and then he would
come to fetch something or other for him to the boat,
either a lump of sugar, a dram, a biscuit-cake, or some-
thing or other that was good. In the afternoon his
frolicks run another way; for then he would set the
old man down upon the ground and dance about him,
and make a thousand antic postures and gestures; and
all the while he did this, he would be talking to him,
and telling him one story or other of his travels, and of
what had happened to him abroad, to divert him. In
short, if the same filial affection was to be found in
Christians to their parents in our part of the world,
one would be tempted to say, there would hardly have
been any need of the fifth commandment. But this is a digression: I return to my landing. It
would be needless to take notice of all the ceremonies
and civilities that the Spaniards received me with. The
first Spaniard, who, as I said, I knew very well, was he
whose life I had saved; he came towards the boat, at-
tended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also; and
he not only not know me at first, but he had no
thoughts, no notion of its being me that was come, till
I spoke to him. Seignior, said I in Portuguese, do
you not know me? At which he spoke not a word, but
giving his musket to the man that was with him, threw
his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish that I
did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me;
telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face again, that he had once seen as if an angel from heaD 3 veil
ADVENTURES OF
ven sent to save his life: he said abundance of very
handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows
how, and then beckoning to the person that attended
him, bade him go and call out his comrades. He then
asked me if I would walk to my old habitation, where he
would give me possession of my own house again, and
where I should see they had made but mean improve-
ments: so I walked alongwith him; but, alas, 1 could no
more find the place again than if I had never been
there; for they had planted so many trees, and placed
them in such a posture, so thick and close to one another, and in ten years time they were grown so big,
that, in short, the place was inaccessible, except by such
windings and blind ways as they themselves only, who
made them, could find. I asked them what put them upon all these fortifica-
tions: he told me, I would say there was need enough
of it, when they had given me an account how they
had passed their time since their arriving in the island,
especially after they had the misfortune to find that I was
gone. He told me he could not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone
in a good ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he had
oftentimes a strong persuasion that, one time or other, he
should see me again; but nothing that ever befell him in
his life, he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him
at first, as the disappointment he was under when he
came back to the island and found I was not there. As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that
were left behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long
story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought themselves
much better among the savages, only that their num-
ber was so small: and, says he, had they been strong enough
39
enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory; arid
with that he crossed himself on the breast. But, Sir, says
he, I hope you will not be displeased when I shall tell
you, how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for our
own preservation, to disarm them, and make them our
subjects, who would not be content with being mode-
rately our masters, but would be our murderers. I
answered, I was heartily afraid of it when I left them
there, and nothing troubled me at my parting from
the island but that they were not come back, that I
might have put them in possession of every thing first,
and left the others in a state of subjection, as they de-
served; but if they had reduced them to it, I was very
glad, and should be very far from sinding any fault with
it: for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned villains, and were fit for any manner of mis-
chief. While I was saying this, the man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven men more. In the
dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what na-
tion they were of; but he made all clear, both to them and
to me. First he turned to me, and pointing to them,
said, these, Sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe
their lives to you; and then turning to them, and
pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon
which they all came up, one by one, not as if they had
been sailors and ordinary fellows, and the like, but
really as if theyhad been ambassadors of noblemen, and
I a monarch or great conqueror: their behaviour was to
the last degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed
with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well be-
came them; and, in short, they had so much more
manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their
civilities, much less how to return them in kind. D 4 The
*
The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the
island, after my going away, is so very remarkable, and
has so many incidents, which the former part of my
relation will help to understand, and which will, in
most of the particulars, refer to the account I have al-
ready given, that I cannot but commit them, with great
delight, to the reading of those that come after me. I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in
the first person, which will put me totheexpence of ten
thousandsaid Fs, and said he's, and he told me's, and / told
him's, and the like; but I shall collect the facts histori-
cally, as near as I can gather them out of my memory,
from what they related tome, and from what I met
with in my conversing with them and with the place. In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as
I can, I must go back to the circumstances in which I
left the island, and in which the persons were of whom
I am to speak. And first, it is necessary to repeat, that
I had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard,the
two whose lives Thad rescued from the savages; 1 say, I
had sent them away in a large canoe, to the main, as I
then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's companions
that he left behind him, in order to save them from the
like calamity that he had been in, and in order to succour
them for the present; and that, if possible, we might
together find some way for our deliverance afterwards. When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance
of, or the least room to hope for, my own deliverance,
any more than I had twenty years before, much less
had I any foreknowledge of what afterwards happened,
I mean, of an English ship coming on shore there to
fetch me off; and it could not but be a very great sur-
prise to them, when they came back, not only to find that
4i
that I was gone, but to find three strangers left on the
spot, possessed of all that I had left behind me, which
would otherwise have been their own. The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that
I might begin where I left off, was of their own part;
and I desired he would give me a particular account of
his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat, when
I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was
little variety in that part, for nothing remarkable hap-
pened to them on the way, having very calm wea-
ther, and a smooth sea: for his countrymen, it could not
be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to -
fee him; (it seems he was the principal man among
them, the captain of the vessel they had been shipwreck-
ed in having been dead some time); they were, he
said, the more surprised to see him, because they knew
that he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who,
they were satisfied, would devour him, as they did all
the rest of their prisoners; that when he told them the
story of his deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished for carrying them away, it was like a dream
to them, and their astonishment, he said, was some-
what like that of Joseph's brethren, when he told
them who he was, and told them the story of his exal-
tation in Pharaoh's court; but when he showed them
the arms, the powder, the ball, and provisions, that
he brought them for their journey or voyage, they were
restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy of
their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come
away with him. Their first business was to get canoes: and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest
part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly savages, and
and to borrow two large canoes, or periaguas, on pre-
tence of going out a fishing, or for pleasure. In these
they came away the next morning. It seems they want-
ed no time to get themselves ready; for they had no bag-
gage, neither cloaths nor provisions, nor any thing in
the world but what they had on them, and a few roots
to eat, of which they used to make their bread. They were mall three weeks absent; and in that time,
unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my
escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and to get off
from the island, leaving three of the most impudent,
hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains behind me,
that any man could desire to meet with; to the poor
Spaniards' great grief and disappointment, you may be
sure. The only just thing the rogues did was, that when
the Spaniards came ashore, they gave my letter to them,
and gave them provisions, and other relief, as I had
ordered them to do; also they gave them the long pa-
per of directions which I had left with them, contain-
ing the particular methods which I took for managing
every part of my life there; the way how I baked my
bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my corn; how
I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, every
thing I did; all this being written down, they gave
to the Spaniards;two of them understood English well
enough): nor did they refuse to accommodate the Spa-
niards with any thing else, for they agreed very well
for some time. They gave them an equal admission in-
to the house, or cave, and they began to live very socia-
bly; and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of
my methods, and Friday's father together, managed all their affairs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing
nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and
catch tortoises; and when they came home at night, the
Spaniards provided their suppers for them. The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
had the others but let them alone; which, how-
ever, they could not find in their hearts to do long,
but, like the dog in the manger, they would not eat
themselves, neither would they let others eat neither.: the
differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and
such as are not worth relating, but at last it broke out
into open war: and it began with all the rudeness and
insolence that can be imagined, without reason, with-
out provocation, contrary to nature, and indeed to com-
mon sense; and though, it is true, the first relation of
it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may
call the accusers, yet when I came to examine the fel-
lows, they could not deny a word of it. But before I come to the particulars of this part, I
must supply a defect in my former relation; and this
was, that 1 forgot to set down, among the rest, that
just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, there
happened a little quarrel on board of our ship, which
I was afraid once would have turned to a second muti-
ny; nor was it appeased till the captain, rousing up his
courage, and taking us all to his assistance, parted them
by force, and making two of the most refractory fel-
lows prisoners, he laid them in irons; and as they had
been active in the former disorders, and let fall some
ugly, dangerous words, the second time he threatened
to carry them in irons to England, and have them
hanged there for mutiny, and running away with the
ship. This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to
do it, frightened some other men in the ship; and some of
ADVENTURES OF
of them had put it into the heads of the rest that the
captain only gave them good words for the present, till
they should come to some English port, and that then
they should be all put into gaol, and tried for their
lives. The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with it; upon which it was desired that I, who still pas-
sed for a great man among them, should go down with
the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell them that they
might be assured, if they behaved well the rest of the
voyage, all they had done for the time past should be
pardoned. So I went, and after passing my honour's
word to them, they appeared easy, and the more so
when I caused the two men that were in irons to be
released and forgiven. But this mutiny had brought
us to an anchor for that night; the wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our two men who
had been laid in irons had stole each of them a musket,
and some other weapons, (what powder or shot they had
we knew not), and had taken the ship's pinnace, which
was not yet haled up, and runaway with her to
their companions in roguery on shore. As soon as we
found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore, with
twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek
the rogues; but they could neither find them or any of
the rest, for they all fled into the woods when they saw
the boat coming on shore. The mate was once re-
solved, in justice to their roguery, to have destroyed
their plantations, burned all their household-stuff and
furniture, and left them to shift without it; but hav-
ing no orders, he let it all alone, left every thing as
he found it, and bringing the pinnace away, came
on board without them. These two men made their number
45
number five; but the other three villains were so much
wickeder than they, that after they had been two or
three days together, they turned the two new-comers
out of doors to shift for themselves, and would have no-
thing to do with them; nor could they, for a good
while, be persuaded to give them any food: as for the
Spaniards, they were not yet come. When the Spaniards came first on shore, the busi-
ness began to go forward: the Spaniards would have
persuaded the three English brutes to have taken in
their two countrymen again, that, as they said, they
might be all one family; but they would not hear of it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves, and find-
ing nothing but industry and application would make
them live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the
north shore of the island, but a little more to the west,
to be out of danger of the savages, who always landed
on the east parts of the island. Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and
the other to lay up their magazines and stores in; and
the Spaniards having given them some corn for seed,
and especially some of the peas which I had left them,
they dug and planted, and enclosed, after the pattern
I had set for them all, and began to live pretty well.
Their first crop of corn was on the ground; and though
it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at
first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to
relieve them, and find them with bread and other eat-
ables; and one of the fellows being the cook's-mate of
the ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings,
and such other preparations as the rice and the milk,
and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to do. They were going on in this little thriving posture,
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country-
men
men too, in mere humour, and to insult them, came
and bullied them, and told them the island was theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had given them the
possession of it, and nobody else had any right to it;
and, damn them, they should build no houses upon
their ground, unless they would pay rent for them. The two men thought they had jested at first, asked
them to come in and sit down, and see what fine houses
they were that they had built, and to tell them what
rent they demanded; and one of them merrily told
them, if they were ground-landlords, he hoped, if they
built tenements upon their land, and made improve-
ments, they would, according to the custom of land-
lords, grant a long lease: and bade them go fetch
a scrivener to draw the writings. One of the three,
cursing and raging, told them they shouldsee they were
not in jest; and going to a little place at a distance,
where the honest men had made a fire to dress their vic-
tuals, he takes a fire-brand, and claps it to the out-
side of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire; and it
would have been all burnt down in a few minutes, if
one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him
away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and that not
without some difficulty too. The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he returned upon him, with a
pole he had in his hand, and had not the man avoided
the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had
ended his days at once; his comrade seeing the danger
they were both in, ran in after him, and immediately
they came both out with their muskets, and the man
that was first struck at with the pole, knocked the fel-
low down that had begun the quarrel with the stock of
of his musket, and that before the other two could
come to help him; and then seeing the rest come at
them, they stood together, and presenting the other
ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off.
The others had fire-arms with them too; but one
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and
made desperate by his danger, told them, if they offer-
ed to move hand or foot, they were dead men, and
boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.
They did not indeed lay down their arms, but seeing
him so resolute, it brought them to a parley; and they
consented to take their wounded man with them and be
gone; and indeed it seems the fellow was wounded suf-
ficiently with the blow. However, they were much in
the wrong, since they had the advantage, that they did
nqt disarm them affectually, as they might have done,
and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given
them an account how the rogues had treated them; for
the three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every
day gave them some intimation that they did so.
- But not to croud this part with an account of the
lesser part of the rogueries, such as treading down their
corn, shooting three young kids and a she-goat, which
the poor men had got to breed up tame for their
store; and, in a word, plaguing them night and day
in this manner, it forced the two men to such a des-
peration, that they resolved to fight them all three, the
first time they had a sair opportunity. In order to this,
they resolved to go to the Castle, as they called it, that
was my old dwelling, where the three rogues and the
Spaniards all lived together, at that time, intending to
have a sair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by, to
see sair play: so they got up in the morning before day,
and
and came to the place, and called the Englishmen by
their names, telling a Spaniard that answered that they
wanted to speak with them. It happened that the day before, two of the Spaniards, having been in the woods, had seen one of the two
Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I called the ho-
nest men, and he had made a sad complaint to the Spa-
niards of the barbarous usage they had met with from
their three countrymen, and how they had ruined
their plantation, and destroyed their corn that they had
laboured so hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three kids, which was all they had pro-
vided for their sustenance; and that if he and his
friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them
again, they should be starved. When the Spaniards
came home at night, and.gthey were all at supper, one
of them took the freedom to reprove the three English-
men, though in very gentleand mannerly terms, and ask-
ed them how they could be so cruel, they being harm-
less, inoffensive fellows; that they were putting
themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that
it had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things
to such perfection as they had. One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What
had they to do there? that they came on shore with-
out leave; and that they should not plant or build up-
on the island; it was none of their ground. Why,
says the Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior Inglese, they
must not starve. The Englishman replied, like a
rough-hewn tarpauling, They might starve and be
damned; they should not plant nor build in that place.
But what must they do then, seignior? said the Spa-
niard: another of the brutes returned, Do? d—n
them,
them, they should be servants, and work for them.
But how can you expect that of them? says the Spaniard;
they'are net bought with your money: you have no
right to make them servants. The Englishman an-
swered, the island was theirs; the governor had given
it to them, and no man had any thing to do there but
themselves; and with that, swore by his Maker, that
they would go and burn all their new huts; they should
build none upon their land.
Why, seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same rule,
we must be your servants too. Aye, says the bold dog,
and so you shall too, before we have done with you;
(mixing two or three G—d d—n me's in the proper
intervals of his speech) the Spaniard only smiled at that,
and made him no answer. However, this little dis-
course had heated them; and starting up, one says to
the other, I think it was he they called Will. Atkins,
Come, Jack, let's go, and have t'other brush with
'em; we'll demolish their castle, I'll warrant you; they
shall plant no colony in our dominions.
Upon this they went all trooping away, with every
man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some
insolent things among themselves, of what they would
do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity offered; but
the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand
them as to know all the particulars, only that, in ge-
neral, they threatened them hard for taking the two
Englishmen's parts.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time
that evening, the Spaniards said, they did not know;
but it seems they wandered about the country part of
the night, and then lying down in the place which I
used to call my Bower, they were weary, and over-
Vol. II. E slept
So Adventures of
slept themselves. The case was this; they had resolv-
ed to stay till midnight, and so to take the two poor
men when they were asleep, and, as they acknowledged
afterwards, intended to set fire to their huts while they
were in them, and either burn them in them, or mur-
der them as they came out; as malice seldom sleeps
very sound, it was very strange they should not have
been kept awake.
However, as the two men had also a design upon
them, as I have said, though a much fairer one than
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and very
luckily for them all, that they were up, and gone abroad,
before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts. When they came there, and found the men gone, At-
kins, who, it seems, was the forwardest man, called out
to his comrades, Ha, Jack, here's the nest, but, d—n them, the birds are flown. They mused a while to
think what should be the occasion of their being gone
abroad so soon, and suggested presently that the Spa-
niards had given them notice of it: and with that they
shook hands, and swore to one another that they would
be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had
made this bloody bargain, they fell to work with the
poor men's habitation; they did not set fire indeed to
any thing, but they pulled down both their houses,
and pulled them so limb from limb, that they left not
the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground
where they stood: they tore all their little collected
household-stuff in pieces, and threw every thing about
in such a manner, that the poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile off their habitation. When they had done this, they pulled up all the
young trees which the poor men had planted ; pulled up
tip an enclosure they had made to secure their cattle and
their corn; and, in a word, sacked and plundered every-
thing as compleatly as a hord of Tartars would have
done.
The two men were at this juncture gone to find
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever
they had been, though they were but two to three; so
that, had they met, there certainly Would haVe been
bloodshed among them; for they were all Very stout,
resolute fellows, to give them their due.
But Providence took more care to keep them asun-
der, than they themselves could do to meet; for, as if
they had dogged one another, when the three were
gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards, When
the two went back to find them, the three were come
to the old habitation again: we shall see their different
Conduct presently. When the three came back like
furious creatures, flushed with the rage which the work
they had been about had put them into, they came up
to the Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by
way of scoff and bravado; and one of them stepping up
to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of
boys at play, takes hold of his hat, as it Was upon his
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his sace,
fays he to him, " And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard,
"shall have the same sauce, if you do not mend your
"manners." The Spaniard, who, though a quiet,
civil man, Was as brave as a man could be desired to be,
and withal a strong, well-made man, looked steadily
at him for a good while, and then having no weapon
in his hand, stept gravely up to him, and with one
blow of his fist knocked him down, as an ox is felled
with a pole-axe ; at which, one of the rogues, as info-
E 2 lent
lent as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard imme-
diately: he missed his body, indeed, for thehullets went
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of
his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood made the
Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he really was,
and that put him into some heat, for before he acted
all in a perfect calm; but now resolving to go through
with his work, he stooped, and took the fellow's musket
whom he had knocked down, and was just going to
shoot the man who had fired at him, when the rest
of the Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and
calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured
the other two, and took their arms from them. When they were thus disarmed, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their
own countrymen, they began to cool, and, giving the
Spaniards better words, would have their arms again;
but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was be-
tween them and the other two Englishmen, and that
it would be the best method they could take to keep
them from killing one another, told them they would
do them no harm, and if they would live peaceably,
they would be very willing to assist and associate with
them as they did before; but that they could not think
of giving them their arms again, while they appeared
so resolved to do mischief with them to their own
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to
make them their servants. The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason
than to act with reason; but being refused their arms,
they went raving away, and raging like madmen,
threatening what they would do, though they had no
fire-arms. But the Spaniards, despising their threatening, told
S
53
told them they should take care how they offered any
injury to their plantation or cattle, for if they did, they
would shoot them as they would ravenous beasts,
wherever they found them; and if they fell into their
hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. However,
this was far from cooling them, but away they went, rag-
ing and swearing like furies of hell. As soon as they
were gone, came backthe two men, in passion and rage
enough also, though of another kind; for having been
at their plantation, and finding it all demolished and
destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had
provocation enough: they could scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them
theirs; and it was strange enough to find that three
men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punish-
ment at all. The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially
having thus disarmed them, made light of their threaten-
ings; but'the two Englishmen resolved to have their re-
medy against them, what pains soever itcost to find them
out. But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that as they had disarmed them, they could not
consent that they (the two) should pursue them with
fire-arms, and perhaps kill them: but, said the grave
Spaniard, who was their governor, we will endeavour
to make them do you justice, if you will leave it to us: for there is no doubt but they will come to us
again, when their passion is over, being not able to
subsist without our assistance; wo promise you to make
no peace with them, without having a full satisfaction for you; and upon this condition we hope you will
promise to use no violence with them, other than
in your own defence. The two Englishmen yielded
to this very awkwardly, and with great reluctance; but
E 3 the
ADVENTURES OF
the Spaniards protested, they did it only to keep them
from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last: for, said
they, we are not so many of us; here is room enough
for us all, and it is a great pity we should not be
all good friends. At length they did consent, and wait-
ed for the issue of the thing, living for some days with
the Spaniards; for their own habitation was destroyed. In about five days time the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger,
having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came
back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard, who,
as I have said, was the governor, and two more with
him walking by the side of the creek, they came up
in a very submissive, humble manner, and begged to be
received again into the family. The Spaniards used
them civilly, but told them they had acted so unnatu-
rally by their countrymen, and so very grossly by
them (the Spaniards), that they could not come to any
conclusion without consulting the two Englishmen and
the rest; but, however, they would go to them, and
discourse about it, and they should know in half an
hour. It may be guessed that they were very hard put
to it: for, it seems, as they were to wait this half hour
for an answer, they begged they would send them out
some bread in the mean time, which they did; and sent
them, at the same time, a large piece of goat's flesh,
and a boiled parrot, which they eat very heartily, for
they were hungry enough.
Aster half an hour's consultation, they were called in,
and a long debate had among them, their two country-
men charging them with the ruin of all their labour,
and a design to murder them; all which they owned
before, and therefore could not deny now. Upon the whole,
whole, the Spaniards acted the moderator between them;
and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not to
hurt the three while they were naked and unarmed, so
they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their fel-
lows' two huts, one to be of the same, and the other of
larger dimensions than they were before; to fence their
ground again where they had pulled up their fences,
plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the
land again for planting corn where they had spoiled it,
and, in a word, to restore every thing in the same state
as they found it, as near as they could; for entirely it
could not be, the season for the corn, and the growth
of the trees and hedges, not being possible to be reco-
vered. Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to live
pleasantly and agreeably together again; only, that
these three fellows could never be persuaded to work,
I mean for themselves, except now and then a little,
just as they pleased: however, the Spaniards told them
plainly, that if they would but live sociably and friendly
together, and study the good of the whole plantation,
they would be content to work for them, and let
them walk about and be as idle as they pleased: and
thus having lived pretty well together for a month or
two, the Spaniards gave them arms again, and gave
them liberty to go abroad with them as before. It was not above a week after they had these arms and
went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began to be
as insolent and troublesome as before: but, however,
an accident happened presently upon this, which en-
dangered the safety of them all; and they were obliged
E 4 to
to lay by all private resentments, and look to the preser-
vation of their lives. It happened one night that the Spanish governor,
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader, or go-
vernor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the
night, and could by no means get any sleep: he was
perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only
found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon
men fighting and killing of one another, but was broad
awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; in
short, he lay a great while; but growing more and
more uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so
many of th m, upon goat-skins, laid thick upon such
couches and pads as they made for themselves, and not
in hammocks and ship-beds, as I did, who was but one, so they had little to do, when they were willing
to rise, but to get up upon their feet, and perhaps put
on a coar, 'such as it was, and their pumps, and they
were ready forgoing any way that their thoughts guid-
ed them. Being thus got up, he looked out; but, being
dark, he could see little or nothing; and, besides, the
trees which I had planted, as in my former account
is described, and which were now grown tall, inter-
cepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see
that it was a clear star-light night, and hearing no noise,
he returned and laid him down again: but it was all
one; he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself
to any thing like rest; but his thoughts were to the last
degree uneasy, and he knew not for what. Having made some noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them waked, and
and calling, asked who it was that was up. The go-
vernor told him how it had been with him. Say you
so, says the other Spaniard, such things are not to be
slighted, I assure you; there is certainly some mischief
working, says he, near us; and presently he asked him^
where are the Englishmen? They are all in their huts,
fays he, safe enough. It seems the Spaniards had kept
possession of the main apartment, and had made a place
for the three Englishmen, since their last mutiny,
always quartered by themselves, and could not come at
the rest. Well, says the Spaniard, there is something
in it, I am persuaded, from my own experience. I am satisfied our spirits embodied have a converse with,
and receive intelligence from, the spirits unembodied,
and inhabiting the invisible world; and this friendly
notice is given for our advantage, if we knew how to
make use of it. Come, says he, let us go and look
abroad; and if we find nothing atall in it to justify the
trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose, that shall
convince you of the justice of my proposing it. In a word, they went out, to go up to the top of the
hill, where I used to go; but they being strong, and a good
company, not alone, as I was, used none of my cau-
tions, to go up by the ladder, and pulling it up after
them, to go up a second stage to the top, but were go-
ing round through the grove, unconcerned and unwa-
ry, when they were surprised with seeing a light as of
fire, a very little way off from them, and hearing the
voices of men, not of one or two, but of a great num-
ber. In all the discoveries I had made of the savages land-
ing on the island, it was my constant care to prevent
them making the least discovery of there being any in-
habitant habitant upon the place; and when by any occasion
they came to know it, they felt it so effectually, that
they that got away were scarce able to give any ac-
count of it; for we disappeared as soon as possible; nor
did ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else,
except it was the three savages in our last encounter,
who jumped into the boat; of whom, I mentioned that I
was afraid they should go home and bring more help. Whether it was the consequence of the escape of
those men that so great a number came now together,
or whether they came ignorantly, and by accident, on
their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it
seems, understand; but, whatever it was, it had been
their business either to have concealed themselves, or
not to have seen them at all, much less to have let the
savages have seen that there were any inhabitants in the
place; or to have fallen upon them so effectually, as
that not a man of them should have escaped, which
could only have been by getting in between them and
their boats: but this presence of mind was wanting to
them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a
great while. We need not doubt, but that the governor and the
man with him, surprised with this sight, ran back
immediately, and raised their fellows, giving them an
account of the imminent danger they were all in, and
they again as readily took the alarm; but it was
impossible to persuade them to stay close within, where
they were, but they must run all out, to see how
things stood. While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and
they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to view
them by the light of three fires they had made at a dis-
tance tance from one another; what they were doing they
knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not. For, first, the enemy were too many; and, secondly,
they did not keep together, but were divided into seve-
ral parties, and were on shore in several places. The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this
sight; and as they found that the fellows ran straggling
all over the shore, they made no doubt but, first or
last, some of them would chop in upon their habita-
tion, or upon some other place where they would see the token of inhabitants; and they were in great per-
plexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which would
have been little less than starving them, if they should
have been destroyed; so the first thing they resolved
upon, was to dispatch three men away before it was
light, two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive
all the goats away to the great valley where the cave
was, and, if need were, to drive them into the very
cave itself. Could they have seen the savages all together in one
body, and at a distance from their canoes, they resolv-
ed, if there had been a hundred of them, to have at-
tacked them; but that could not be obtained; for they
were some of them two miles off from the other; and,
as it appeared afterwards, were of two different nations. After having mused a great while on the course they
should take, and beating their brains in considering
their present circumstances, they resolved, at last,
while it was still dark, to send the old savage, Friday's
father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible, something
concerning them; as what they came for, what they
intended to do, and the like. The old man readily
undertook it; and stripping himself quite naked, as most
most of the savages were, away he went. After he
had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he
had been among them undiscovered; that he found
they were two parties, and of two several nations, who
had war with one another, and had a great battle in their
own country: and that both sides having had several
prisoners taken in the fight, they were, by mere chance,
landed all on the same island, for the devouring their
prisoners and making merry; but, tlteir coming so by
chance to the same place had spoiled all their mirth;
that they were in a great rage at one another, and were
so near, that he believed they would fight again as soon
as day-light began to appear: but he did not perceive
that they had any notion of any body being on the
island but themselves. He had hardly made an end of
telling his story, when they could perceive, by the un-
usual noise they made, that the two little armies were
engaged in a bloody sight. .: .,
Friday's father used all the arguments he could to
persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen; he
told them their safety consisted in it, and that they had
nothing to do but lie still, and the savages would kill
one another to their hands, and then the rest would go
away; and it was so to a tittle. But it was impossible
to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their cu-
riosity was so importunate upon their prudentials, that
they must run out and see the battle: however, they
used some caution too, viz. they did not go openly,
just by their own dwelling, but went farther into the
woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where they might securely see them manage the fight, and, as they
thought, not be seen by them; but it seems the sa-
vages did see them, as we shall find hereafter. The
The battle was very fierce; and, if I might believe
the Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of great bravery, of in-
vincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding the fight.
The battle, they said, held two hours before they could guess which party would be beaten; but then that par-
ty which was nearest our people's habitation began to
appear weakest, and, after some time more, some of
them began to fly; and this put our men again into a
great consternation, lest any one of those that fled,
Ihould run into the grove before their dwelling for
shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the place; and that, by consequence, the pursuers would do the
like in search of them. Upon this they resolved
that they would stand armed within the wall, and who-
ever came into the grove, they resolved to sally out
over the wall and kill them ; so that, if possible, not one should return to give an account of it: they order-
ed also that it should be done with their swords, or by
knocking them down with the stocks of their muskets,
but not by shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm
by the noise. As they expected it fell out: three of the routed ar-
my fled for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly
into the place, not in the least knowing whither they
went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter. The
scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of this
within, with this addition, to our men's great satis-
faction, viz. that the conquerors had not pursued them,
or seen which way they were gone; upon this, the Spa-
niard governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer
them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three men
out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go round, and
It

and come in behind them, surprize and take them prisoners, which was done. The residue of the conquer-
ed people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the
victors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but
drawing themselves into a body together, gave two
great screaming shouts, which they supposed was by
way of triumph, and so the fight ended. And the
same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they
also marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had their island again free to themselves, their fright
was over, and they saw no savages in several years
after. After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their den, and viewing the field of battle, they found
about two and thirty men dead on the spot: some
were killed with great long arrows, some of which
were found sticking in their bodies; but most of them
were killed with great wooden swords, sixteen or se-
venteen of which they found in the field of battle, and
as many bows, with a great many arrows. These
swords were strange, great, unwieldy things, and they
must be very strong men that used them: most of
those men that were killed with them had their heads
mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as we call it in
English, their brains knocked out, and several their
arms and legs broken; so that it is evident they fight
with inexpressible rage and fury. We found not one
man that was not stone-dead, for either they stay by
their enemy till they have quite killed him, or they
carry all the wounded men that are not quite dead
away with them. This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great
while; the sight had filled them with horror, and the con-
Consequences appeared terrible to the last degree, espe-
cially upon supposing that some time or other they
should fall into the hands of those creatures, who would
not only kill them as enemies, but kill them for food,
as we kill our cattle; and they professed to me, that
the thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton,
though it was supposed it was not to be till they were
dead, had something in it so horrible, that it nauseat-
ed their very stomachs, made them sick when they
thought of it, and filled their minds with such un-
usual terror, that they were not themselves for some
weeks after. This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes
I have been speaking of, and, for a great while after,
they were tractable, and went about the common busi-
ness of the whole society well enough; planted, sowed,
reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the country.
But some time after this, they fell into such simple
measures again, as brought them into a great deal of
trouble. They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and
these three being lusty, stout young fellows, they made
them servants, and taught them to work for them; and,
as slaves, they did well enough; but they did not take
theirmeafures with them asldidby my man Friday, viz.
to begin with them upon the principle of having saved their lives, and then instruct them in the rational prin-
ciples of life; much less of religion, civilizing, and re-
ducing them by kind usage and affectionate arguings;
but as they gave them their food every day, so they
gave them their work too, and kept them fully employ-
ed in drudgery enough; but they failed in this by it,
that they never had them to assist them, and fight for . them,
them, as I had my man Friday, who was as true to me
as the very flesh upon my bones. But to come to the family part. Being all now good
friends, for common danger, as I said above, had ef-
fectually reconciled them, they began to consider their
general circumstances; and the first thing that came
under their consideration was, whether, seeing the sa-
vages particularly haunted that side of the island, and
that there were more remote and retired parts of it equal-
ly adapted to their way of living, and manifestly to
their advantage, they should not rather move their
habitation, and plant in some more proper place for
their safety, and especially for the security of their
cattle and corn. Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that
they would not remove their habitation; because that,
some time or other, they thought they might hear
from their governor again, meaning me; and if I
should send any one to seek them, I should be sure to
direct them to that side; where, if they should find the
place demolished, they would conclude the savages
had killed us all, and we were gone; and so our supply
would go too. But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to re-
move them into the valley where my cave was, where
the land was as proper for both, and where indeed
there was land enough: however, upon second thoughts,
they altered one part of their resolution too, and resolv-
ed only to remove part of their cattle thither, and plant
part of their corn there; and so if one part was destroy-
ed, the other might be saved. And one part of pru-
dence they used, which it was very well they did, viz.
that they never trusted those three savages, which they had
had prisoners, with knowing any thing of the plan-
tation they had made in that valley, or of any cattle
they had there, much less of the cave there, which they
kept, in^case of necessity, as a safe retreat; and thi-
ther they carried also the two barrels of powder which
I had sent them at my coming away.
But however they resolved not to change their habi-
tation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully covered
it first with a wall or fortification, and then with a
grove of trees, so seeing their safety consisted entirely
in their being concealed, of which they were now fully
convinced, they set to work to cover and conceal the
place yet more effectually than before. For this pur-
pose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes,
which in time all grew up to be trees, for some good
distance before the entrance into my apartments, they
went on in the same manner, and filled up the rest of
that whole space of ground, from the trees I had set,
quite down to the side of the creek, where, as I said, I
landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to
land, or any sign that there had been any landing
thereabout; these stakes also being of a wood very for-
ward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took
care to have them generally much larger and tal-
ler than those which I had planted; and as they grew
apace, so they planted them so very thick and close to-
gether, that when they had been three or four years
grown, there was no piercing with the eye any consi-
derable way into the plantation: and, as for that part
which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick as
a man's thigh, and among them they placed so many
other short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it
Vol. II. F flood
stood like a pallisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it
was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little
army to cut it all down; fora little dog could hardly
get between the trees, they stood so close. But this was not all; for they did the same by all the
ground to the right-hand and to the left, and round
even to the top of the hill, leaving no way, not so
much as for themselves to come out, but by the lad-
der placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted
up, and placed again from the first stage up to the top;
which ladder, when it was taken down, nothing but
what had wings, or witchcraft to assist it, could come
at them. This was excellently well contrived; nor was it less
than what they afterwards found occasion for; which
served to convince me, that as human prudence has
the authority of Providence to justify it, so it has
doubtless the direction of Providence to set it to work;
and if we listened carefully to the voice of it, I am
persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters
which our lives are now, by our own negligence, sub-
jected to: but this by the way. I return to the story.—They lived two years after this in perfect retirement, and had no more visits from
the savages. They had indeed an alarm given them
one morning, which put them into a great consterna-
tion; for some of the Spaniards being out early one morning on the west side, or rather end, of the island,
(which, by the way, was that end where I never went,
for fear of being discovered), they were surprised with
seeing above twenty canoes of Indians just coming on
shore. They made the best of their way home, in hurry
enough; and giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept
Robinson crusoe. 6?
kept close all that day and the next, going out only at
night to make observation: but they had the good luck
to be mistaken; for wherever the savages went, they
did not land that time on the island, but pursued some
other design. And now they had another broil with the three En-
glishmen; one of whom, a most turbulent fellow,
being in a rage at one of the three slaves, which I
mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had not
done something right which he bid him do, and seem-
ed a little untractable in his showing him, drew a hat-
chet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but
to kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, see-
ing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hat-
chet, which he aimed at his head, but struck into his
shoulders, so that he thought he had cut the poor crea-
ture's arm off, ran to him, and intreating him not to
murder the poor man, clapt in between him and the
savage, to prevent the mischief. The fellow being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would
serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which the
Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a
shovel which he had in his hand,for they were all
working in the field about their corn-land, knocked
the brute down. Another of the Englishmen running
at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the
Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards more came in
to help their man, and a third Englishman fell in upon
them. They had none of them any firearms, or any
other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except this
third Englishman; he had one of my rusty cutlasses, F a' with
with which he made at the two last Spaniards, and
wounded them both. This fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more help coming in, they took
the three Englishmen prisoners. The next question
was, what should be done with them? They had been
so often mutinous, and were so very furious, so despe-
rate, and so idle withal, they knew not what course to
take with them, for they were mischievous to the high-
est degree, and valued not what hurt they did to any
man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with
them. The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so
many words, that if they had been of his own country,
he would have hanged them; for all laws and all go-
vernors were to preserve society, and those who were
dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it;
but as they were Englishmen, and that it was to the ge-
nerous kindness of an Englishman that they all owed
their preservation and deliverance, he would use them
with all possible lenity, and would leave them to the
judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were
their countrymen. One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and
said they desired it might not be left to them; for,
says he, I am sure we ought to sentence them to the
gajlows: and with that he gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all the
five Englishmen join together, and murder all the Spa-
niards when they were in their sleep. When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to
William Atkins: How, Seignior Atkins, says he,would you murder us all? What have you to say to
that? The hardened villain was so sar from deny-
ing
ing it, that he said it was true: and, G—d d—n him,
they would do it still, before they had done with them.
Well, but Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard, what
have we done to you, that you will kill us? And what
would you get by killing us? And what must we do
to prevent your killing us? Must we kill you, or you
kill us? Why will you put us to the necessity of this,
Seignior Atkins? says the Spaniard very calmly, and
smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's
making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three
men, and withal had no weapon near him, it was
thought he would have attempted to have killed the
Spaniard in the middle of all the company. This hair-brained carriage obliged them to consider
seriously what was to be done: the two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of
the opinion that they should hang one of the three,
for an example to the rest; and that particularly it
should be he that had twice attempted to commit mur-
der with his hatchet: and indeed there was some rea-
son to believe he had done it, for the poor savage was
in such a miserable condition with the wound he had
received, that it was thought he could not live. But the governor Spaniard still said no; it was an
Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he would
never consent to put an Englishman to death, though
he had murdered half of them; nay, he said, if he had
been killed himself by an Englishman, and had time
left to speak, it should be that they should pardon him. This was so positively insisted on by the governor
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it; and as mer-
ciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where they are so F 3 earnestly
earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but then it
was to be considered what should be done to keep
them from doing the mischief they designed; for all
agreed, governor and all, that means were to be used
for preserving the society from danger. After along
debate, it was agreed, first, that they should be dis-
armed, and not permitted to have either gun, powder,
shot, sword, or any weapon; and should be turned out
of the society, and left to live where they would, and
how they would, by themselves; but that none of the
rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse with
them, speak with them, or have any thing to do with
them: that they should be forbid to come within a
certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and
if they offered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil,
burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buil-
dings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society, they
should die without mercy, and they would shoot them
wherever they could find them. The governor, a man of great humanity, musing
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it; and turn-
ing to the two honest Englishmen, said, Hold; you must
reflect that it will be long ere they can raise corn and cattle
of their own, and they must not starve; we must there-
fore allow them provisions: so he caused to be added,
that they should have a proportion of corn given them
to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time they might be supposed to raise some of
their own; that they should have six milch-goats, four
he-goats, and six kids given them, as well for present
subsistence as for a store; and that they should have
tools given them for their work in the fields, such as six
hatchets, an adze, a saw, and the like; but they should have
5
71
have none of these tools or provisions, unless they
would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or in-
jure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen. Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned
them out to shift for themselves. They went away
sullen and refractory, as neither content to go away nor to stay; but, as there was no remedy, they went, pre-
tending to go and choose a place where they would set-
tle themselves; and some provisions were given them,
but no weapons. About four or five days after, they came again for
some victuals, and gave the governor an account where
they had pitched their tents, and marked themselves
out a habitation and plantation; and it was a very con-
venient place, indeed, on the remotest part of the island,
N. E. much about the place where I providentially
landed in my first voyage, when I was driven out to
sea, the Lord alone knows whither, in my foolish at-
tempt to surround the island. Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and
contrived them in a manner like my first habitation,
being close under the side of a hill, having some trees
growing already on three sides of it, so that.by planting
others, it would be very easily covered from the sight,
unless narrowly searched for. They desired some dried
goat-skins, for. beds and covering, which were given
them; and upon giving their words that they would
not disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations,
they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they
could spare; some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing;
and, in a word, any thing they wanted, except arms and
ammunition. F 4 They
7*
ADVENTURES OF
They in this separate condition about six months, and had got in their first harvest, though
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they had
planted being but little; for, indeed, having all their
plantation to form, they had a great deal of work upon
their hands; and when they came to make boards and
pots, and such things, they were quite out of their ele-
ment, and could make nothing of it: and when the
rainy season came on, for want of a cave in the earth,
they could not keep their grain dry, and it was in great
danger of spoiling; and this humbled them much: so
they came and begged the Spaniards to help them, which
they very readily did; and in four days worked a great
hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to se-
cure their corn and other things from the rain; but
it was but a poor place, at best, compared to mine, and
especially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had great-
ly enlarged it, and made several new apartments in it. About three quarters of a year after this separation,
a new frolic took these rogues, which, together with
the former villainy they had committed, brought mis-
chief enough upon them, and had very near been the
ruin of the whole colony. The three new associates
began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they
led, and that without hope of bettering their circumstan-
ces; and a whim took them, that they would make a
voyage to the continent, from whence the savages came,
and would try if they could seize upon some prisoners
among the natives there, and bring them home, so to
make them do the laborious part of their work for
them. The project was not so preposterous, if they had
gone no farther: but they did nothing, and proposed no-
thing, thing, but had either mischief in the design, or mis-
chief in the event: and, if I may give my opinion,
they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven; for
if we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of things
with the divine justice? It was certainly an apparent
vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state they were in; and they showed not the least remorse for the crime, but
added new villanies to it, such as, particularly, the
piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave,
because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand
to do what he directed, and to wound him in such
a manner, as, no question, made him a cripple all his
life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine could
be had for his cure; and what was still worse, the mur-
derous intent, or, to do justice to the crime, the in-
tentional murder, for such to be sure it was, as was af-
terwards the formed design they all laid, to murder the
Spaniards in cold blood, and in their sleep. >
But 1 leave observing, and return to the story :—The
three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morn-
ing, and in very humble terms desired to be admitted
to speak with them: the Spaniards very readily heard
what they had to say, which was this :—That they were
tired of living in the manner they did; and that they
were not handy enough to make the necessaries they
wanted, and that having no help, they found they
should be starved; but if the Spaniards would give
them leave to take one of the canoes which they came
over in, and give them arms and ammunition propor-
tioned to their defence, they would go over to the
main and seek their fortunes, and so deliver them from the
ADVENTURES OF
the trouble of supplying them with any other provi-
sions. The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them,
but very honestly represented to them the certain de-
struction they were running into; told them they had
suffered such hardships upon that very spot, that they
could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell them they would be starved, or murdered, and bade them
consider of it. The men replied audaciously, they should be starved
if they stayed here, for they could not work, and would
not work, and they could but be starved abroad; and
if they were murdered, there was an end of them; they
had no wives or children to cry after them: and, in
short, insisted importunately upon their demand; decla-
ring that they would go, whether they would give them
any arms or no. The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that
if they were resolved to go, they should not go like na-
ked men, and be in no condition to defend themselves: and that though they could ill spare their fire-arms,
having not enough for themselves, yet they would let
them have two muskets, a pistol and cutlass, and each
man a hatchet, which they thought was sufficient for
them. In a word, they accepted the offer; and having ba-
ked them bread enough to serve them a month, and giv-
en them as much goat's-flesh as they could eat while
it was sweet, and a great basket of dried grapes, a
pot of fresh water, and a young kid alive to kill,
they boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage over the
sea, where it was at least forty miles broad. The boat indeed was a large one, and would very
well have carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was
75
was rather too big for them to manage; but as they had
a fair breeze, and flood-tide with them, they did well
enough. They had made a mast of a long pole, and a
sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and away they went merrily
nough: the Spaniards called after them, ben veyajo;
and no man ever thought of seeing them any more. The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and
to the two honest Englishmen who remained behind,
how quietly and comfortably they lived, now these
three turbulent fellows were gone; as for their coming
again, that was the remotest thing from their thoughts
that could be imagined; when, behold, after two and
twenty days absence, one of the Englishmen, being
abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange men
coming towards him at a distance, with guns upon their
shoulders. Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched,
comes frightened and amazed to the governor Spaniard,and tells him they were all undone, for there were
strangers landed upon the island, but could not tell who.
The Spaniard, pausing a while, says to him, How do
you mean,you cannot tell who? They are the savages
to be sure. No, no, says the Englishman; they are
men in clothes, with arms. Nay then, says the Spa-
niard, why are you concerned? If they are not savages,
they must be friends; for there is no Christian nation
upon earth but will do us good rather than harm. While they were debating thus, came the three En-
glishmen, and standing without the wood, which was
new planted, hollowed to them: they presently knew
their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind ceased.
But now the admiration was turned upon another ques-
ton,
ADVENTURES OF
tion, viz. What could be the matter, and what made
them come back again?It was not long before they brought the men in, and
inquiring where they had been, and what they had
been doing, they gave them a full account of their voy-
age in a few words, viz. That they reached the land in
two days, or something less; but finding the people
alarmed at their coming, and preparing with bows and
arrows to fight them, they durst not go on shore, but
sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till they
came to a great opening, by which they perceived that
the land they saw from our island was not the main,
but an island; upon entering that opening of the sea,
they saw another island on the right-hand, north, and
several more west; and being resolved to land some-
where, they put over to one of the islands which lay
west, and went boldly on shore. That they found the
people very courteous and friendly to them; and that
they gave them several roots and some dried fish, and
appeared very sociable; and the women as well as the
men, were very forward to supply them with any thing
they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them
a great way upon their heads. They continued here four days; and inquired, as
well as they could of them, by signs, what nations
were this way, and that way; and were told of several
fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way,
who, as they made known by signs to them, used to
eat men; but as for themselves, they said, they never
eat men or women, except only such as they took in
the wars; and then, they owned, they made a
great feast, and ate their prisoners. The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast
of that kind; and they told them about two moons ago, pointing
pointing to the moon, and to two singers ; andthat
theit great king had two hundred prisoners now, which
he had taken in his war, and they were feeding them to
make them fat for the next feast. The Englishmen
seemed mighty desirous of seeing those prisoners; but
the others mistaking them, thought they were desirous
to have some of them to carry away for their own eat-
ing; so they beckoned to them, pointing to the
setting of the sun, and then to the rising; which was
to signify, that the next morning at fun-rising, they,
would bring some for them; and, accordingly, the next
morning, they brought down five women and eleven
men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with
them on their voyage, just as we would bring so many
cows and oxen down to a sea-port town to victual a
ship. As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did
not know what to do. To refuse the prisoners would
have been the highest affront to the savage gentry that
could be offered them, and what to do with them they
knew not. However, upon some debates, they resolved
to accept of them; and, in return, they gave the savages
that brought them one of their hatchets, an old key,
a knife, and six or seven of their bullets; which, though
they did not understand, they seemed particularly pleas-
ed with; and then tying the poor creatures' hands be-
hind them, they (the people)dragged the prisoners into
the boat for our men. The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon
as they had them ; or else they that gave them this noble
present would certainly have expected that they should
have gone to work with them, have killed two or three of
of them the next morning, and perhaps have invited the
donors to dinner. But having taken their leave, with all
the respect and thanks that could well pass between
people, where, on either side, they understood not one
word they could say, they put off with their boat, and
came back towards the first island; where, when they
arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, there
being too many of them for their occasion. In their voyage, they endeavoured to have some com-
munication with their prisoners, but it was impossible
to make them understand any thing; nothing they could
say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was
looked upon as going to murder them. They
first of all unbound them; but the poor creatures scream-
ed at that, especially the women, as if they had just felt
the knife at their throats; for they immediately con-
cluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed. If
they gave them any thing to eat, it was the same thing;
they then concluded, it was for fear they should sink in
flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill. If they looked
at one of them more particularly, the party presently
concluded, it was to fee whether he or she was fattest, and fittest to kill first: nay, after they had brought them
quite over, and began to use them kindly, and treat
them well, still they expected every day to make a din-
ner or supper for their new masters. When the three wanderers had given this unaccount-
able history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard
asked them where their new family was; and being told
that they had brought them on shore, and put them in-
to one of their huts, and were come up to beg some
victuals for them, they (the Spaniards) and the other
two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, re-
solved solved to go all down to the place and see them; and
did so, and Friday's father with them. When they came into the hut, there they sat all
bound; for when they had brought them on shore, they
bound their hands, that they might not take the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they sat, all of them
stark naked. First, there were three men, lusty, comely
fellows, well-shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty
to thirty-five years of age; and five women, whereof
two might be from thirty to forty; two more not above
four or five arid twenty; and the fifth a tall comely
maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The women
were wellfavoured, agreeable persons, both in shape
and features, only tawny; and two of them, had they
been perfect white, would have passed for very hand-
some women, even in London itself, having pleasant agreeable countenances, and of a very modest beha-
viour; especially when they came afterwards to be
clothed and dressed, as they called it, though that dress
was very indifferent, it must be confessed; of which
hereafter. The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth
to our Spaniards, who were, to give them a just cha-
racter, men of the best behaviour, of the most calm,
sedate tempers, and perfect good-humour, that ever I
met with; and, in particular, of the most modesty, as
will presently appear: I say, the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked men and five naked women, all to-
gether bound, and in the most miserable circumstances
that human nature could be supposed to be, viz. to be
expecting every moment to be dragged out, and have
their brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up like
a calf that is killed for a dainty. The
The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian,
Friday's father, to go in, and see, first, if he knew any of
them, and then if he understood any of their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; neither could any of
them understand a word he said, or a sign he could
make, except one of the women. However, this was
enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy them
that the men into whose hands they were fallen were
Christians; that they abhorred eating men or women;
and that they might be sure they would not be kill-
ed. As soon as they were assured of this, they discover-
ed such a joy, and by such awkward gestures, several
ways, as is hard to describe; for, it seems, they were of
several nations. The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in
the next place, to ask them if they were willing to be
servants, and to work for the men who had brought
them away, to save their lives; at which they all fell a
dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this, and
another that, any thing that lay next, to carry on their
shoulders, to intimate that they were willing to work. The governor, who found that the having women
among them would presently be attended with some
inconvenience, and might occasion some strife, and per-
haps blood, asked the three men what they intended to do
with these women, and how they intended to use them,
whether as servants or as women? One of the English-
men answered very boldly and readily, that they would
use them as both; to which the governor said, I am
not going to restrain you from it; you are your own masters as to that; but this I think is but just, for avoiding
avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and I de-
sire it of you for that reason only, viz. That you
will all engage, that if any of you take any of these
women, as a woman or wife, that he shall take but one: and that having taken one, none else shall touch her;
for though we cannot marry any one of you, yet it is
but reasonable that while you stay here, the woman
any of you takes should be maintained by the man
that takes her, and should be his wife; I mean, says
he, while he continues here, and that none else shall
have any thing to do with her: AU this appeared so
just, that every one agreed to it without any difficulty. Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they
designed to take any of them? But every one answered
no: some of them said they had wives in Spain, and
the others did not like women that were not Christians: and all together declared that they would not touch
one of them: which was an instancew such virtue as I
have not met with in all my travels. On the other
hand, to be short, the five Englishmen took them
every one a wife, that is to say, a temporary wife; and
so they set up a new form of living; for the Spaniards
and Friday's father lived in my old habitation, which
they had enlarged exceedingly within. The three ser-
vants which were taken in the late battle of the savages lived with them; and these carried on the main part of
the colony, supplied all the rest with food, and assist-
ed them in any thing as they could, or as they found
necessity required. But the wonder of this story was, how five such
refractory, ill-matched fellows, should agree about these
women, and that two of them should not pitch upon
the same woman, especially seeing two or three of them Vol. II. G were
were, without comparison, more agreeable than the
others: but they took a good way enough to prevent
quarrelling among themselves; for they set the five wo-
men by themselves in one of their huts, and they went
all into the other hut, and drew lots among them who
should choose first. He that drew to chuse first, went away by himself to
the hut where the poor naked creatures were, and fetch-
ed out her he chose; and it was worth observing, that he
that chose first took her that was reckoned the home-
liest and oldest of the five, which made mirth enough
among the rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it:
but the fellow considered better than any of them, that
it was application and business they were to expect as-
sistance in, as much as any thing else; and she proved
the best wife of all the parcel. When the poor women saw themselves set in a row
thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their
condition returned upon them again, and they firmly
believed they were now going to be devoured. Accord-
ingly, when the English sailor came in and fetched out
one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry, and
hung about her, and took their leave of her with such
agonies and such affection, as would have grieved the
hardest heart in the world; nor was it possible for the
Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be
immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man,
Friday's sather, who immediately let them know that
the five men, who had fetched them out one by one,
had chosen them for their wives. When they had done, and the fright the women were
in was a little over, the men went to work, and the
Spaniards came and helped them; and in a few hours they
they had built them every one a new hut or tent for
their lodging apart: for those they had already were
crowded with their tools, household stuff, and provision.
Xhe three wicked ones had pitched farthest off, and
the two honest ones nearer, but both on the north
shore of the island, so that they continued separated as
before; and thus my island was peopled in three places;
and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be
built. And here 'tis very well worth observing, that, as it
often happens in the world (what the wise ends of
God's providence are in such a disposition of things, I
cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two worst
wives; and the three reprobates, that were scarce worth
hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed
born to do themselves good, nor any one else, had three
clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious wives; not that
the two first were bad wives, as to their temper or hu-
mour, for all the five were most willing, quiet, pas-
sive and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than
wives; but my meaning is, they were not alike capa-
ble, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and
neat. Another observation I must make, to the honour of
a diligent application, on one hand, and to the disgrace
of a slothful, negligent, idle temper, on the other, that
when I came to the place, and viewed the several im-
provements, plantings, and management of the several
little colonies, the two men had so far out-gone the
three, that there was no comparison. They had in-
deed both of them as much ground laid out for corn
as they wanted, and the reason was, because, according
to my rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to G a sow
ADVENTURES OF
sow more corn than they wanted; but the difference of
the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and in-
deed of every thing else, was easy to be seen at first
view. The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, that when you came to the place, no-
thing was to be seen but a wood: and though they had
twice had their plantation demolished, once by their
own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be
shown in its place, yet they had restored all again, and
every thing was thriving and flourishing about them : .
they had grapes planted in order, and managed like a
vineyard, though they had themselves never seen any
thing of that kind; and by their good ordering their
vines, their grapes were as good again as any of the
others. They had also found themselves out a retreat in
the thickest part of the woods; where, though there was
not a natural cave, as I had found, yet they made one
with incessant labour of their hands, and where, when
the mischief which followed happened, they secured
their wives and children, so as they could never be
found; they having, by sticking innumerable stakes and
poles of the wood which, as I said, grew so readily, made the grove unpassable, except in some places where
they climbed up to get over the outside part, and then
went on by ways of their own leaving. As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their settle-
ment compared to what they were before, and were not
so quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity; yet
one of the certain companions of a profligate mind
never left them, and that was their idleness. 'Tis true,
they planted corn, and made fences; but Solomon's words
85
words were never better verified than in them: "I
"went by the vineyard of the slothful, and it was all
overgrown with thorns;" for when the Spaniards
came to view their crop, they could Hot fee it in some
places for weeds; the hedge had several gaps in it, where
the wild goats had got in and eaten up the corn;
perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed in,
to stop them out for the present, but it was only shut-
ting the stable-door after the steed was stolen; where-
as, when they looked on the colony of the other two,
there was the very face of industry and success upon all
they did; there was not a weed to be seen in all their
corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they, on
the other hand, verified Solomon's words in another
place: "that the diligent hand maketh rich"; for every
thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty within
and without; they had more tame cattle than the
others, more utensils and necessaries within-doors, and
yet more pleasure and diversion too. It is true, the wives of the three were very handy
and cleanly within-doors, and having learned the En-
glish ways of dressing and cooking from one of the
other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's-mate
on board the ship, they dressed their husbands vic-
tuals very nicely and well; whereas the others could
not be brought to understand it; but then the husband,
who, as I say, had been cook's-mate, did it himself.
But as for the husbands of the three wives, they loitered
about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught fish and birds;
in a word, any thing but labour, and they fared ac-
cordingly. The diligent lived well and comfortably;
and the slothful lived hard and beggarly; and so, I be-
lieve, generally speaking, it is all over the world. G 3 - But
But I now come to a scene different from all that
had happened before, either to them or to me; and the
original of the story was this: Early one morning, there came on shore five or six
canoes of Indians or savages, call them which you
please, and there is no room to doubt they came upon
the old errand of feeding upon their slaves; but that
part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our
men too, that they did not concern themselves about
it, as I did: but having been made sensible, by their
experience, that their only business was to lie conceal-
ed, and that if they were not seen by any of the savages,
they would go off again quietly, when their business
was done, having, as yet, not the least notion of there
being any inhabitants in the island; I say, having
been made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but
give notice to all the three plantations to keep within-
doors, and not show themselves, only placing a scout
in a proper place, to give notice when the boats went
to sea again. This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among
the savages that there were inhabitants there; which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole
colony. After the canoes with the savages were gone
off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again; and some of
them had the curiosity to go to the place where they had
been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to their
great surprise, they found three savages left behind,
and laying fast asleep upon the ground. It was sup-
posed they had either been so gorged with their inhu-
man feast, that, like beasts, they were fallen asleep,
and would not stir when the others went, or they had wan-
wandered into the woods, and did not come back in
time to be taken in. The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spanish gover-
nor, as it happened, was with them, and his advice
was asked, but he professed he knew not what to do.
Asfor slaves, they had enough already; and as to kill-
ing them, they were none of them inclined to that:
the Spaniard governor told me, they could not think of
lhedding innocent blood; for, as to them, the poor
creatures had done them no wrong, invaded none of
their property, and they thought they had no just
quarrel against them, to take away their lives. And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, ob-
serve, that let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in
Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met
with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever, in any
foreign country, who were so universally modest, tem-
perate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so cour-
teous, as these Spaniards; and as to cruelty, they had
nothing of it in their very nature: no inhumanity, no
barbarity, no outrageous passions; and yet all of them
men of great courage and spirit. Their temper and calmness had appeared in their
bearing the insufferable usage of the three Englishmen;
and their justice and humanity appeared now in the
case of the savages, as above. After some consultation,
they resolved upon this; that they would lie still a
while longer, till, if possible, these three men might be
gone. But then the governor Spaniard recollected,
that the three savages had no boat; and if they were
left to rove about the island, they would certainly disG 4 cover .
cover that there were inhabitants in it; and so they
should be undone that way. Upon this they went back again, and there lay the
fellows fast asleep still, and so they resolved to waken
them, and take them prisoners; and they did so. The
poor fellows were strangely frightened when they were
seized upon and bound; and afraid, like the women,
that they should be murdered and eaten: for, it seems,
those people think all the world does as they do, eating
men's flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that,
and away they carried them. It was very happy for them that they did not carry
them home to their castle, I mean to my palace under
the hill; but they carried them first to the bower,
where was the chief of their country work, such as the
keeping the goats, the planting the corn, &c.; and
afterwards they carried them to the habitation of the
two Englishmen. Here they were set to work, though it was not much
they had for them to do; and whether it was by negli-
gence in guarding them, or that they thought the fel-
lows could not mend themselves, I know not, but one
of them ran away, and taking to the woods, they could
never hear of him any more. They had good reason to believe he got home again
soon after, in some other boats or canoes of savages
who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards; and
who, carrying on their revels as usual, went off in two
days time. This thought terrified them exceedingly;
for they concluded, and that not without good cause
indeed, that if this fellow came home safe among his
comrades, he would certainly give them an account
that there were people in the island, and also how few and.
and weak they were; for this savage, as I observed
before, had never been told, and it was very happy he
had not, how many there were, or where they lived; nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their
guns, much less had they shown him any of their other
retired places; such as the cave in the valley, or the
new retreat which the two Englishmen had made, and
the like. The first testimony they had that this fellow had
given intelligence of them, was, that- about two
months after this, six canoes of savages, with about
seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing
along the north side of the island, where they never
used to come before, and landed, about an hour after
sun-rise, at a convenient place, about a mile from the
habitation of the two Englishmen, where this escaped
man had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said,
had they been all there, the damage would not have
been so much, for not a man of them would have
escaped: but the case differed now very much, for two
men to fifty was too much odds. The two men had
the happiness to discover them about a league off, so
that it was above an hour before they landed; and as
they landed a mile from their huts, it was some time
before they could come at them. Now, having great
reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first thing
they did was to bind the two slaves which were left,
and cause two of the three men whom they brought
with the women, who, it seems, proved very faithful to them) to lead them, with their two wives, and
whatever they could carry away with them, to their re-
tired places in the woods, which I have spoken of above,"
above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot,
till they heard sarther.
In the next place, seeing the savages were all come
on shore, and that they had bent their course directly
that way, they opened the fences where the milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out; leaving their
goats to straggle in the woods, whither they pleased,
that the savages might think they were all bred wild; but the rogue who came with them was too cunning
for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they
went directly to place. When the two poor frightened men had secured
their wives and goods, they sent the other slave they
had of the three who came with the women, and
who was at their place by accident, away to the Spa-
niards with all speed, to give them the alarm, and de-
sire speedy help; and, in the mean time, they took
their arms, and what ammunition they had, and re-
treated towards the place in the wood where their wives
were sent; keeping at a distance, yet so that they might
see, if possible, which way the savages took. They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground they could see the little army of their enemies come on
directly to their habitation, and, in a moment more,
could see all their huts and houfhold-stuff flaming up
together, to their great grief and mortification; for
they had a very great loss, to them irretrievable, at
least for some time. They kept their station for a
while, till they found the savages, like wild beasts,
spread themselves all over the place, rummaging every
way, and every place they could think of, in search
of prey; and in particular for the people, of whom, now, it plainly appeared, they had intelligence. The
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking them-
selves not secure where they stood, because it was like-
ly some of the wild people might come that way, and they might come too many together, thought it pro-
per to make another retreat about half a mile sarther;
believing, as it afterwards happened, that the farther they strolled, the fewer would be together. Their next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a
tree stood, which was hollow and vastly large; and in
this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see there what might offer. They had not stood there long, before two of the sa-
vages appeared running directly that way, as if they
already had notice where they stood, and were
coming up to attack them; and a little way farther they espied three more coming after them, and five
more beyond them, all coming the same way: besides
which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance, run-
ning another way; for, in a word, they ran every way,
like sportsmen beating for their game,
i The poor men were now in great perplexity whe-
ther they should stand and keep their posture, or fly;
but, after a very short debate with themselves, they
considered, that if the savages ranged the country thus before help came, they might perhaps find out their re-
treat in the woods, and then all would be lost; so they
resolved to stand them there; and if they were too many
to deal with, then they would get up to the top of the
tree, from whence they doubted not to defend them-
selves, fire excepted, as long as their ammunition last-
ed, though all the savages that were landed, which
was near fifty, were to attack them. 5 Having
Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait for the
three, and so take the middle party, by which the two
and the five that followed would be separated; at length
they resolved to let the two first pass by, unless they
should spy them in the tree, and come to attack them.
The two first savages confirmed them also in this regu-
lation, by turning a little from them towards another
part of the wood; but the three, and the five after them,
came forward directly to the tree, as if they had known
the Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so straight toward them, they re-
solved to take them in a line as they came; and as
they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first
shot might hit them all three; to which purpose, the
man who was to fire put three or four small bullets into
his piece; and having a fair loop-hole, as it were,
from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim,
without being seen, waiting till they were within about
thirty yards of the tree, so that he could not miss. While they were thus waiting, and the savages came
on, they plainly saw that one of the three was the run-
away savage that had escaped from them; and they
both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, if possi-
ble, he should not escape, though they should both
fire; so the other stood ready with his piece, that if he
did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to
have a second. But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
aim; for as the savages kept near one another, a little
behind, in a line, in a word,he fired, and hit two of
them directly: the foremost was killed outright, being
shot in the head; the second, which was the runa-
way
way Indian, was shot through the body, and fell, but
was not quite dead; and the third had a little scratch
in the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that went
through the body of the secondhand being dreadfully
frightened, though not so much hurt, sat down upon
the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner. The five that were behind, more frightened with
the noise than sensible of the danger, stood still at first;
for the woods made the sound a thousand times bigger
than it really was, the echoes rattling from one side to
another, and the fowls rising from all parts, screaming
and making, every sort, a several kind of noise, ac-
cording to their kind; just as it was when I fired the
first gun that perhaps was ever shot off in that place,
since it was an island,
However, all being silent again, and they not know-
ing what the matter was, came on unconcerned, till
they came to the place where their companions lay, in
a condition miserable enough; and here the poor igno-
rant creatures, not sensible that they were within reach
of the same mischief, stood all of a huddle over the
wounded man, talking, and, as may be supposed, in-
quiring of him how he came to be hurt; and who, it
is very rational to believe, told them, that a flash of
fire first, and immediately after that thunder from
their gods, had killed those two and wounded him.
This, I say, is rational; for nothing is more.certain
than that, as they saw no man near them, so they had
never heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much as
heard of a gun; neither knew they any thing of kil-
ling and wounding at a distance with fire and bullets: if they had, one might reasonably believe they would
not have stood so unconcerned in viewing the fate of their
their fellows, without some apprehensions of their
own. Our two men, though, as'they confessed to me, it
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor crea-
tures, who, at the same time, had no notion of their
danger; yet, having them all thus in their power, and
the first having loaded his piece again, resolved to let
fly both together among them; and singling out, by
agreement, which to aim at, they shot together, and
killed, or very much wounded, four of them; the fifth,
frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with
the rest; so that our men seeing them all fall together,
thought they had killed them all. The belief that the savages were all killed made our
two men come boldly out from the tree before they
had charged their guns, which was a wrong step; and
they were under some surprise when they came to the
place, and found no less than four of them alive, and of
them two very little hurt, and one not at all: this
obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks of their
muskets; and first they made sure of the runaway sa-
vage, that had been the cause of all the mischief, and of
another that was hurt in the knee, and put them out of
their pain: then the man that was not hurt at all came
and kneeled down to them, with his two hands held
up, and made piteous moans to them, by gestures and
signs, for his life, but could not say one word to them
that they could understand. However, they signed to him to sit down at the foot
of a tree hard by; and one of the Englishmen, with a
piece of rope-twine, which he had by great chance in
his pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there
they left him: and with what speed they could made after
after the other two, which were gone before, fearing
they, or any more of them, should find the way to
their covered place in the woods, where their wives,
and the few goods they had left, lay. They came once
in sight of the two men, but it was at a great distance;
however, they had the satisfaction to fee them cross
over a valley towards the sea, the quite contrary way
from that which led to their retreat, which they were
afraid of; and being satisfied with that, they went back
to the tree where they left their prisoner, who, as
they supposed, was delivered by his comrades, for he
was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which
they had bound him, lay just at the foot of the tree. They were now in as great concern as before, not
knowing what course to take, or how near the enemy
might be, or in what numbers; so they resolved to go
away to the place where their wives were, to see if all
was well there, and to make them easy, who were in
fright enough to be sure; for though the savages were
their own country-folk, yet they were most terribly
afraid of them, and perhaps the more for the know-
ledge they had of them. When they came there, they found the savages had
been in the wood, and very near that place, but had
not found it: for it was indeed inaccessible, by the trees
standing so thick, as before, unless the persons seeking
it had been directed by those that knew it, which these
did not: they found therefore every thing very safe,
only the women in a terrible fright. While they were
here, they had the comfort to have seven of the Spa-
niards come to their assistance; the other ten, with
their servants, and old Friday, I mean Friday's sather,
were gone in a body to defend their bower, and the corn
corn and cattle that was kept there, in case the savages
should have roved over to that side of the country; but
they did not spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the three savages who, as I said, weretheit
prisoners formerly: and with them also came the sa-
vage whom the Englishmen had left bound hand and
foot at the tree; for, it seems, they came that way, saw
the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth,
and brought him along with them; where, however,
they were obliged to bind him again, as they had the
two others who were left when the third ran away. The prisoners began to be a burthen to them;
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they were
once resolving to kill them all, believing they were un-
der an absolute necessity to do so, for their own preser-
vation. However, the Spaniard governor would not
consent to it; but ordered, for the present, that they
should be sent out of the way, to my old cave in the
valley, and be kept there, with two Spaniards to guard
them, and give them food for their subsistence, which
was done; and they were bound there hand and foot
for that night. When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were
so encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves
to stay any longer there; but taking five of the Spa-
niards and themselves, with four muskets and a pis-
tol among them, and two stout quarter-staves, away
they went in quest of the savages. And first they came
to the tree where the men lay that had been killed; but
it was easy to see that some more of the savages had
been there, for they had attempted to carry their dead
men away, and had dragged two of them a good way,
but had given it over. From thence they advanced to the
the first rising ground, where they had stood and seen
their camp destroyed, and where they had the mortifi-
cation still to see some of the smoak; but neither could they here see any of the savages. They then resolved,
though with all possible caution, to go forward, towards
their ruined plantation; but a little before they came
thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, they saw
plainly the savages all embarked again in their canoes, in
order to be gone. They seemed sorry, at first, that there was no way to
come at them, to give them a parting blow; but, upon
the whole, they were very well satisfied to be rid of
them. The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and
all their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to
come and help them to rebuild, and to assist them with
needful supplies. Their three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least inclination to do any
good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they living
remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all
was over), came and offered their help and assistance,
and did, very friendly, work for several days, to restore
their habitation, and make necessaries for them. And
thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legs
again. About two days after this j they had the sarther sa-
tissaction of seeing three of the savages canoes come
driving on shore, and, at some distance from them, two
drowned men: by which they had reason to believe
that they had met with a storm at sea, which had overset
some of them; for it had blown very hard the night
after they went off.
Vol. II H However,
However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other
hand, enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as
well of what they had done as of what had happened to
them, and to whet them on to another enterprise of the
same nature; which they, it seems, resolved to attempt,
with sufficient force to carry all before them: for ex-
cept what the first man had told them of inhabitants,
they could say little of it of their own knowledge, for
they never saw one man; and the fellow being killed
that had affirmed it, they had no other witness to con-
firm it to them. It was five or six months after this before they heard
anymore of the savages, in which time our men were
in hopes they had either forgot their former bad luck,
or given over hopes of better; when, on a sudden, they
were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less
thati eight and twenty canoes, full of savages, armed
with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords,
and such-like engines of war; and they brought such
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our peo-
ple into the utmost consternation. As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
castermost side of the island, our men had that night
to consult and consider what to do; and, in the first
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed was
their only safety before, and would be much more so
now, while the number of their enemies was so great, they therefore resolved, first of all, to take down the
huts which were built for the two Englishmen, and
drive away their goats to the old cave; because they
supposed the savages would go directly thither, as
soon as it was day, to play the old game over again, though
though they did not now land within two leagues
of it. In the next place, they drove away all the flock of
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which
belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as little
appearance of inhabitants any where as was possible: and the next morning early they posted themselves,
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men,
to wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it hap-
pened: these new invaders leaving their canoes at the
east end of the island, came ranging along the shore,
directly towards the place, to the number of two hun-
dred and fifty, as near as our men could judge. Our
army was but small, indeed; but that which was worse,
they had not arms for all their number neither. The
whole account, it seems, stood thus: first, as to men:
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old Friday, or Friday's sather.
3 The three slaves taken with the women, who proved very saithful.
3 other slaves, who lived with the Spaniards. To arm these, they had
11 Muskets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling-pieces.
5 Muskets or fowling-pieces which were taken
by me from the mutinous seamen whom I
reduced,
a Swords, three old halberds. To their slaves they did not give either musket or
fusee, but they had every one a halberd, or a long staff,
like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron fastened H a into
ADVENTURES OF
into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also
every one of our men had hatchets. Two of the wo-
men could not be prevailed upon but they would come
into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, which
the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the
first action happened, which I have spoken of, where
the Indians fought with one another; and the women
had hatchets too. The Spaniard governor, whom I described so often,
commanded the whole; and Will Atkins, who, though
a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a most daring,
bold fellow, commanded under him. The savages
came forward like lions; and our men, which was the
worst of their fate, had no advantage in their situation;
only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful
fellow, with six men, was planted just behind a small
thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to
let the first of them pass by, and then fire into the
middle of them, and as soon as he had fired, to make
his retreat as nimble as he could round a part of the
wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards, where they
stood, having a thicket of trees before them. When the savages came on, they ran straggling
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of order,
and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him;
then seeing the rest come in a very thick throng,
he orders three of his men to fire, having loaded their
muikets.with six or seven bullets a-piece, abput as big
as large pistol-bullets. How many they killed or
wounded they knew not, but the consternation and sur-
prise was inexpressible among the savages; they were
frightened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful
noise, and see their men killed, and others hurt, but see no-
S
nobody that did it; when, in the middle of their fright,
Will Atkins and his other three let fly again among
the thickest of them; and in less than a minute the first
three being loaded again, gave them a third volley. Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately,
as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of the body been at hand, to have pour-
ed in their shot continually, the savages had been effec-
tually routed; for the terror that was among them came
principally from this, viz. that they were killed by
the gods with thunder and lightning, and could see no-
body that hurt them; but Will. Atkins staying to load
again, discovered the cheat; some of the savages who
were at a distance spying them, came upon them be-
hind; and though Atkins and his men fired at them al-
so, two or three times, and killed above twenty, reti-
ring as fast as they could, yet they wounded Atkins
himself, and killed one of his fellow Englishmen with
their arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and
one of the Indian slaves who came with the women.
This slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought most
desperately, killing five of them with his own hand,
having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a
hatchet. Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded,
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground
in the wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three vol-
lies upon them, retreated also; for their number was so
great, and they were so desperate, that though above
fifty of them were killed, and more than as many
wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our men,
fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud;
and it was observed that their wounded men, who
H 3 were
were not quite disabled, were made outrageous by their
wounds, and fought like madmen.
When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and
the Englishman that was killed behind them; and the
savages when they came up to them, killed them over
again in a wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs,
and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords, like
true savages; but sinding our men were gone, they did
not seem to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a
ring, which is, it seems, their custom, and shouted
twice, in token of their victory: after which, they had
the mortification to see several of their wounded men
sall, dying with the mere loss of blood.
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body
up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he
was wounded, would have had them march and charge x
again altogether at once : but the Spaniard replied, Seig-
nior Atkins, you fee how theirwounded men fight, let
them alone till morning; all the wounded men will be
stiff and fore with their wounds, and saint with the
loss of blood ; and so we shall have the fewer to engage.
This advice was good; but Will. Atkins replied mer-
rily, That is true, seignior, and so shall I too ; and that
is the reason I would go on while I am warm. Well,
Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard, you have be-
haved gallantly, and done your part; we will fight
for you, if you cannot come on; but I think it best to
stay till morning: so they waited.
But as it was a clear moon-light night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their dead and
wounded risen, and a great noise and hurry among
them where they lay, they aftewards resolved to sall
upon them in the night; especially, if they could come
to
to give them but one volley before they were discovered,
which they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of the
Englishmen, in whose quarter it was where the
fight began, led them round between the woods and
the sea-side westward, and then turning short south,
they came so near where the thickest of them lay, that, before they were seen or heard, eight of them fired in
among them, and did dreadful execution upon them;
in half a minute more, eight others fired after them,
pouring in their small shot in such a quantity, that
abundance were killed and wounded; and all this while
they were not able to see who hurt them, or which way
to fly.
The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expe-
dition, and then divided themselves in three bodies,
and resolved to fall in among them altogether. They
had in each body eight persons, that is to say, twenty-
two men, and the two women, who, by the way,
fought desperately. They divided the fire-arms equally in each party,
and so the halberds and staves. They would have had
the women kept back, but they said they were resolved
to die with their husbands. Having thus formed their
little army, they marched out from among the trees,
and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and
hollaing as loud as they could: the savages stood all to-
gether, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the
noise of our men shouting from three quarters toge-
ther: they would have fought if they had seen us; for
as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows
were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though
not dangerously; but our men gave them no time, but, running up to them, fired among them three ways, and H 4 then
then fell in with the butt-ends of their muskets,
their swords, armed staves, and hatchets, and laid about
them so well, that, in a word, they set up a dismal
screaming and howling, flying to save their lives which
way soever they could. Our men were tired with the execution, and killed
or mortally wounded in the two fights about 180 of
them; the rest, being frightened out oftheir wits, scour-
ed through the woods and over the hills, with all the
speed fear and nimble feet could help them to do; and as
we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they
got all together to the sea-side where they landed, and
where their canoes lay: but their disaster was not at an
end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that even-
ing from the sea, so that it was impossible for them to go off; nay, the storm continuing all night,
when the tide came up, their canoes were most of them
driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore,
that it required infinite toil to get them off; and some of
them were even dashed to pieces against the beach, or
against one another. Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got lit-
tle rest that night; but having refreshed themselves as
well as they could, they resolved to march to that part
of the island where the savages were fled, and see what
posture they were in. This necessarily led them over
the place where the fight had been, and where they
found several of the poor creatures not quite dead, and
yet past recovering life ; a'sight disagreeable enough to
generous minds; for a truly great man, though oblig-
ed by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no
delight in his misery. {iowever,
However, there was no need to give any orders in this case; for their own savages, who were their ser-
vants, dispatched these poor creatures with their
hatchets. At length, they came in view of the place where the
more miserable remains of the savages army lay, where
there appeared about a hundred still: their posture was
generally sitting upon the ground, with their knees up
towards their mouth, and the head put between the
two hands, leaning down upon the knees. When our men came within two musket-shots ofthem, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be
fired, without ball, to alarm them: this he did, that by
their countenance he might know what to expect, viz.
whether they were still in heart to right, or were so
heartily beaten as to be dispirited and discouraged, and
so he might manage accordingly. This stratagem took; for as soon as the savages heard
the first gun and saw the flash of the second, they start-
ed up upon their feet in the greatest consternation ima-
ginable: and as our men advanced swiftly towards them,
they all ran screaming and yelling away, with a kind
of howling noise, which our men did not understand,
and had never heard before; and thus they ran up the
hills into the country. At first our men had much rather the weather had
been calm, and they had all gone away to sea; but they
did not then consider that this might probably have
been the occasion of their coming again in such multi-
tudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so ma-
ny, and so often, as would quite desolate the island, and
starve them. Will. Atkins therefore, who, notwith-
standing his wound, kept.always wjth them, proved the best
best counsellor in this case: his advice was to take the
advantage that offered, and clap in between them and
their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever
returning any more to plague the island. They consulted long about this; and some were against
it, for fear of making the wretches fly to the woods and
live there desperate, and so they should have them to
hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their
business, and have their plantation continually rifled, all
their tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced
to a life of continual distress.
Will. Atkins told them they had better have to do
with a hundred men than with a hundred nations:
that as they must destroy their boats, so they must de-
stroy the men, or be all of them destroyed them-
selves. In a word, he showed them the necessity of it
so plainly, that they all came into it; so they went to
work immediately with the boats, and getting some dry
wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set some
of them on fire, but they were'so wet that they would
not burn; however, the fire so burned the upper part,
that it soon made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw what they were about,
some of them came running out of the woods, and com-
ing as near as they could to our men, kneeled down
and cried, "Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and some other words
of their language, which none of the others understood
any thing of; but as they made pitiful gestures and
strange noises, it was easy to understand they begged to
have their boats spared, and that they would be gone,
and never come there again. But our men were now satisfied that they had no way
to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, but effec-
tually tually to prevent any of these people from ever going
home again: depending upon this, that if even so much
as one of them got back into their country to tell the
story, the colony was undone; so that, letting them
know that they should not have any mercy, they fell
to work with their canoes, and destroyed them every
one that the storm had not destroyed before; at the
sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry in the
woods, which our people heard plain enough, after
which they ran about the island like distracted men; so
that, in a word, our men did not really know at first
what to do with them. Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, con-
sider, that while they made those people thus desperate,
they ought to have kept a good guard at the same time
upon their plantations; for though it is true, they had
driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find
out their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill,
nor the cave in the valley, yet they found out my
plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and
all the fences and planting about it; trod all the corn
underfoot, tore up the vines and grapes, being just then
almost ripe, and did our men an inestimable damage,
though to themselves not one farthing's worth of service. Though our men were able to fight them upon all
occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down; for as they were too nim-
ble of foot for our men, when they found them single,
so our metvdurst not go abroad single, sopiear of being
surrounded with their numbers. The best was, they
had no weapons; for though they had bows, they had
no arrows left, nor any materials to make any 5 nor
had they any edged tool or weapon among them. The
ADVENTURES OF
The extremity and distress they were reduced to was
great and indeed deplorable; but at the same time,
our men were also brought to very bad circumstances by
them; for though their retreats were preserved, yet
their provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled;
and what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they
knew not. The only refuge they had now was the stock
of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some
little corn which grew there, and the plantation of the
three Englishmen, Will Atkins and his comrades, who
were now reduced to two; one of them being killed by
an arrow, which struck him on the side of his head,
just under the temples, so that he never spoke more: and it was very remarkable, that this was the same
barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage slave with his
hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have murder-
ed the Spaniards. I looked upon their case to have been worse at this
time than mine was at any time, after I first discovered
the grains of barley and rice, and got into the manner
of planting and raising my corn, and my tame cattle;
for now they had, as I may fay, an hundred wolves upon
the island, which would devour every thing they could come at, yet could be hardly come at themselves.
The first tiling they concluded, when they saw what
their circumstances were, was, that they would, if pos-
sible, drive them up to the farther part of the island,
south-west, that if any more savages came on shore they might not find one another: then that they would
daily hunt and harass them, and kill as many of them
as they could come at, till they had reduced their num-
ber; and if they could at last tame them, and bring them.
/
them to any thing, they would give them corn, and
teach them how to plant, and live upon their daily labour. In order to this, they so followed them, and so terri-
fied them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of
them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him,
yet he would fall down for fear; and so dreadfully
frightened they were, that they kept out of fight sar-
ther and sarther; till a last, our men following them,
and every day killing or wounding some of them,
they kept up in the woods or hollow places so much,
that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of
food; and many were afterwards found dead in the
woods, without any hurt, but merely starved to death. When our men found this, it made their hearts re-
lent, and pity moved them, especially the Spaniard go-
vernor, who was the most gentlemanly, generous mind-
ed man, that ever I met with in my life; and he pro-
posed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and bring
him to understand what they meant, so far as to be
able to act as interpreter, and go among them, and see if they might be brought to some conditions that might
be depended upon, to save their lives and do us no harm. It was some while before any of them could be ta-
ken; but beingweak and half-starved, one of them was
at last surprised and made a prisoner. He was sullen at
first, and would neither eat nor drink; but finding himself
kindly used, and victuals given him, and no violence
offered him, he at last grew tractable, and came to
himself. They brought old Friday to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the others would be
to them all; that they would not only save their lives,
but would give them part of the island to live in, pro-
vided vided they would give satisfaction that they would keep
in their'owu bounds, and not come beyond it to injure
or prejudice others; and that they should have corn
given them to plant and make it grow for their bread,
and some bread given them for their present subsistence:
and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the
rest of his countrymen, and see what they said to it;
assuring them, that if they did not agree immediately,
they should be all destroyed. The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and redu-
ced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at
the first offer, and begged to have some food given
them; upon which, twelve Spaniards and two English-
men, well armed, with three Indian slaves and old Fri-
day, marched to the place where they were. The three
Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of bread,
some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live goats; and they were ordered to go to the
side of a hill, where they sat down, ate their provisions
very thankfully, and were the most faithful fellows to
their words that could be thought of; for, except when
they came to beg victuals and directions, they never
came out of their bounds: and there they lived when
I came to the island, and I went to see them. They had taught them both to plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them: they wanted
nothing but wives, and they soon would have been a
nation. They were confined to a neck of land, surround-
ed with high rocksbehindthem, and lying plain towards
the sea before them, on the south-east corner of the
island. They had land enough, and it was very good and
and fruitful:—They had a piece of land about a mile
and half broad, and three or four miles in length. Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made for myself, and gave among them twelve hatch-
ets and three or four knives; and there they lived, the
most subjected innocent creatures that ever were
heard of. After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity
with respect to the savages till I came to revisit them,
which was about two years after; not but that, now and
then, some canoes of savages came on shore for their tri-
umphal, unnatural feasts; but as they were of several na-
tions, and perhaps had never heard of those that came
before, or the reason of it, they did not make any search
or inquiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it
would have been very hard to have found them out. Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that
happened to them, to my return, at least, that was worth notice. The Indians or savages were wonderfully civi-
lized by them, and they frequently went among them;
but forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Indians
coming to them, because they would not have their
settlement betrayed again. One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they taught
the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but they
soon outdid their masters; for they made abundance
of most ingenious things in wicker-work, particularly
all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cup-boards, Sec.
as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abun-
dance of others things; being very ingenious at such work, when they were once put in the way of it. My coming was a particular relief to these people,
because we furnished them with knives, scissars, spades, shovels,
shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which
they could want. With the help of those tools they were so very han-
dy, that they came at last to build up their huts, or
houses, very handsomely, raddling or working it up like
basket-work all the way round; which was a very extra-
ordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but
was an exceeding good fence, as well against heat as
against all sorts of vermin; and our men were so taken
with it, that they got the wild savages to come and do
the like for them; so that when I came to see the two
Englishmen's colonies, they looked, at a distance, as
if they all like bees in a hive; and as for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, ne-
cessary and sober fellow, he had made himself such a
tent of basket-work, as, I believe, was never seen; it was 120 paces round on the outside, as I mea-
sured by my steps; the walls were as close worked as
a basket, in pannels or squares of thirty-two in num-
ber, and very strong, standing about seven feet high: in the middle was another not above twenty-two paces
round, but built stronger, being octagon in its form,
and in the eight corners stood eight very strong posts;
round the top of which he laid strong pieces, pinned to-
gether with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyra-
mid for a roof of eight rafters, very handsome, I assure
you, and joined together very well, though he had no
nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he made him-
self too, out of the old iron that I had left there; and
indeed this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity in se-
veral things which he had no knowledge of: he made
him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the
fire; he made himself charcoal for his work; and hd
.formed out of the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer
113
hanlmer upon: in this manner he made many things,
but especially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hin-
ges. But to return to the house: After he had pitched
the roof of his innermost tent, he worked it up between
the rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched that
over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and over that
a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his
house was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. In-
deed, he owned that the savages had made the basket-
work for him. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, all round
this inner apartment, and long rafters layfrom the
thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house,
being about twenty feet distant; so that there was a space
like a walk within the outer wicker-wall, and without
the inner, near twenty feet wide. The inner place he partitioned off with the same wick-
er-work, but much fairer, and divided into six apart-
ments, so that he had six rooms on a floor, and out of
every one of these there was a door; first into the entry, or coming into the main tent, and another door into the
main tent, and another door into thespace or walk that
was round it; so that walk was also divided into six equal
parts, which served not only for a retreat, but to store
up any necessaries which the family had occasion for:
these six spaces not taking up the whole circumference,
what other apartments the outer circle had were thus
ordered:—As soon as you were in at the door of the out-
er circle, you had a short passage strait before you to the
door c fthe inner house; but on either side was a wick-
er partition, and a door in it, by which you went first
into a large room, or store-house, twenty feet wide, and
about thirty feet long, and through that into another.
Vol. II. 1 not
not quite so long; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come at
through the apartments of the inner tent, and served as
closets or retiring rooms to the respective chambers of
the inner circle, and four large warehouses, or barns,
or what you please to call them, which went through
one another, two on either hand of the passage, that
led through the outer door to the inner tent. Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen
in the world, nor a house or tent so neatly contrived,
much less so built. In this great bee-hive lived the
three families, that is to say, Will Atkins and his com-
panion; the third was killed, but his wife remained, with
three children, for she was, it seems, big with child when
he died: and the other two were not at all backward to
give the widow her full share of every thing, I mean
as to their corn, milk, grapes, &c. and when they kil-
led a kid, or found a turtle on the shore; so that they
all lived well enough; though it was true, they were not
so industrious as the other two, as has been observed
already. One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. thatas for religion, I do not know that there was any thing
of that kind among them: they often, indeed, put one
another in mind thatthere was a God, by the very com-
mon method of seamen, viz. swearing by his name:
nor were their poor ignorant savage wives much better
for having been married to Christians, as we must call
them; for as they knew very little of God themselves,
so they were utterly incapable of entering into any dis-
course with their wives about a God, or to talk any
thing to them concerning religion. The
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say
the wives had made from them was, that they had taught
them to speak English pretty well; and most of their
Children, which were near twenty in all, were taught
to speak English too, from their first learning to speak,
though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner,
like their mothers. There was none of these children above six years old when I came thither, for it was not
much above seven years that they had fetched these five
savage ladies over; but they had all been pretty fruit-
ful, for they had all children, more or less i I
think the cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth child;
and the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed,
quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to
one another, mighty observant and subject to their mas-
ters,I cannot call them husbands), and wanted nothing
but to be well instructed in the Christian religion, and
to be legally married; both which were happily brought
about afterwards by my means, or, at least, in conse-
quence of my coming among them. Having thus given an account of the colony in ge-
neral, and pretty much of my runagate English, I
must say something of the Spaniards, who were the
main body of the family, and in whose story there are
some incidents also remarkable enough. I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances when they were among the savages.
They told me readily that they had no instances to
give of their application or ingenuity in that country; that they were a poor, miserable, dejected handful of
people; that if means had been put into their hands,
yet so abandoned themselves to despair, and so sunk
under the weight of their misfortune, that they thought I 2 '&£
ADVENTURES OF
of nothing but starving. One of them, a grave and
sensible man, told me he was convinced they were in
the wrong; that it was not the part of wise men to give
themselves up to their misery, but always to take hold
of the helps which reason offered, as well for present
support as for future deliverance: he told me that grief
was the most senseless insignificant passion in the world,
for that it regarded only things past, which were gene-
rally impossible to be recalled, or to be remedied, but
had no views of things to come, and had no share in any
thing that looked like deliverance, but rather added to
the affliction than proposed a remedy; and upon this
he repeated a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot
repeat in just the same words that he spoke it in, yet I
remember I made it into an English proverb of my
own, thus:
In trouble to be troubled, Is to have your trouble doubled. He ran on then in remarks upon all the little im-
provements I had made in my solitude; my unwearied
application, as he called it; and how I had made a con-
dition which in its circumstances was at first much
worse than theirs, a thousand times more happy than
theirs was, even now when they were all together.
He told me it was remarkable that Englishmen had a
greater presence of mind, in their distress, than any
people that ever he met with: that their unhappy na-
tion and the Portuguese were the worst men in the
world to struggle with misfortunes; for that their first
step in dangers, after the common efforts were over,
was to despair, lie down under it, and die, without
rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape. I told
I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly;
that they were cast upon the shore without necessaries,
without supply of food, or present sustenance till they
could provide: that it was true, I had this disadvantage
and discomfort, that I was alone; but then the supplies
I had providentially thrown into my hands, by the un-
expected driving of the ship on shore, was such a help
as would have encouraged any creature in the world to
have applied himself as I had done. Seignior, says the
Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we
should never have got half those things out of the
ship, as you did: Nay, says he, we should never have
found means to have got a raft to carry them, or to
have got the raft on shore without boat or sail: and
how much less should we have done, said he, if any of
us had been alone? Well, I desired him to abate his
compliment, and go on with the history of their com-
ing on shore, where they landed. He told me they un-
happily landed at a place where there were people with-
out provisions; whereas, had they had the common-
fense to have put off to sea again, and gone to another
island a little farther, they had found provisions, though
without people; there being an island that way, as
they had been told, where there were provisions, though
no people; that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trini-
dad had frequently been there, and had filled the island
with goats and hogs at several times, where they had bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and sea-fowls
were in such plenty, that they could have been in no
want of flesh, though they had found no bread; where-
as here, they were only sustained with a few roots and
herbs, which they understood not, and which had no
substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave them I 3 sparingly
sparingly enough; and who could treat them no better,
unless they would turn cannibals, and eat men's flesh,
which was the great dainty of their country. They gave me an account how many ways they strove
to civilize the savages they were with, and to teach them
rational customs in the ordinary way of living, but in
vain; and how they retorted it upon them, as unjust,
that they, who came there for assistance and support,
should attempt to set up for instructors of those that
gave them food; intimating, it seems, that none should
set up for the instructors of others but those who could
live without them. They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they
were driven to , how sometimes they were many days
without any food at all, the island they were upon
being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more
indolent, and for that reason were less supplied with
the necessaries of life, than they had reason to believe
others were in the same part of the world: and yet they
found that these savages were less ravenous and vora-
cious than those who had better supplies of food. Also they added,. that they could not but see with
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the go-
verning providence of God directs the events of things in
the world; which, they said, appeared in their circum-i
stances: for if, pressed by the hardships they were under,
and the barrenness of the country where they were,
they had searched after a better to live in, they had then
been out of the way of the relief that happened to them
by my means. They then gave me an account how the savages
whom they lived among expected them to go out with
them into their wars: and it was true, that as they had : fire-arm.s
fire-arms With them, had they not the disaster to lose
their ammunition, they should have been serviceable
not only to their friends, but have made themselves ter-
rible both to friends and enemies; but being without
powder and shot, and yet in a condition that they
could not in reason deny to go out with their landlords
to their wars, so' when they came into the field of bat-
tle, they were in a worse condition than the savages
themselves; for they had neither bows nor arrows, nor
could they use those the savages gave them; so they
could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded with
arrows, till they came up to the teeth of their ene-
my; and then indeed the three halberds they had were
of use to them; and they would often drive a whole
little army before them with those halberds, and shar-
pened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets: but
that, for all this, they were sometimes surrounded with
multitudes, and in great danger from their arrows, till at last they found the way to make themselves large tar-
gets of wood, which they covered with skins of wild
beasts, whose names they knew not, and these covered
them from the arrows of the savages: that, notwith-
standing these, they were sometimes in great danger,
were once five of them knocked down together with
the clubs of the savages, which was the time when one
of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard
whom I had relieved: that at first they thought he had
been killed; but when they afterwards heard he was
taken prisoner, they were under the greatest grief ima-
ginable, and would willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued him. They told me that when they were so knocked
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and I 4 stood

stood over them, fighting till they were come to them-
selves, all but him whom they thought had been dead;
and then they made their way with their halberds and
pieces, standing close together in a line, through a bo-
dy of above a thousand savages, beating down all that
came in their way, got the victory over their enemies,
but to their great sorrow, because it was with the loss
of their friend; whom the other party, sinding him
alive, carried ofF, with some others, as I gave an ac-
count in my former.
They described most affectionately, how they were
surprized with joy at the return of their friend and com-
panion in misery, who, they thought, had been de-
voured by wild beasts of the worst kind, viz. by wild
men; and yet how more and more they were surprized
with the account he gave them of his errand, and that
there was a Christian in any place near, much more
one that was able and had humanity enough to contri-
bute to their deliverance,
They described, how they were astonished at the
fight of the relief I sent them, and at the appearance of
loaves of bread, things they had not seen since their
coming to that miserable place: how often they cros-
sed and blessed it as bread sent from Heaven; and what
a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it, as al-
so of the other things I had sent for their supply: and
after all, they would have told me something of the joy
they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots, to carry
them away to the person and place from whence all
these new comforts came; but they told me it was im-
possible to express it by words, for their excessive joy
naturally driving them to unbecoming extravagancies,
they had no way to describe them, but by telling me
they
they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent
to their passions suitable to the sense that was upon them;
that in some it worked one way, and in some another;
and that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would
burst into tears, others be stark mad, and others imme-
diately faint. This discourse extremely affected me,
and called to my mind Friday's ecstasy when he met
his father, and the poor people's ecstasy when I took
them up at sea after their ship was on fire; the mate of
the ship's joy when he found himself delivered in the
place where he expected to perish; and my own joy,
when, after twenty-eight years captivity I found a good
ship ready to carry me to my own country. All these
things made me more sensible of the relation of these
poor men, and more affected with it. Having thus given a view of the state of things as I
found them, I must relate the heads of what I did for
these people, and the condition in which I left them.
It was their opinion, and mine too, that they would be
troubled no more with the savages, or, if they were,
they would be able to cut them off, if they were twice
as many as before; so they had no concern about that.
Then I entered into a serious discourse with the Spani-
ard, whom I call governor, about their stay in the
island; for as I was not come to carry any of them off, so
it would not be just to carry off some and leave others,
who, perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength
was diminished. On the other.hand, I told them I came to establish
them there, not to remove them: and then I let them
know that I had brought with me relief of sundry kinds
for them; that I had been at a great charge to supply
them with all things necessary, as well for their conve-
nience niencc as their defence; and that I had such and such
particular persons with me, as well to increase and re-
cruit their number, as by the particular necessary em-
ployments which they were bred to, being artificers, to
assist them in those things in which at present they
were to seek. They were altogether when I talked thus to them;
and before I delivered to them the stores I had brought,
I asked them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot and
buried the first animosities that had been among them,
and would shake hands with one another, and engage
in a strict friendship and union of interest, that so there
might be no more misunderstandings or jealousies.
Will. Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good
humour, said, they had met with affliction enough to
make them all sober, and enemies enough to make them
all friends; that, for his part, he would live and die with
them; and was so far from designing any thing against
the Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing to
him but what his own mad humour made necessary, and
what he would have done, and perhaps worse, in their
case; and that he would ask them pardon, if I desired
it, for the foolish and brutish things he had done to
them, and was very willing and desirous of living in
terms of entire friendship and union with them, and
would do any thing that lay in his power to convince
them of it; and as for going to England, he cared not if
he did not go thither these twenty years. The Spaniards said they had indeed at first disarmed
and excluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen for
their ill conduct, as they had let me know, and they
appealed to me for the necessity they were under to do
so; but that Will Atkins had behaved himself so brave-
123
lj in the great fight they had with the savages, and on
several occasions since, and had shewed himself so saith-
ful to, and concerned for the general interest of them
all, that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought
he merited as much to be trusted with arms and supplied
with necessaries as any of them; and they had testified
their satissaction in him, by committing the command
to him, next to the governor himself; and as they had
entire confidence in him and all his countrymen, so
they acknowledged they had merited that considence by
all the methods that honest men could merit to be va-
lued and trusted; and they most heartily embraced the x
occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would
never have any interest separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship,
we appointed the next day to dine all together, and in-
deed we made a splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook
and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner,
and the old cook's mate we had on shore assisted. We
brought on shore six pieces of good beef, and four pieces
of pork, out of iheship's provision, with our punch-
bowl, and materials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave
them ten bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of
English beer; things that neither the Spaniards or the
English had tasted for many years, and which, it may
be supposed, they were very glad of.
The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted; and three of them were sent,
covered up close, on board the ship to the seamen, that
they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, as we did
with their salt, meat from on board.
After this feast, at which we were very innocently
jnerry, I brought out my cargo of goods; wherein, that
there
ADVENTURES OF
there might be no dispute about dividing, I showed them
that there was sufficient for them all, desiring that they
might all take an equal quantity of the goods that were
for wearing; that is to say, equal when made up. As, first, I distributed linen sufficient to make every one of
them four shirts, and, at the Spaniards request, after-
wards made them up six; these were exceeding comfort-
able to them, having been what, as I may say, they
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear
them. I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned
before, to make every one a light coat like a frock,
which I judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool
and loose; and ordered that whenever they decayed they should make more, as they thought sit; the like for
pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, &c. I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, sat
upon the countenances of all these poor men, when they
saw the care I had taken of them, and how well I had
furnished them. They told me I was a father to them;
and that having such a correspondent as I was in so re-
mote a part of the world, it would make them forget
that they were left in a desolate place; and they all vo-
luntarily engaged to me not to leave the plaqe without;
my consent. Then I presented to them the people I had brought
with me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two
carpenters, all of them most necessary people; butabove.
all, my general artificer, than whom they could not
name any thing that was more useful to them: and the
tailor, to show his concern for them, went to work im-
mediately, and, with my leave, made them every one
a shirt, the first thing he did; and, which was still more, he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch, and
use the needle, but made them assist to make the shirts
for their husbands, and for all the rest. As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how use-
ful they were; for they took to pieces all my clumsy, un-
handy things, and made them clever convenient tables,
stools, bed-steads, cup-boards, lockers, shelves, and
every thing they wanted of that kind. But to let them see how nature made artificers at first,
I carried the carpenters to fee Will. Atkins's basket-house, as I called it: and they both owned they never
saw an instanceof such natural ingenuity before, nor any
thing so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind;
and one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good
while, turning about to me, I am sure, says he, that
man has no need of us; you need do nothing but give
him tools. Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and
gave every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake,
for we had no harrows or ploughs; and to every sepa-
rate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad-axe, and a saw;
always appointing, that as often as any were broken or
worn out they should be supplied, without grudging,
out of the general stores that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives,
scissars, and all sorts of iron-work, they had without
tale, as they required ; for no man would take more than
he wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste
or spoil-them on any account whatever; and, for the use
of the smith, I left two tons of unwfought iron, for a
supply. My magazine of powder and arms which I brought
them was such, even to profusion, that they could not but
but rejoice at them; for now they could march as I used
to do, with a musketupo'n each shoulder, if there was oc-
casion, and were able to fight a thousand savages, if they
had but some little advantages of situation, which also
they could not miss of, if they had occasion. I carried on shore with me the young man whose mo-
ther was starved to death, and the maid also: she was
a sober, well educated, religious'young woman, and
behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave her a good
word; she had indeedan unhappy life with us, there
being no woman in the ship but herself, but she boreit with patience. Aster a while, seeing things so well
ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my
island, and considering that they had neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or reason for taking
so long a voyage; I say, considering all this, both of them
came to me, and desired I would give them leave to re-
main on the island, and be entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to this readily; and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or
houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, pallisadoed like Atkins's, adjoining to his plantation. Their
tents were contrived so that they had each of them a
room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent, like a great
storehouse, to lay their goods in, and to eat and drink
in. And now the other two Englishmen removed their
habitation to the same place; and so the island was di-
vided into three colonies, and no more, viz. the Spani-
ards, with old Friday, and the first servants, at my old
habitation under the hill, which was, in a word, the
capital city; and where they had so enlarged and extended their works, as well under as on the outside of the $ hill,?
127
hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet
full at large. Never was there such a little city in a wood,
and so hid, I believe,in any part of the world; for I ve-
rily believe a thousand men mighthave ranged the island
a month, and, if they had not known there was such a
thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would not
have found it; for the trees stood so thick and so close,
and grew so fast mattered into one another, that nothing
but cutting them down first could discoverthe place,
except the only two narrow entrances where they went
in and out could be found, which was not very easy;
one of them was closedown at the water's edge on the
side of the creek, and it was afterwards above two hun-
dred yards to the place; and the other was up a ladder
at twice, as I have already formerly described it; and
they had also a large wood thick planted on the top of the
hill, which contained above an acre, which grew apace,
and concealed the place from all discovery there, with on-
ly one narrow place between two trees, not easily to be
discovered, to enter on that side. The other colony was that of Will. Akins, where
there were four families of Englishmen, I mean those
I had left there, with their wives and children; three sa-
vages that were slaves; the widow and the children of
the Englishman that was killed; the young man and
the maid; and, by the way, we made a wife of her before
we went away. There was also the two carpenters and
the tailor, whom I brought with me for them; also the smith, who was a very necessary man to them, es-
pecially as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms; and
my other man, whom I called Jack of all trades, who
was in himself as good almost as twenty men; for he was
not only a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry fel-
ADVENTURES OF
low; and before I went away we married him to the
honest maid that came with the youth in the ship I
mentioned before. And now I speak of marrying, it brings me natural-
ly to say something of the French ecclesiastic that I had
brought with me out of the ship's crew whom I took
up at sea. It is true, this man was a Roman, and per-
haps it may give offence to some hereafter, if I leave
any thing extraordinary upon record of a man whom,
before I begin, I must (to set him out in just colours)
represent in terms very much to his disadvantage,
in the account of Protestants; as first, that he was a
Papist; secondly, a Popish priest; and,thirdly, a French
Popish priest. But justice demands of me to give him a due charac-
ter; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and
most religious person; exact in his life, extensive in his
charity, and exemplary in almost every thing he did.
What then can any one say against being very sensible
of the value of such a man, notwithstanding his pro-
fession; though it may be my opinion, perhaps, as well
as the opinion of others who shall read this, that he
was mistaken. The first hour that I began to converse with him af-
ter he had agreed to go with me to the East-Indies, I
found reason to delight exceedingly in his conversation;
and he first began with me about religion in the most
obliging manner imaginable. Sir, says he, you have not only under God (and
at that he crossed his breast) saved my life, but you have
admitted me to go this voyage in your ship, and by your
obliging civility have taken me into your family, giv-
ing me an opportunity of free conversation. Now, sir, says
says he, you see by my habit what my profession is, and
I guess by your nation what yours is; I may think it
is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost en-
deavours, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I can
to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Ca-
tholic doctrine; but as I am here under your permis-
sion, and in your family, I am bound, in justice to your
kindness, as well as in decency and good manners,
to be under your government; and therefore I shall not,
without your leave, enter into any debate on the points
of religion in which we may not agree, farther than
you shall give me leave. I told him his carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true we were such
people as they called heretics, but that he was not the
first Catholic I had conversed with, without falling into
inconveniences, or carrying the questions to any height
in debate; that he should not find himself the worse
used for being of a different opinion from us; and if
we did not converse without any dislike on either side,
it should be his fault, not ours. He replied, that he thought all ourconverjation:might
be easily separated from disputes; that it was not his bu-
siness to cap principles with every man he conversed
with; and that he rather desired me to converse with
him as a gentleman than as a religionist; and that, if I
would give him leave at any time to discourse upon re-
ligious subjects, he would readily comply with it, and
that he did not doubt but I would allow him also to de-
fend his own opinions as well as he could; but that,
without my leave, he would not break in upon me with
any such thing. Vol. II. K He
He told me farther, that he would not cease to do all that became him, in his office as a priest as well as a
private Christian, to procure the good of the ship, and
the safety of all that was in her; and though perhaps
we would not join with him, and he could not pray
with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he
would do upon all occasions. In this manner we con-
versed; and, as he was of the most obliging, gentleman-
-like behaviour, so he was, if I may be allowed to say
so, a man of good sense, and, as I believe, of great
learning. He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and
of the many extraordinary events of it; of many ad-
ventures which had befallen him in the few years that
he had been abroad in the world; and particularly this
was very remarkable, viz. that in the voyage he was
now engaged in, he had had the misfortune to be five
times shipped and unshipped, and never to go to the
place whither any of the ships he was in were at first
designed. That his first intent was to have gone to
Martinico, and that he went on board a ship bound thi-
ther at St. Malo; but being forced into Lisbon by bad
weather, the ship received some damage by running
aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was
obliged to unload her cargo there; but finding a Por-
tuguese ship there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to
sail, and supposing he should easily meet with a vessel
there bound to Martinico, he went on board, in order
to sail to the Madeiras; but the master of the Portu-
guese ship, being but an indifferent mariner, had been
out of his reckoning, and they drove to Fyal; where,
however, he happened to find a very good market for
his cargo, which was corn, and therefore resolved not to
to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt at the isle of
May, and to go away to Newfoundland. He had no
remedy in this exigence but to go with the ship, and
had a pretty good voyage as far as the Banks (so they
call the place where they catch the fish) where meeting
with a French ship bound from France to Quebec, in
the river of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, to
carry provisions, he thought he should have an oppor-
tunity to complete his first design; but when he came
to Quebec, the master of the ship died, and the vessel proceeded no sarther; so the next voyage he shipped
himself for France, in the ship that was burned when
we took them up at sea; and then shipped with us for
the East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he had
been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it,
in one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to
mention farther of the same person. But I shall not make digression into other men's
stories, which have no relation to my own: I return
to what concerns our affairs in the island. He came
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the
while we were upon the island, and it happened to be
just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's colo-
ny, at the farthest part of the island; I say, he came to
me, and told me, with a very grave countenance, that
he had for two or three days desired an opportunity of
some discourse with me, which he hoped would not
be displeasing to me, because he thought it might in
some measure correspond with my general design,
which was, the prosperity of my new colony, and
perhaps might put it, at least more than he yet thought
it was, in the way of God's blessing. K 2 I looked
I looked a little surprised at the last part of his dis-
course, and turning a little short, How, Sir, said I,
can it be said that we are not in the way of God's bles-
sing, after such visible assistances and wonderful deliver-
ances as we have seen here, and of which I have given
you a large account i
If you had pleased, Sir, said he, with a world of
modesty, and yet with great readiness, to have heard
me, you would have found no room to have been dis-
pleased, much less to think so hard of me, that I should
suggest that you have not had wonderful assistances and
deliverances; and I hope, on your behalf, that you are
in the way of God's blessing, as your design is exceed-
ing good, and will prosper: but, sir, though it were
more so than is even possible to you, yet there may be
some among you that are not equally right in their ac-
tions: and you know, that in the story of the children of Israel, one Achan in the camp, removed God's bles-
sing from them, and turned his hand so against them,
that six and thirty of them, though not concerned in the crime, were the objects of divine vengeance, and
bore the weight of that punishment. I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told
him his inference was so just, and the whole design
seemed so sincere, and was really so religious in its
own nature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted
him, and begged him to go on: and, in the mean time,
because it seemed that what we had both to say might
take up some time, I told him I was going to the
Englishmen's plantations, and asked him to go with
me, and we might discourse of it by the way. He told
me he would the more willingly wait on me thither, because there partly the thing was acted which he de-
sired)
sired to speak to me about; so we walked on, and I
pressed him to be free and plain with me in what he
had to say. Why then, Sir, says he, be pleased to give me leave
to lay down a few propositions, as the foundation of
what I have to say, that we may not differ in the ge-
neral principles, though we may be of some differing
opinions in the practice of particulars. First, sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of re-
ligion, and it is very unhappy it is so, especially in the
case before us, as I shall show afterwards, yet there are
some general principles in which we both agree,/viz.
first, That there is a God; and that this God having
given us some stated general rules for our service and
obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to
offend him, either by neglecting to do what he has
commanded, or by doing what he has expressly forbid-
den: and let our different religions be what they will,
this general principle is readily owned by us all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow pre-
sumptuous sinning against his command; and every
good Christian will be affectionately concerned to pre-
vent any that are under his care living in a total neg-
lect of God and his commands. It is not your men
being Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of
such, that discharges me from being concerned for their
souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before me,
that they should live in as little distance from enmity
with their Maker as possible, especially if you give me
leave to meddle so far in your circuit. I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told
him I granted all he had said, and thanked him that
he would so far concern himself for us; and begged he K 3 would
would explain the particulars of what he had observed,
that, -like Jofhua, to take his own parable, I might
put away the accursed thing from us. Why then, Sir, says he, I will take the liberty you
give me; and there are three things, which, if I am
right, must stand in the way of God's blessing upon
your endeavours here, and which I should rejoice, for
your sake, and their own, to see removed: and, Sir,
says he, I promise myself that you will fully agree
with me in them all, as soon as I name them; espe-
cially because I shall convince you that every one of
them may, with great ease, and very much to your sa-,
tissaction, be remedied.
He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities,
but went on:— First, Sir, says he, you have here four
Englishmen, who have fetched women from among the
savages, and have taken them as their wives, and have had
many children by them all, and yet are not married to
them after any stated, legal manner, as the laws of God
and man require; and therefore are yet, in the sense of
both, no less than fornicators, if not living in adulte-
ry. To this, Sir, says he, I know you will object that there was no clergyman or priest of any kind, or
of any profession, to perform the ceremony; nor any
pen and ink, or paper, to write down a contract of
marriage, and have it signed between them: and I know
also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you, I
mean, of the agreement that he obliged them to make
when they took those women, viz. that they should
choose them out by consent, and keep separately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage,
no agreement with the women, as wives, but only an agreement
i35
agreement among themselves, to keep them from
quarrelling. But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimo-
ny (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not only
in the mutual consent of the parties to take one ano-
ther as man and wife, but in the formal and legal obli-
gation that there is in the contract, to compel the man
and woman, at all times, to own and acknowledge
each other; obliging the man to abstain from all other
women, to engage in no other contract while these
subsist, and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to pro-
vide honestly for them and their children, and to oblige
the women to the same, or like conditions, mutatis
mutandis, on their side. Now, Sir, says he, these men may, when they
please or when occasion presents, abandon these wo-
men, disown their children, leave them to perish, and
take other women, and marry them while these are
living; and here he added, with some warmth, How,
sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty? and how
shall a blessing succeedyour endeavours in this place,
however good in themselves, and however sincere in
your design, while these men, who at present are your
subjects, under your absolute government and domi-
nion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery?I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much
more with the convincing arguments he supported it
with; for it was certainly true, that though they had
no clergyman upon the spot, yet a formal contract on
both sides, made before witnesses, and confirmed by
any token which they had all agreed to be bound by,
though it had been but breaking a stick between them,
engaging the men to own these women for their wives K 4 upon
ADVENTURES OF
upon all occasions, and never to abandon them or their
children, and the women to the same with their hus-
bands, had been an effectual lawful marriage in the
sight of God; and it was a great neglect that it was
not done. But I thought to have got off my young priest by
telling him that all that part was done when I was not
here; and they had lived so many years with them now,
that if it was adultery, it was past remedy; they could
do nothing in it now. Sir, says he, asking your pardon for such freedom,
you are right in this, that it being done in your ab-
sence, you could not be charged with that part of the crime; but, I beseech you, flatter not yourself that you
are not therefore under an obligation to do your utmost
now to put an end to it. How can you think but that,
let the time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt, for
the future, will lie entirely upon you? Because it is
certainly in your power now to put an end to it, and
in nobody's power but your's.
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right;
but I imagined, that by putting an end to it, he meant
that I should part them, and not suffer them to live to-
gether any longer: and I said to him I could not do
that, by any means, for that it would put the whole
island into confusion: he seemed surprised that I should
so far mistake him. No, Sir, says he, I do not mean
that you should now separate them, but legally and ef-
fectually marry them now; and as, sir, my way of
marrying them may not be easy to reconcile them to,
though it will be effectual, even by your own laws, so
your way may be as well before God, and as valid
among men; I mean, by a written contract signed by both
both man and woman, and by all the witnesses present,
which all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid,
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much
sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in
his discourse as to his own party or church, and such
true warmth for preserving people that he had no
knowledge of or relation to; I say, for preserving them
from transgressing the laws of God, the like of which I
had indeed not met with any where: but recollecting
what he had said of marrying them by a written con-
tract, which I knew he would stand to, I returned it
back upon him, and told him, I granted all that he had
said to be just, and on his part very kind; that I would
discourse with the men upon the point now, when I
came to them, and I knew no reason why they should
scruple to let him marry them all, which I knew well
enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid
in England as if they were married by one of our own
clergymen; what was afterwards done in this matter,
I shall speak of by itself. I then pressed him to tell me what was the second
complaint which he had to make, acknowledging that
I was very much his debtor for the first, and thanked
him heartily for it. He told me he would use the
same freedom and plainness in the second, and hoped
I would take it as well; and this was, that notwithstand-
ing these English subjects of mine, as he called them,
had lived with those women for almost seven years, had
taught them to speak English, and even to read it, and
that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable
understanding, and capable of instruction, yet they
had not, to this hour, taught them any thing of the
Christian religion, no, not so much as to know that there
ADVENTURES OF
there was a God, or a worship, or in what manner
God was to be served; or that their own idolatry, and
worshipping they knew not whom, was false and ab-
surd. This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to account for,
and perhaps, at last, take the work out of their hands—he spoke this very affectionately and warmly. I am
persuaded, says he, had those men lived in the savage
country whence their wives came, the savages would
have taken more pains to have brought them to be ido-
laters, and to worship the devil, than any of these men,
so far as he could fee, have taken with them to teach
them the knowledge of the true God. Now, Sir,
said he, though I do not acknowledge your religion,
or you mine, yet we would be glad to see the devil's
servants, and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to
know the general principles of the Christian religion;
that they might, at least, hear of God and of a Re-
deemer, and of the resurrection, and of a future state,—things which we all believe; they had, at least, been
so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true
church than they are now, in the public profession of
idolatry and devil-worship. I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms,
and embraced him with an excess of passion. . How sar,
said I to him, have I been from understanding the
most essential part of a Christian! viz. to love the in-
terest of the Christian church, and the good of other
men's souls: I scarce have known what belongs to the
being a Christian. O, Sir, do not say so, replied he;
this thing is not your sault. No, says I; but why
did I never lay it to heart as well as you? It is not too
late yet, said he; be not too forward to condemn your-
self,
'5
self. But what can be done now? said I: you see I
am going away. Will you give me leave to talk with
these poor men about it? Yes, with all my heart, said
I; and will oblige them to give heed to what you say
too. As to that, said he, we must leave them to the
mercy of Christ; but it is your business to assist them,
encourage them, and instruct them; and if you give
me leave, and God his blessing, I do not doubt but the
poor ignorant souls shall be brought home to the great
circle of Christianity, if not into the particular faith we all embrace, and that even while you stay here.
Upon this I said, I shall not only give you leave, but
give you a thousand thanks for it. What followed on
this account, I shall mention also again in its place. I now pressed him for the third article in which
we were to blame. Why, really, says he, it is of the
same nature; and I will proceed, asking your leave,
with the same plainness as before: it is about your
poor savages, who are, as I may say, your conquered
subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or ought to be, received among all Christians, of what church or pre-
tended church soever, viz. The Christian knowledge
ought to be propagated by all possible means, and on all
possible occasions. It is on this principle that our
church sends missionaries into Persia, India, China;
and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, will-
ingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and
the most dangerous residence among murderers and
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true
God, and to bring them over to embrace the Chris-
tian faith. Now, sir, you have such an oppor-
tunity here to have six or seven and thirty poor sa-
vages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of
God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you-
you can pass such an occasion of doing good, which is
really worth the expense of a man's whole life. I was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one
word to say. I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal
for God and religion before me, let his particular prin-
ciples be of what kind soever: as for me, I had not so
much as entertained a thought of this in my heart before,
and I believe I should not have thought of it; for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we had any work for them to do, we would have
used as such, or would have been glad to have trans-
ported them to any other part of the world: for our
business was to get rid of them, and we would all have
been satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so
they had never seen their own. But to the case;—I say
1 was confounded at his discourse, and knew not what
answer to make him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disor-
der; Sir, says he, I shall be very sorry if what I have
said gives you any offence: No, no, says I, I am offen-
ded with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly con-
founded, not only to think that I should never take
any notice of this before, but with reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, Sir, said
I, what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the
East Indies in a ship freighted by merchants, and to
whom it would be an insufferable piece of injustice to
detain their ship here, the men lying all this while at
victuals and wages on the owners' account. It is
true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I
stay more, I must pay three pounds sterling per diem de-
murrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight
days more, and I have been here thirteen already; so that
Hs
that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work, un-
less I would suffer myself to be left behind here again;
in which case, if this single ship should miscarry in any
part of her voyage, I should be just in the same con-
dition that I was left in here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully delivered. He owned the
case was very hard upon me, as to my voyage; but laid
it home upon my conscience, whether the blessing of
saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all
I had in the world for. I was not so sensible of that as
he was. I returned upon him thus: Why, sir, it is
a valuable thing indeed to be an instrument in God's
hand to convert thirty-seven heathens to the know-
ledge of Christ; but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are
given over to the work, so that it seems so naturally to
fall into the way of your profession, how is it then that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it,
than press me to do it?''
Upon this he faced aboutjust before me, as he walk-
ed along, and putting me to a full stop, made me a
very low bow : I most heartily thank God and you, Sir,
says he, for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a
work; and if you think yourself discharged from it,
and desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it,
and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and
difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I
have met with, that I am dropped at last into so glori-
ous a work. I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he
spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his colour came and went, as if he had
been falling into fits; in a word, he was fired with the
joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a con-
ADVENTURES OF
considerable while before I could tell what to say to him; for I was really surprised to find a man of such
sincerity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond
the ordinary rate of men, not of his profession only,
but even of any profession whatsoever. But after I had
considered it awhile, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would venture, on the single con-
sideration of an attempt on those poor people, to be
locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his life,
and at last might not know whether he should be able
to do them good or not?He turned short upon me, and asked me what I call-
ed a venture ? Pray, Sir, said he, what do you think I consented to go in your ship to the East Indies for?
Nay, said I, that I know not, unless it was to preach
to the Indians. Doubtless it was, said he; and do
you think, if I can convert these thirty-seven men to
the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not worth my time,
though I should never be fetched off the island again;
nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many
souls than my life is, or the life of twenty more of
the same profession? Yes, Sir, says he, I would give
Christ and the blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I
could be made the least happy instrument of saving the
souls of those poor men, though I was never to set my
foot off this island, or see my native country any more.
But since you will honour me, fays he, with putting
me into this work, for which I will pray for you all
the days of my life, I have one humble petition to .you,
said he, besides. What is that? said I. Why, says he,
it is, that you will leave your man Friday with me, to
be my interpreter to them, and to assist me; for with-
out some help I cannot speak to them, or they to me.
I was
I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, be-
cause I could not think of parting with him, and that
for many reasons: he had been the companion of my
travels; he was not only faithful to me, but sincerely
affectionate to the last degree; and I had resolved to do
something considerable for him if he outlived me, as
it was probable he would; then I knew that as I had
bred Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite con-
found him to bring him to embrace another profession;
and he would never, while his eyes were open, believe
that his old master was a heretic, and would be damned;
and this might, in the end, ruin the poor fellow's
principles, and so turn him back again to his first ido-
latry. However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait,
and it was this: I told . him, I could not say that I was
willing to part with Friday on any account whatever,
though a work that to him was of more value than his
life, ought to be to me of much more value than the
keeping or parting with a servant:— But, on the other
hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no means
agree to part with me, and I could not force him to it without his consent, without manifest injustice; be-
cause I had promised I would never put him away, and
he had promised and engaged to me that he would
never leave me unless I put him away. He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no
rational access to these poor people, seeing he did not
understand one word of their language, nor they one
word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him Fri-
day's father had learned Spanish, which I found he
also
ADVENTURES OF
also understood, and he should serve him as an interpreter. So he was much better satisfied ; and nothing could
persuade him but he would stay and endeavour to con-
Vert them; but Providence gave another very happy
turn to all this. I come back now to the first part of his objections.
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all
together, and after some account given them of what I
had done for them, viz. what necessary things I had
provided for them, and how they were distributed, which
they were very sensible of, and very thankful for, I be-
gan to talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and
gavethem a full account of the notice the clergyman had
taken of it; and arguing how unchristian and irreligious
a life it was, I first asked them if they were married
men or bachelors? They soon explained their condi-
tions to me, and showed that two of them were widow-
ers, and the other three were single men, or bachelors.
I asked them with what conscience they could take those
women, and lie with them as they had done, call them
their wives, and have so many children by them, and
not be lawfully married to them?They all gave me the answer I expected, viz. that
there was nobody to marry them; that they agreed be-
fore the governor to keep them as their wives, and to
maintain them and own them as their wives; and they
thought, as things stood with them, they were as legal-
ly married as if they had been married by a parson, and
with all the formalities in the world. I told them that no doubt they were married in the
sight of God, and were bound in conscience to keep
them as their wives; but that the laws of men being
otherwise, they might desert the poor women and chil-
dren '6ten hereafter; and that their wives being poor desolate
women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way
to help themselves: I therefore told them that unless
I was assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing
for them, but would take care that what I did should
be for the women and children without them; and that
unless they would give me some assurances that they
would marry the women, I could not think it was con-
venient they should continue together as man and wife,
for that it was both scandalous to men and offensive to
God, who they could not think would bless them if
they went on thus. All this went on as I expected; and they told me, es-
pecially Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the
rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they had
been born in their own native country, and would not
leave them upon any account whatever; and they did ve-
rily believe their wives were as virtuous and as modest,
and did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them
and for their children, as any women could possibly do;
and they would not part with them on any account: and
Will Atkins, for his own particular, added, that if
any man would take him away, and offer to carry him
home to England, and make him captain of the best
man of war in the navy, he would not go with him, if
he might not carry his wife and children with him; and
if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would be mar-
ried to her now with all his heart. This was just as I would have it: the priest was not
with me at that moment, but was not far off; so, to try
him farther, I told him I had a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere, Iwould have him married next morn-
ing, and bade him consider of it, and talk with the rest.
Vol. II. L He
ADVENTURES OF
He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at all,
for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a mi-
nister with me, and he believed they would be all wil-
ling also. I then told him that my friend, the mini-
ster, was a Frenchman, and could not speak English,
but I would act the clerk between them. He never so
much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant,
which was indeed what I was afraid of; but, I say, they
never enquired about it,so we parted. I went back to
my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with
his companions. I desired the French gentleman not
to say anything to them till the business was thorough
ripe; and I told him what answer the men had given
me. Before I went from their quarter, they all came to
me, and told me they had been considering what I had
said; that they were glad to hear I had a clergyman in
my company, and they were very willing to give me the
satisfaction I desired, and to be formally married as soon
as I pleased; for they were far from desiring to part
with their wives, and that they meant nothing but what
was very honest when they chose them. So I appoint-
ed them to meet me the next morning, and in the mean
time, they should let their wives know the meaning of
the marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent
any scandal, but also to oblige them that they should
not forsake them, whatever might happen. The women were easily made sensible of the meaning
of the thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as in-
deed they had reason to be: so they failed not to attend
all together at my apartment next morning, where I
brought out my clergyman; and though he had not on
a minister's gown, after the manner of England, or the habit
habit of a priest, after the manner of France, yet hav-
ing a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sasti
round it, he did not look very unlike a minister; and
as for his language* I was his interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the
scruples he made of marrying the women, because they
were not baptized and professed Christians, gave them
an exceeding reverence for his person; and there was
no need, after that, to enquire whether he was a cler-
gyman or not. v
Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been car-
ried so sar, as that he would not have married them at
all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able'to say to him,
he relisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily; and
at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had
first talked with' the men and the women too; and
though at first I was a little backward to it, yet at last
I agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the sinceri-
ty of his design.
When he came to them, he let them know that I
had acquainted him with1 their circumstances, and with
the present design; that he was very willing to perform
that part of his function, and marry them as I had de-
fired; but that before he could do it, he must take the
liberty to talk with them. He told them, that in the
sight of all indifferent men, and in the fense of the laws
of society, they had lived all this while in open fornica-
tion; and that it was true, that nothing but the con-
senting to marry, or effectually separating them from
one another, could now put an end to it; but there was
a difficulty in it too, with respect to the laws of Chris-
tian matrimony, which he was not fully satisfied about,
viz. that of marrying one that is a professed Christian
L 2 to
to a savage, an idolater and a heathen, one that is not
baptized; and yet that he did not see that there was time
left to endeavour to persuade the women to be bap-
tized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom they had,
he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they
could not be baptized.
He told them he doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had but little know-
ledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he could not
expect that they had said much to their wives on that
head yet; but that unless they would promise him to
use their endeavours with their wives to persuade them
to become Christians, and would, as well as they could,
instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that
made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeem-
ed them, he could not marry them; for he would have
no hand in joining Christians with savages; nor was it
consistentwith the principles of the Christian religion,
and was indeed expressly forbidden in God's law. They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered
it very faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his
own words as I could; only sometimes adding something
of my own, to convince them how just it was, and how
I was of his mind: and I always very faithfully distin-
guished between what I said from myself, and what
were the clergyman's words. They told me it was ve-
ry true what the gentleman said, that they were very
indifferent Christians themselves, and that they had ne-
ver talked to their wives about religion. Lord, Sir,
says Will Atkins, how should we teach them religion?
why, we know nothing ourselves; and besides, Sir, said
he, should we talk to them of God and Jesus Christ,
and heaven and hell, it would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe ourselves? And if we
should tell them that we believe all the things we speak
of to them, such as of good people going to heaven, and
wicked people to the devil, they would ask us where
we intend to go ourselves, that believe all this, and are
such wicked fellows as we indeed are? Why, Sir,'tis
enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing;
folks must have some religion themselves before they
pretend to teach other people. Will. Atkins, said I to
him, though I am afraid that what you say has too
much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife she is
in the wrong? That there is a God, and a religion
better than her own; that her gods are idols; that they
can neither hear nor speak; that there is a great Being
that made all things, and that can destroy all that he has made; that he rewards the good and punishes the bad;
and that we are to be judged by him at last for all we do
here: you are not so ignorant, but even nature itself
will teach you that all this is true; and I am satisfied you
know it all to be true, and believe it yourself.
That is true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what face can I say any thing to my wife of all this, when she
will tell me immediately it cannot be true.
Not true, said I, what do you mean by that? Why,
Sir, said he, she will tell me it cannot be true that this
God I shall tell her of can be just, or can punish or re-
ward, since I am not punished and sent to the devil,
that have been such a wicked creature as she knows I
have been, even to her, and to every-body else; and
that I should be suffered to live, that have been always
acting so contrary to what I must tell her is good, and
to what I ought to have done.
L 3 Why,
Why, truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speak-
cst too much truth; and with that I informed the cler-
gyman of what Atkins had said, for he was impatient
to know. O, said the priest, tell him there is one
thing will make him the best minister in the world to
his wife, and that is, repentance; for none teach re-
pentance like true penitents. He wants nothing but to
repent, and then he will be so much the better qualified
to instruct his wife; he will then able to tell her that there is not only a God, and that he is the just re-
warder of good and evil, but that he is a merciful being, and with infinite goodness and long-suffering forbears
to punish those that offend; waiting to be gracious,
and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that
he should return and live: that oftentimes he suffers
wicked men to go a long time, and even reserves dam-
nation to the general day of retribution; that it is a
clear evidence of God and of a future state, that
righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked men
their punishment, till they come into another world;
and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of
the resurrection and of the last judgement. Let him
but repent for himself, he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife. I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious
all the while, and who, we could easily perceive, was
more than ordinarily affected with it: when being ea-
ger, and hardly suffering me to make an end, I know
all this, master, says he, and a great deal more; but
I have not the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when God and my conscience know, and my wife will
be an undeniable evidence against me, that I have lived
as if I had never heard of a God or future state, or any thing
tiling about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and
with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that the
tears stood in his eyes) 'tis past all that with me. Past
it! Atkins, said I; what dost thou mean by that? I
know well enough what I mean, says he; I mean 'tis
too late, and that is too true. -
I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said:
the poor zealous priest,—I must call him so, for, be his
opinion what it will, he had certainly a most singular
affection for the good of other men's fouls, and it
would be hard to think he had not the like for his
own,—I say, this affectionate man could not refrain
tears also; but, recovering himself, said to me,
Ask him but one question ; is he easy that it is too late; or is he troubled, and wishes it were not so? I put
the question fairly to Atkins; and he answered, with a
great deal of passion, how could any man be easy in a
condition that must certainly end in eternal destruc-
tion? that he was far from being easy; but that, on
the contrary, he believed it would, one time or other,
ruin him. What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he said,
he believed he should one time or other cut his throat,
to put an end to the terror of it. The clergyman shook his head, with great concern
in his face, when I told him all this; but turning
quick to me upon it, says he, if that be his case, we
may assure him it is not too late; Christ will give him
repentance. But, pray, says he, explain this to him;
that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the merit of
his passion procuring divine mercy for him, how can it
be too late for any man to receive mercy? Does he think
he is able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine
L 4 mercy?
mercy Pray tell him, there may be a time when pro-
voked mercy will no longer strive, and when God may
refuse to hear, but that 'tis never too late for men to
ask mercy ; and we, that are Christ's servants, are com-
manded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of
Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent; so that
it is never too late to repent.
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
earnestness; but it seemed as if he turned off the
discourse to the rest, for he said to me, he would
go and have some talk with his wife; so he went out
a while, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they
were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, as
much as I was when I went rambling away from my
sather; and yet that there were none of them backward
to hear what had been said; and all of them seriously
promised that they would talk with their wives about
it, and do their endeavour to persuade them to turn
Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported
what answer they gave, but said nothing a good while;
but at last shaking his head, We that are Christ's ser-
vants, says he, can go no sarther than to exhort and
instruct, and when men comply, submit to the reproof,
and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are
bound to accept their good words: but, believe me,
Sir, said he, whatever you may have known of the life
of that man you call Will. Atkins, I believe he is the
only sincere convert among them; I take that man to
be a true penitent; I won't despair of the rest; but
that man is apparently struck with the fense of his past
life, and 1 doubt not, when he comes to talk of reli-
gion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it;
for attempting to teach others, is sometimes the best
way of teaching ourselves, I know a man, who hav-
ing
ing nothing but a summary notion religion himself,
and being wicked and profligate to the last degree in his
life, made a thorough reformation in himself by la-
bouring to convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins be-
gins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his
wife, my life for it, he talks himself into a thorough
convert, makes himself a penitent, and who knows
what may follow?
Upon this discourse, however, and their promising,
as above, to endeavour to persuade their wives to em-
brace Christianity, he married the other two couple;
but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come in.
After this, my clergyman waiting awhile, was curi-
ous to know where Atkins was gone; and turning to
me, says he, 1 intreat you, Sir, let us walk out of your
labyrinth here, and look; I dare say we shall find this
poor man somewhere or other talking seriously to his
wife, and teaching her already something of religion.
I began to be of the same mind; so we went out toge-
ther, and I carried him a way which none knew but
myself, and where the trees were so thick set asthat
it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves,
and far harder to fee in, than to see out; when com-
ing to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and his
tawny wife sitting under the shade of a
bush, very eager in discourse: I stopped short till my clergyman came up to me, and then having showed him where they were, we stood and looked very steadily
at them a good while. We observed him very earnest
with her, pointing up to the sun, and to every
quarter of the heavens, and then down to the earth,
then out to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to the
woods, tothe trees. Now, says my clergy man, you see my
words are made good, the man preaches to her; mark
him now, he is telling her that our God has made him and
and her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods,
the trees, &c. I believe he is, said I. Immediately we
perceived Will Atkins start upon his feet, fall down on
his knees, and lift up both his hands. We supposed he
said something, but we could not hear him; it was too
far for that. He did not continue kneeling half a mi-
nute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and
talks to her again; we perceived then the woman very
attentive, but whether she said any thing or no, we
could not tell. While the poor fellow was upon his
knees, I could see the tears run plentifully down my
clergyman's cheeks, and I could hardly forbear myself;
but it was a great affliction to us both that we were not
near enough to hear any thing that passed between them. Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear
of disturbing them; so we resolved to see an end of this
piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to
us without the help of voice. He sat down again, as
I have said, close by her, and talking again earnestly to
her, and two or three times we could fee him embrace
her most passionately; another time we saw him take
out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss
her again, with a kind of transport very unusual; and
after several of these things, we saw him on a sudden
jump up again, and lend her his hand, to help her up,
when immediately leading her by the hand a step or two,
they both kneeled down together, and continued so
about two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud,—St. Paul! St. Paul! behold he prayeth: I was
afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore I entreated
him to withhold himself a while, that we might see
an end of the scene, which to me, I must confess, was
tho
the most affecting that ever I saw in my life. Well, he
strove with himself for a while, but was in such rap-
tures to think that the poor heathen woman was be-
come a Christian, that he was not able to contain him-
self; he wept several times, then throwing up his
hands and crossing his breast, said over several things
ejaculatory, and by way of giving God thanks for so
miraculous a testimony of the success of our endea-
vours ; some he spoke softly, and I could not well hear
others; some in Latin, some in French; then two or
three times the tears would interrupt him, that he could
not speak at all; but I begged that he would contain
himself, and let us more narrowly and fully observe
what was before us, which he did for a time, the scene
not being ended there yet; for after the poor man and
his wife were risen again from their knees, we observed
he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we observed
her motion, that she was greatly affected with what he
said, by her frequent lifting up her hands, laying her
hand to her breast, and such other postures as express
the greatest seriousness and attention; this continued
about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked
away; so we could see no more of them in that situation.
I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; and
first I was glad to see the particulars we had both been
witnesses to, that, though 1 was hard enough of belief
in such cases, yet that I began to think it was all very
sincere here, both in the man and his wife, however
ignorant they might both be, and I hoped such a begin-
ning would have yet a more happy end: and who knows,
said I, but these two may, in time, by instruction and
example, work upon some of the others? Some of them,
said he, turning quick upon me; aye, upon all of
them:
them: depend upon it, if those two savages, for he has
been but little better, as you relate it, should embrace
Jesus Christ, they will never leave it till they work up-
on all the rest; for true religion is naturally communi-
cative, and he that is once made a Christian will never
leave a pagan behind him, if he can help it. I owned
it was a most Christian principle to think so, and a tes-
timony of true zeal, as well as a generous heart, in
him. But, my friend, said I, will you give me leave
to start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object
the least thing against that affectionate concern which
you show for the turning the poor people from their
paganism to the Christian religion: but how does this
comfort you, while these people are, in your account,
out of the pale of the catholic church, without which
you believe there is no salvation? so that you esteem
these but heretics, for other reasons as effectually lost
as the pagans themselves.
To this he answered, with abundance of candour,
thus: Sir, I am a catholic of the Roman church, and
a priest of the order of St. Benedict, and I embrace all
the principles of the Roman saith? but yet, if you will
believe me, and that I do not speak in compliment to
you, or in respect to my circumstances and your civi-
lities; I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who
call yourselves reformed, without some charity: I dare
not say (though I know it is our opinion in general)
that you cannot be saved; I will by no means limit the
mercy of Christ so far as to think that he cannot receive
you into the bosom of his church, in a manner to us
unperceivable; and I hope you have the same charity
for us: I pray daily for your being all restored to Christ's
church, by whatsoever methods He, who is all-wise, is pleased
pleased to direct : in the mean time, sure you will allow it
consists with me, as a Roman, to distinguish far between
a Protestant and a pagan; between one that calls on
Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not think is
according to the true faith, and a savage or a barbarian,
that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer; and
if you are not within the pale of the catholic church,
we hope you are nearer being restored to it than those
that know nothing of God or of his church: and I re-
joice, therefore, when I see this poor man, whom you
say has been a profligate, and almost a murderer, kneel
down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did,
though not fully enlightened; believing that God, from
whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly touch his
heart, and bring him to the farther knowledge of that
truth in his own time: and if God shall influence this
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage,
his wife, I can never believe that he shall be cast-away
himself: and have I not reason then to rejoice the nearer
any are brought to the knowledge of Christ, though
they may not be brought quite home into the bosom
of the catholic church just at the time when I may de-
sire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect his
work in his own time, and in his own way. Certain-t
ly, I would rejoice if all the savages in America were
brought, like this poor woman, topraytoGod, though
they were all to be protestants at first, rather than they
should continue pagans or heathens; firmly believing,
that he that had bestowed the first light to them would
farther illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly
grace, and bring them into the pale of his church, when
he should see good.
5 I was
ADVENTURES OF
I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this
pious papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power
of his reasoning; and it presently occurred to my
thoughts, that if such a temper was universal, we might
be all catholic Christians, whatever church or particu-
lar profession we joined in; that a spirit of charity would
soon work us all up into right principles; and as he
thought that the like charity would make us all catholics, so I told him I believed had all the members of
his church the like moderation, they would soon be all
Protestants:—And there we left that part; for we never
disputed at all. However, I talked to him another way, and taking
him by the hand, My friend, says I, I wish all the cler-
gy of the Roman church were blest with such modera-
tion, and had an equal share of your charity. I am en-
tirely of your opinion: but I must tell you, that if you
should preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy, they
would put you into the Inquisition.
It may be so, said he; I know not what they would
do in Spain or Italy; but I will not say they would be
the better Christians for that severity; for I am sure
there is no heresy in abounding with charity.
Well, as Will. Atkins and his wife were gone, our
business there was over, so we went back our own way;
and when we came back, we found them waiting to be
called in: observing this, I asked my clergyman if we
should discover to him that we had seen him under the
bush or not; and it was his opinion we should not,
but that we should talk to him first, and hear what he
would say to us; so we called him in alone, nobody
being in the place but ourselves, and I began with
him thus:
Will.
159
Will. Atkins, .said I, prithee what education had
you? What was your sather?
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be: Sir, my
father was a clergyman. R. C. What education did he give you?
fV. A. He would have taught me well, sir; but I
despised all education, instruction, or correction, like
a beast as I was.
R. C. It is true, Solomon says, He that despises re-
proof is brutish. W. A. Aye, Sir, I was brutish indeed, for I mur-
dered my father: for God's sake, sir, talk no more
about that; Sir, I murdered my poor father. Pr. Ha! a murderer!Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word
as he spoke) and looked pale: it seems he believed that
Will had really killed his father. R. C. No, no, Sir; I do not understand him so:
Will. Atkins explain yourself; you did not kill your father, did you, with your own hands?
IV. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his throat; but I cut
the thread of all his comforts, and shortened his days: I broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural re-
turn, for the most tender, affectionate treatment that
ever gave, or child could receive. R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father, to
extort this confession: I pray God give you repentance
for it, and forgive that and all yourother sins; but I
asked you because I see that though you have not much
learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are in
things that are good; that you have known more of re-
ligion, a great deal, than you have practised. T V. A.
ADVENTURES Op
W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the con-
fession that I make about my father, conscience does;
and whenever we come to look back upon our lives, the
sins against our indulgent parents are certainly the first
that touch us; the wounds they make lie deepest, and
the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind,
of all the sins we can commit.
R.'C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me,
Atkins; I cannot bear it. W. A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it. R. C. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every'hill, nay, I
may say every tree in this island, is witness to the an-i
guisli of my soul for my ingratitude and bad usage of a
good, tender father; a father much like yours, by
your description: and I murdered my father as well as
you, Will Atkins; but I think, for all that, my re-
pentance is short of yours too, by a great deal. I would have said more, if I could have restrained
my passions; but I thought this poor man's repentance
was so much sincerer than mine, that I was going to
leave off the discourse and retire; for I was surprised with what he had said, and thought that instead of
my going about to teach and instruct him, the man was
made a teacher and instructor to me in a most surprising and unexpected manner. I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was
greatly affected with it, and said to me,—Did I not say,
sir, that when this man was converted he would preach
to us all? I tell you, sir, if this one man be made a
true penitent, here will be no need of me; he will make
Christians of all in the island:—But having a little com-
posed myself, I renewed my discourse with Will. Atkins.
But,
Sut Will, said I, how comes the sense of this mat-
ter to touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has
struck a dart through my very soul; I have been talking
about God and religion to my wife, in order, as you
directed me, to make a Christian of her, and she has
preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget
while I live. R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to
you; but when you were moving religious arguments
to her, conscience has flung them back upon you. W. A. Aye, Sir, with such force as is not to be re-
sisted.
R.C. Pray'Will, let us know what passed between
you and your wife; for I know something of it al-
ready;
IV. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account
of it; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue
to express it; but let her have said what she will, and
though I cannot give you an account of it, this I can
tell you of it,- that I resolve to amend and reform my
life. R. C. But tell us some of it: how did you begin,
Will? For this has been an extraordinary cafe, that's
certain. She has preached a sermon, indeed, if she has
wrought this upon you.
JV. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our laws
about marriage, and what the reasons were that men
and women were obliged to enter into such compacts,
as it was neither in the power of one nor other to break;
thatotherwise, order and justicecould not be maintain-
ed, and men would run from their wives, and abandon
their children, mix confusedly with one another, and Vol. II. M neither
neither families be kept entire, nor inheritances be set-
tled by legal descent,
jR. C. You talk like a civilian, Will.; could you
make her understand what you meant by inheritance
and samilies? They know no such things among the
savages, but marry any how, without regard to rela-
tion, consanguinity, or family; brother and sister ; nay,
as I have been told, even the father and the daughter,
and the son and the mother. W. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my
wife assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it;
perhaps, for any farther relations, they may not be so
exact as we are; but she tells me they never touch one
another in the near relationship you speak of. R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was
much better than in her country. R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?W. A. Aye, aye; there began our dialogue. I asked
her if she would be married to me ourway ? She asked me
what way that was. I told her marriage was appointed
by God; and here we had a strange talk together in-ideed, as ever man and wife had, I believe. N.B. This dialogue between Will Atkins and his
wife I took down in writing, just after he told it
me, which was as follows:
Wife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a
God in your country?
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country.
Wife. No your God in my country; my country
have the great old Benamuckee God. W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who God
is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven and the
earth, the sea, and all that in them is.
Wife
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163Wife. No makee de earth; no you God makee all earth;
no makee my country.
Will. Atkins laughed a little at her expression of
God not making her country. Wife. No laugh; why laugh me? This nothing to
laugh. He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more
serious than he at first.
IV. A. That's true, indeed; I will not laugh any
more, my dear.
TVife. Why you say you God makee all?W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world,
and you and me, and all things; for he is the only true
God, and there is no God but him; he lives for ever
iri heaven.
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago?
'fV. A. That's true, indeed; but I have been a wick-
ed wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint
thee with any thing before, but have lived without
God in the world myself.
Wife .What, have you a great God in your country,
you no know him? No say O to him? No do good
thing for him? That no possible?
W. A. It is too true; though for all that, we live as if
there was no God in heaven, or that he had no power
on earth. Wife. But why God let you do so? Why he no
makee you good live?W. A. It is all our own sault.
Wife. But you say me he is great, much great, have
much great power, can makee kill when he will, why
he no makee kill when you no serve him? No say O
to him, no be good mans?
M 2 W. A.
W. A. That is true, he might strike me dead; and I
ought to expect it, for I have been a wicked wretch,
that is true; but God is merciful, and does not deal
with us as we deserve. Wife. But then do you not tell God thankee for that
too?W. A. No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his
mercy, any more than I have feared God for his
power. Wife. Then you God no God; me no think believe
he be such one, great much power, strong: no makee kill you, though you make him much angry. W. A. What, will my wicked life hinder you from
believing in God? What a dreadful creature am I! and
what a sad truth is it, that the horrid lives of Chris-
tians hinder the conversion of heathens!
Wife. How me think you have great much God up
there (she points up to heaven), and yet no do well,
no do good thing? Can he tell? Sure he no tell what
you do?
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think,
though we do not speak. Wife. What! he no hear you curse, swear, speak de great damn?W. A. Yes; yes; he hears it all.
Wife. Where be den de muchee great power strong?W. A. He is merciful, that is all we can say for it;
and this proves him to be the true God; he is God, and
not man, and therefore we are not consumed. Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with hor-
ror, to think how he could tell his wife so clearly that
God sees, and hears, and knows the secret thoughts of
of the heart, and all that we do, and yet that he had
dared to do all the vile things he had done.
Wife. Merciful! What you call that?W. A. He is our father and maker, and he pities and
spares us. Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry
when you do wicked; then he no good himself, or no
great able. W. A. Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and
infinitely great, and able to punish too; and sometimes,
to show his justice and vengeance, he lets fly his anger
to destroy sinners and make examples; many are cut off
in their sins. Wife. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you,
may be, that he no makee you kill; so you makee de bargain with him, you do bad thing, he no be angry
at you when he be angry at other mans. W. A. No, indeed; my sins are all presumptions upon
his goodness; and he would be infinitely just if he des-
troyed me, as he has done other men. Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead;
what you say to him for that? You no tell him thankee
for all that too?W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is
true.
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better?
You say he makee you. W. A. He made me, as he made all the world; it is I
have deformed myself and abused his goodness, and
made myself an abqminable wretch. ,
Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no makee
him angry, I no do bad wicked thing. M 3 Here
Here Will Atkins said his heart funk withfn him,
to hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to
know God, and he such a wicked wretch that he could
not say one word to her about God, but what the re-
proach of his own carriage would make most irrational
to her to believe; nay, that already she had told him that she could not believe in God, because he, that was
so wicked, was not destroyed. W.A. My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach
you to know God, not God to know you; for he
knows you already, and every thought in your heart. Wife. Why then he know what I say to you now;
he know me wish to know him; how shall me know
who makee me?
W. A. Poor creature! he must teach thee, I cannot
teach thee; I will pray to him to teach thee to know
him, and forgive me, that am unworthy to teach thee. The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring
him to make her know God, and her wishing to know
him, that he said he fell down on his knees before her,
and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with the sav-
ing knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon his sins,
and accept of his being the unworthy instrument of in-
structing her in the principles of religion: after which
he sat down by her again, and their dialogue went on.
1 N. B.This was the time when we saw him kneel
down, and hold up his hands. Wife. What you put down the knee for? What you
hold up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak
to? What is all that?W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my
submission to him that made me; I said O to him, as
you call it, and as you say,your old men do to their
idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to him. Wife. What you say O to him for? .
W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes, and your
understanding, that you may know him, and be accept-
ed by him. Wife. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things. Wife. But now he hear what you say?W.A. Yes; he has bid us pray to him, and promised
to hear us.
Wife. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid
you? What, you hear him speak?
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he has
revealed himself many ways to us. Here he was at a great loss to make her understand
that God has revealed himself to us by his word, and
what his word was; but at last he told it her thus:
W. A. God has spoken to some good men in former
days, even from heaven, by plain words; and God has
inspired good men by his Spirit; and they have written
all his laws down in a book.
Wife. Me no understand that; where is book?W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this book;
but I hope I shall one time or other get it for you, and
help you to read it. Here he embraced her with great affection; but with
inexpressible grief, that he had not a bible.
Wife. But how you makee me know that God
teachee them to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be
God.
Wife. What rule? What way you know him?
W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing
but what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to
M 4 make
make us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy; and
because he forbids, and commands us to avoid, all that is
wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its consequence. Wife. That me would understand, that me fain see: if he teachee all good thing, he makee all good thing,
he give all thing, he hear me when I say O to him, as
you do just now; he makee me good, if I wish be
good; he spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be
good: all this you say he do, yet he be great God; me.
take, think, believe him to be great God; me say O to
him with you, my dear. Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but
raised her up, made her kneel by him, and he prayed
to God aloud to instruct her in the knowledge of him-
self, by his Spirit; and that by some good providence, if
possible, she might some time or other come to have a,
bible, that she might read the word of God, and be
taught by it to know him. This was the time that we
saw him lift her up by the hand, and saw him kneel
down by her, as above. They had several other discourses, it seems, after this,
too long to be set down here; and particularly she made
him promise that since he confessed his own life had
been a wicked, abominable course of provocations against
God, that he would reform it, and not make God an-
gry any more; lest he should make him dead, as she called it, and then she would be left alone, and never
be taught to know this God better; and lest he should be miserable, as he had told her wicked men should be,
after death. This was a strange account, and very affecting to us
both, but particularly to the young clergyman; he was
indeed wonderfully surprised with it, but under the
greatest affliction imaginable that he could not talk to her,
169
her, that he could not speak English, to make her un-
derstand him; and as she spoke but very broken English,
he could not understand her; however, he turned him-
self to me, and told me that he believed that there must
be more to do with this woman than to marry her. I
did not understand him at first, but at length he explain-
ed himself, viz. that she ought to be baptized.
I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for
going about it presently. No, no; hold Sir, said he;
though I would have her be baptized by all means, yet
I must observe that Will Atkins, her husband, has
indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be wil-
ling to embrace a religious life, and has given her just
ideas of the being of a God; of his power, justice, and
mercy: yet I desire to know of him if he has said any
thing to her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sin-
ners; of the nature of faith in him, and redemption by
him; of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judg-
ement, and a future state. I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the
poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us he
had said something to her of all those things, but that
he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own con-
science so reproached him with his horrid, ungodly life,
that he trembled at the apprehensions that her know-
ledge of him should lessen the attention she should give
to those things, and make her rather contemn religion
than receive it; but he was assured, he said, that her
mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of all
those things, and that if I would but discourse with her,
she would make it appear to my satisfaction that my
labour would not be lost upon her.
Accordingly
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as in-
terpreter between my religious priest and the woman,
I entreated him to begin with her; but sure such a ser-
mon was never preached by a Popish priest, in these
latter ages of the world; and, as I told him, I thought
he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity
of a Christian, without the error of a Roman catholic; and that I took him to be such a clergyman as the Ro-
man bishops were, before the church of Rome assumed
spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men.
In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace
the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by him,
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did the
first notions of a God, but with joy and faith; with an
affection, and a surprising degree of understanding,
scarce to be imagined, much less to be expressed; and, at her own request, she was baptized.'
When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated
him that he would perform that office with somecaution>
that the man might not perceive he was of the Roman
church, if possible, because of other ill consequences
which might attend adifference among us in that very
religion which we were instructing the other in. He
told me, that as he had no consecrated chapel, nor pro-
per things for the office, I should see he would do it in
a manner that I should not know by it that he was a
Roman Catholic myself, if I had not known it before;
and so he did; for saying only some words over to him-
self in Latin, which I could not understand, he pour-
ed a whole dishful of water upon the woman's head,
pronouncing in French very loud, "Mary, "which was
the name her husband desired me to give her, for I was
her godfather, " 1 baptize thee in the name of the Father,

He gave the benediction afterwards in Latin, but either
Will Atkins did not know but it was French, or else
did not take notice of it at that time. As soon as this was over, we married them; and after the marriage was over, he turned to Will Atkins,
and in a very affectionate manner exhorted him, not on-
ly to persevere in that good disposition he was in, but
to support the convictions that were upon him by a re-
solution to reform his life; told him it was in vain to
say he repented if he did not forsake his crimes: re-
presented to him how God had honoured him with be-
ing the instrument of bringing his wife to the know-
ledge of the Christian religion, and that he should be
careful he did not dishonour the grace of God; and
that if he did, he would see the heathen a better Chris-
tian than himself; the savage converted, and the instru-
ment cast away. He said a great many good things to them both; and
then recommending them to God's goodness, gave them
the benediction again, I repeating every thing to them
in English; and thus ended the ceremony. I think it
was the most pleasant, jgreeable day to me that ever I
passed in my whole life. But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts
hung continually upon the conversion of the seven and
thirty savages, and fain he would have stayed upon the
island to have undertaken it; but I convinced him first,
that his undertaking was impracticable in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it into a way of be-
ing done in his absence to his satisfaction; of which

ADVENTURES OF
Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a nar-
row compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man I had taken out of the famished ship's company came to me, and told me he understood
I had a clergyman with me, and that I had caused the
Englishmen to be married to the savages; that he had
a match, too, which he desired might be finished before
I went, between two Christians, which he hoped would
not be disagreeable to me. I knew this must be the young woman who was his
mother's servant, for there was no other Christian wo-
man on the island: so I began to persuade him not to
do any thing of that kind rashly, or because he found
himself in this solitary circumstance. I represented to
him that he had some considerable substance in the
world, and good friends, as I understood by himself,
and the maid also; that the maid was not only poor,
and a servant, but was unequal to him, she being six or
seven and twenty years old, and he not above seventeen
or eighteen; that he might very probably, with my as-
sistance, make a remove from this wilderness, and come
into his own country again; and that then it would be a
thousand to one but he would repent his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance might be disadvantage-
ous to both. I was going to say more, but he inter-
rupted, smiling, and told me, with a great deal of mo-
desty, that I mistook in my guesses > that he had no-
thing of that kind in his thoughts; and he was very
glad to hear that I had an intent of putting them in a
way to see their own country again; and nothing should
have put him upon staying there, but that the voyage
I was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends; that
that he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would
settle him in some little property in the island where he
was, give him a servant or two, and some few necessa-
ries, and he would settle himself here like a planter,
waiting the good time when, if ever I returned to Eng-
land, I would redeem them; and hoped I would not be
unmindful of him when I came to England: that he
would give me some letters to his friends in London,
to let them know how good I had been to him, and in
what part of the world, and what circumstance I had
left him in; and he promised me that whenever I re-
deemed him, the plantation, and all the improvements
he had made upon it, let the value be what it would,
should be wholly mine. His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering
his youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because
he told me positively the match was not for himself.
I gave him all possible assurances that if I lived to come
safe to England, I would deliver his letters, and do his
business effectually; and that he might depend I should
never forget the circumstances I had left him in: but
still I was impatient to know who was the person to
be married; upon which he to!d me, it was my Jack
of all trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably
surprised when he named the match; for indeed I
thought it very suitable. The character of that man I
have given already; and as for the maid, she was a very
honest, modest, sober, and religious young woman;
had a very good share of sense, was agreeable enough
in her person, spoke very handsomely, and to the pur-
pose, always with decency and good manners, and nei-
ther too backward to speak, when requisite, nor imper-
tinently forward, when it was not her business; very handy
handy and housewifely, an excellent manager, fit fa-
"deed to have been governess to the whole island, and
she knew very well how to behave in every respect. The match being proposed in this manner, we mar-
ried them the same day; and as I was father at the altar,
as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave her a por-
tion; for I appointed her and her husband a handsome large space of ground for their plantation; and indeed
this match, and the proposal the young gentleman
made to give him a small property in the island, put
me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that they
might not quarrel afterwards about their situation. This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who was now grown a sober, grave, managing
fellow, perfectly reformed, exceedingly pious and reli-
gious, and, as far as I may be allowed to speak positive-
ly in such a case, I verily believe he was a true peni-
tent. He divided things so justly, and so much to every
one's satisfaction, that they only desired one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I caused
to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, setting
out the bounds and situation of every man's plantation,
and testifying that I gave them thereby severally a right
to the whole possession and inheritance of the respective
plantations or farms, with their improvements, to
them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island
as my own property, and a certain rent for every par-
ticular plantation after eleven years, if I, or any one
from me, or in my name, came to demand it, produ-
cing an attested copy of the same writing. 175
As to the government and laws among them, I told
them I was not capable of giving them better rules than
they were able to give themselves; only I made them
promise me to live in love and good neighbourhood
with one another; and so I prepared to leave them. One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much business in hand, it was but
odd to have seven and thirty Indians live in a nook of
the island, independent, and indeed unemployed; for,
excepting the providing themselves food, which they
had difficulty enough in too, sometimes they had no
manner of business or property to manage. I proposed
therefore to the governor Spaniard, that he should go
to them, with Friday's father, and propose to them to
remove, and either plant for themselves, or take them
into their several families as servants, to be maintained for their labour, but without being absolute slaves; for
I would not admit them to make them slaves by force,
by any means; because theyTiad their liberty given them
by capitulation, as it were articles of surrender, which
they ought not to break. They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very cheerful along with him; so we allotted
them land, and plantations, which three or four ac-
cepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed as ser-
vants in the several families we had settled; and thus
my colony was in a manner settled, as follows :—The
Spaniards possessed my original habitation, which was
the capital city, and extended their plantations all along
the side of the brook, which made the creek that I have
so often described, as far as my bower; and as they
increased their culture, it went always eastward. The English
\
English lived in the north-east part, where Will. Aukins and his comrades began, and came on southward and south-west, towards the back part of the Spaniards f
and every plantation had a great addition of land to take
in, if they found occasion, so that they need not jostle
one another for want of room. All the east end of the island was left uninhabited, that if any of the savages should come on shore there
only for their usual customary barbarities, they might
come and go; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would
disturb them: and no doubt but they were often
ashore, and went away again, for I never heard that the
planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more. It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to
my friend the clergyman that the work of converting
the savages might perhaps be set on foot in his absence
to his satissaction; and told him that now I thought it
was put in a fair way; for the savages being thus divided
among the Christians, if they would but every one of
them do their part with those which came under their
hands, I hoped it might have a very good effect. He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do'
their part; but how, says he, shall we obtain that of
them? I told him we would call them all together, and
leave it in charge with them, or go to them, one by one,
which he thought best: so we divided it, he to speak to
the Spaniards, who were all papists, and I to the Eng-
lish, who were all Protestants; and we recommended it
earnestly to them, and made them promise that they
would never make any distinction of papist or protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians, but
teach them the general knowledge of the true God,
and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise pro-
promised us that they would never have any differences
or disputes one with another about religion. When I came to Will Atkins's house, (I may call it
so, for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I
believe, was not standing in the world again) there I
found the young woman I have mentioned above, and
Will Atkins's wife were become intimates; and this
prudent, religious young woman, had perfected the work
Will Atkins had begun; and though it was not above
four days after what I have related, yet the new bap-
tized savage woman was made such a Christian as I have
seldom heard of in all my observation or conversation
in the world. It came next into my mind, in the morning before
I went to them, that amongst all the needful things I
had to leave with them, I had not left them a Bible, in
which I showed myself less considering for them than
my good friend the widow was for me, when she sent
me the cargo of a hundred pounds from Lisbon,
where she packed up three Bibles and a prayer-book.
However, the good woman's charity had a greater extent
than ever she imagined, for they were reserved for the
comfort and instruction of those that made much better
use of them than I had done. I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I
came to Will Atkins's tent, or house, and found the
young woman and Atkins's baptized wife had been dis-
coursing of religion together, for Will Atkins told it
me with a great deal of joy, I asked if they were together
now, and he said yes; so I went into the house, and
he with me, and we found them together very earnest
in discourse. O, Sir, says Will Atkins, when God has
sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to bring hom«

ADVENTURES OF
he never wants a messenger; my wife has got a new
instructor; I knew I was as unworthy as I was incapable
of that work; that young woman has been sent hither
from heaven; she is enough to convert a whole island
of savages. The young woman blushed, and rose up
to go away, but I desired her to sit still; I told her she
had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped God
would bless her in it. We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any book among them, though I did not ask: but I
put my hand into my pocket, and pulled out my bible:
Here, says I to Atkins, I have brought you an assistant
that perhaps you had not before. The man was so con-
founded that he was not able to speak for some time;
but recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands,
and turning to his wife, Here, my dear, says he, did
not I tell you our God, though he lives above, could
hear what we said? Here's the book I prayed for when
you and I kneeled down under the bush; now God has
heard us, and sent it. When he had said so, the man
fell into such transports of passionate joy, that be-
tween the joy of having it, and giving God thanks for
it, the tears ran down his sacelike a child that was crying. The woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of, for
she firmly believed God had sent the book upon her
husband's petition. It is true, that providentially it was
so, and might be taken so in a consequent sense; but
I believe it would have been no difficult matter, at that
time, to have persuaded the poorwoman to have believed
that an express messenger came from heaven on purpose
to bring that individual book; but it was too serious a
matter to suffer any delusion to take place; so I turned to
179
to the young woman, and told her we did not desire to
impose upon the new convert, in her first and more ig-
norant understanding of things, and begged her to ex-
plain to her that God may be very properly said to
answer our petitions, when, in the course of his provi-
dence, such things are in a particular manner brought to
pass as we petitioned for; but we did not expect returns
from Heaven in a miraculous and particular manner,
and it is our mercy that it is not so. This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so
that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used here; and
I should have thought it one of the most unjustifiable
frauds in the world to have had it so: but the surprise of
joy upon Will Atkins is really not to be expressed; and
there, we may be sure there was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful in the world for any thing
of its kind than he was for the Bible; nor, I believe,
never any man was glad of a Bible from a better principle;
and though he had been a most profligate creature,
headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet this
man is a standing rule to us all for the well instructing
children, viz. that parents should never give over to
teach and instruct, nor ever despair of the success of their
endeavours, let the children be ever so refractory, or,
to appearance, insensible of instruction; for, if ever
God, in his providence, touches the conscience of
such, the force of their education returns upon them,
and the early instruction of parents is not lost, though
it may have been many years laid asleep, but, some
time or other, they may find the benefit of it. Thus
it was with this poor man; however ignorant he
was of religion and Christian knowledge, he found he
had some to do with now more ignorant than himself,
and that the least part of the instruction of his good sa-
ther, that now came to his mind was of use to him. N % Among
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his
father used to insist so much on the inexpressible value
of the Bible, the privilege and blessing of it to nations, families, and persons; but he never entertained the least
notion of the worthof it till now, when being to talk to
heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help
of the written oracle for his assistance. The young woman was glad of it also for the present
occasion, though she had one, and so had the youth,
on board our ship, among their goods, which were not
yet brought on shore. And now having said so many
things of this young woman, I cannot omit telling one
story more of her and myself, which has something in
it very informing and remarkable. I have related to what extremity the poor young wo-
man was reduced, how her mistress was starved to death,
and died on board that unhappy ship we met at sea, and
how the whole ship's company was reduced to the last
extremity. The gentlewoman and her son, and this
maid, were first hardly used, as to provisions, and at last
totally neglected and starved; that is to say, brought to
the last extremity of hunger.—One day, being discoursing with her on the extre-
mities they suffered, I asked her if she could describe,
by what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it
appeared? She told me she believed she could, and
she told her tale very distinctly, thus:
First, Sir, said she, we had for some days sared ex-
ceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger; but 'at
last, we were wholly without food of any kind, except
sugar, and a little wine and water. The first day, after
I had received no food at all, I found myself, towards
evening, first empty and sick at the stomach, and nearer
nearer night much inclined to yawning and sleep. I
laid down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep, and
slept about three hours, and awaked a little refreshed,
having taken a glass of wine when I lay down: after
being about three hours awake, it being about five
o'clock in the morning, I found myself empty, and my
stomach sickish, and lay down again, but could not
sleep at all, being very faint and ill; and thus I con-
tinued all the second day, with a strange variety, first
hungry, then sick again, with Teachings to vomit. The
second night, being obliged to go to bed again without
any food, more than a draught of fresh water, and being
asleep, I dreamed I was at Baibadoes, and that the
market was mightily stocked with provisions; that I
bought some for my mistress, and went and dined very
heartily. I thought my stomach was as full after this as it
would have been after a good dinner; but when I
awaked, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find
myself in the extremity of famine. The last glass of
wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of
its having some spirit to supply nourishment; but there
being no substance in the stomach for the digesting of-
fice to work upon, I found the only effect of the wine
was, to raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach into
the head; and I lay, as they told me, stupid and sense-
less, as one drunk, for some time.
° The third day, in the morning, after a night of
strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather
dozing than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious
with hunger; and I question, had not my understand-
ing returned and conquered it, I say, I question whe-
N 3 ther,
ADVENTURES OF
ther, if I had been a mother, and had had a little child
with me, its life would have been safe or not. This lasted about three hours; during which time I
was twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my
young master told me, and as he can now inform you. In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction, 1 fell
down, and struck my face against the corner of a pallet bed, in which my mistress lay, and, with the blow, the
blood gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bring-
ing me a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great
deal; and as the blood came from me, I came to myself,
and the violence of the flame or fever I was in abated,
and so did the ravenous part of the hunger. Then I grew sick, and reached to vomit, but could
not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up.
After I had bled some time, I swooned, and they all be-
lieved I was dead; but I came to myself soon after, and
then had a most dreadful pain in my stomach, not to be
described, not like the cholic, but a gnawing, eager
pain for food; and towards the night it went off, with a
kind of earnest wishing or longing for food, something
like, as I suppose, thelonging of a woman with child.
I took another draught of water, with sugar in it; but
my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all up
again: then I took a draught of water without sugar,
and that stayed with me; and I laid me down upon the
bed, praying most heartily that it would please God to
take me away; and composing my mind in hopes of it,
I slumbered awhile, and then waking, thought myself
dying, being light with vapours from an empty sto-
mach; 1 recommended my soul then to God, and ear-
nestly wished that somebody would throw me into the
sea.
All
All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought,
expiring, but bore it with much more patience than I;
gave the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my
young master, who would not have taken it, but she
obliged him to eat it; and I believe it saved his life. Towards the morning I slept again; and when I
awoke, I fell into a violent passion of crying, and after
that had a second fit of violent hunger; I got up raven-
ous, and in a most dreadful condition: had my mistress
been dead, as much as I loved her, I am certain I
should have eaten a piece of her flesh with as much re-
lish, and as unconcerned, as ever I did eat the flesh of
any creature appointed for food; and once or twice I
was going to bite my own arm: at last I saw the basin in which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day
before; I ran to it, and swallowed it with such haste,
and such a greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had
taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from me
now.
Though aster it was down, the thoughts of it filled
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, and I
drank a draught of water, and was composed and
refreshed for some hours after. This was the fourth
day; and thus I held it, 'till towards night; when, with-
in the compass of three hours, I had all the several cir-
cumstances over again, one after another, viz. sick,
sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach, then ra-
venous again; then sick, then lunatic, then crying,
then ravenous again, and so every quarter of an hour; and my strength wasted exceedingly: at night I laid me
down, having no comfort but in the hope that I should
die before morning.
All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now
turned into a disease; and I had a terrible cholic and N * griping,
^griping, by wind, instead of food, having found its way
into the bowels; and in this condition I lay till morn-
ing, when I was surprised with the cries and lamenta-
tions of my young master, who called out to me that
his mother was dead: I lifted myself up a little, for I
had not strength to rise, but found she was not dead,
though she was able to give very little signs of life.
I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want
of some sustenance, that I cannot describe; with such
frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that nothing but
the tortures of death can imitate; and in this condition
I was when I heard the seamen above cry out, A sail! a
sail! and holla and jump about as if they were distracted. I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mis-
tress much less; and my young master was so sick, that
I thought he had been expiring; so we could not open
the cabin-door, or get any account what it was that oc-
casioned such a combustion, nor had we any conversa-
tion with the ship's company for two days, they hav-
ing told us that they had not a mouthful of any thing
to eat in the ship; and they told us afterwards, they
thought we had been dead. It was this dreadful condition we were in when you
were sent to save our lives; and how you found us, Sir,
you know as well as I, and better too. This was her own relation, and is such a distinct ac-
count of starving to death, as, I confess, I never met
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me. I am the
rather apt to believe it to be a true account, because
the youth gave me an account of a good part of it;
though, I must own, not so distinct and so feeling as
the maid; and the rather, because it seems his mother
fed hinfat the price of her own life; but the poor maid, though
185
though her constitution being stronger than that of her
mistress, who was in years, and a weakly woman too,
she might struggle harder with it; I say, the poor maid
might be supposed to feel the extremity something sooner
than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the
last bit something longer than she parted with any to
relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here rela-
ted, if our ship, or some other, had not so providen-
tially met them, a few days more-would have ended all their lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one
another; and that even, as their case stood, would have
served them but a little while, they being five hundred-
leagues from any land, or any possibility of relief, other
than in the miraculous manner it happened: but this
is by the way; I return to my disposition of things
among the people.
And first, it is to be observed here, that for many-
reasons, I did not think fit to let them know any thing
of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought of set-
ting up among them; for I found, at least at my first
coming, such seeds of divisions among them, that I saw
plainly, had I setup the sloop, and left it among them,
they would, upon every light disgust, have separated, and gone away from one another, or perhaps have turned
pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves, instead
of a plantation of sober and religious people, as Tin-
tended it; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass can-
non that I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns
that my nephew took extraordinary, for the same rea-
son: I thought it was enough to qualify them for a de-
fensive war against any that should invade them, but
not to set them up for an offensive war, or to go abroad
to attack others; which, in the end, would only bring ruin
ruin and destruction upon them: I reserved the sloop,
therefore, and the guns, for their service another way, as I shall observe in its place. Having now done with the island, I left them all in
good circumstances and in a flourishing condition, and
went on board my ship again the 6th of May, having
been about five and twenty days among them; and as
they were all resolved to stay upon the island till I came to remove them, I promised to send them farther relief
from the Brazils, if I could possibly find an opportu-
nity: and particularly I promised to send them some
cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and cows; as to the two
cows and calves which I brought from England, we
had been obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill
them at sea, for want of hay to feed them. The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at
parting, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints,
in the Brazils, in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this: that about
three days after we had sailed, being becalmed, and the
current setting strong to the E. N. E. running, as it
were, into a bay orgulph on the land side, we were driven something out of our course, and once or twice our
men cried, land to the eastward; but whether it was the
continent or islands we could not tell by any means. But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth,
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, covered
towards the land with something very black; not be-
ing able to discover what it was, till after some time,
our chief mate going up the main-shrouds a little way,
and looking at them with a perspective, cried out it
was an army. I could not imagine what he meant by
an army, and thwarted him a little hastily: Nay, Sir,
fays
187
fays he, don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet
too; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, and you
may see them paddle along, for they are coming to-
wards us apace. I was a little surprized then indeed, and so was my
nephew the captain; for he had heard such terrible
stories of them in the island, and having never been in
those seas before, that he could not tell what to think
of it, but said, two or three times, we should all be
devoured. I must confess, considering we were be-
calmed, and the current set strong towards the shore,
I liked it the worse: however, I bade them not be afraid,
but bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so
near to know that we must engage them. The weather continued calm, and they came on
apace towards us; so I gave order to come to an an-
chor, and furl all our sails: as for the savages, I told
them they had nothing to fear but fire, and therefore
they should get their boats out, and fasten them, one
close by the head, and the other by the stern, and man
them both well, and wait the issue in that posture: this
I did, that the men in the boats might be ready with
sheets and buckets to put out any fire these savages
would endeavour to fix to the outside of the ship. In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little
while they came up with us; but never was such a
horrid sight seen by Christians: though my mate was
much mistaken in his calculation of their number, yet
when they came up we reckoned about a hundred and
twenty-six; some of them had sixteen or seventeen men
in them, and some more, and the least six or seven. When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which
ADVENTURES OP
which they haddoubtless never seen before; nor could
they, at first, as we afterwards understood, know what
to make of us; they came boldly up, however, very near
to us, and seemed to go about to row round us; but
we called to our men in the boats not to let them come
too near them. This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six of the
large canoes came so near our long-boat that our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which
they understood very well, and went back, but at their
retreat about fifty arrows came on board us from those
boats, and one of our men in the longboat was very
much wounded. However, I called to them not to fire by any means;
but we handed down some deal-boards into the boat,
and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence, like
waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of the sa-
vages, if they should shoot again. About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a
body astern of us, and so near, as that we could easily
discern what they were, though we could not tell their
design; and I easily found they were some of my old
friends, the same sort of savages that I had been used to
engage with; and in a short time more they rowed a
little farther out to sea, till they came directly broadside
with us,and then rowed down straight upon us, till
they came so near that they could hear us speak: upon
this I ordered all my men to keep close,lest they should
shootanymore arrows, and made all our guns ready; but
being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday
go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his
language, to know what they meant; which accordingly he
he did. Whether they understood him or not, that I
knew not; but as soon as he had called to them, six of
them, who were in the foremost or nighest boat to us,
turned their canoes from us, and stooping down, showed us their naked backsides, just as if, in English, saving your presence, they had bid us kiss :whether this was a defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether
it was done in mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest;
but immediately Friday cried out they were going to
shoot; and unhappily for him, poor fellow, they let fly
about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my inex-
pressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being
in their sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less
than three arrows, and about three more fell very near
him; such unlucky marksmen they were!I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant
and companion, that I immediately ordered five guns to
be loaded with small-shot, and four with great, and
gave them such a broadside as they had never heard in
their lives before, to befure. They were not above
half a cable length off when we fired; and our gunners
took their aim so well that three or sour'of their canoes
were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot only. The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to
us gave us no great offence; neither did I know for
certain whether that which would pass for the great-
est contempt among us might be understood so by
them or not; therefore, in return, I had only resol-
ved to have fired four or five guns at them with powder
only, which I knew would fright them suffitiently:
but when they shot at us directly, with all the fury they
were capable of, and especially as they had killed my poor
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and
who indeed so well deserved it, I thought myself not
only justifiable before God and man, but would have
been very glad if I could have overset every canoe there,
and drowned every one of them. I can neither tell how many we killed or how many
we wounded, at this broadside, but sure such a fright
and hurry never was seen among such amultitude; there
were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and over-
set in all, and the men all set a swimming: the rest,
frightened out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they
could, taking but little care to save those whose boats
were split or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose they
were many of them lost; and our men took up one
poor fellow swimming for his life, above an hour after
they were all gone.
Our small-shot from our cannon must needs kill and
wound a great many; but, in short, we never knew
any thing how it went with them, for they fled so fast, that in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not see above three or four straggling canoes, nor did we ever
see the rest any more; fora breeze of wind springing up
the same evening, we weighed, and set sail for the
Brazils. We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so
sullen that he would neither eat nor speak, and we aH
sancied he would starve himself to death: but I took
away to cure him; for I made them take him and turn
him into the long-boat, and make him believe they
would toss him into the sea again, and so leave him
where they found him, if he would not speak: nor
would that do, but they really did throw him into the sea,
and came away from him; and then he followed them, for
for he swam like a cork, and called to them, in his
tongue, though they knew not one word of what he
said: however, at last they took him in again, and then
he began to be more tractable; nor did I ever design
they should drown him. We were now under sail again; but I was the most
disconsolate creature alive for want of my man Friday,
and would have been very glad to have gone back to
the island to have taken one of the rest from thence for
my occasion; but it could not be; so we went on. We
had one prisoner, as I have said, and it was a long time
before we could make him understand any thing; but,
in time, our men taught him some English, and he be-
gan to be a little tractable. Afterwards, we inquired what country he came from, but could make nothing
of what he said; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals,
and he spoke in the throat in such a hollow, odd man-
ner, that we could never form a word after him; and
we were all of opinion that they might speak that lan-
guage as well if they were gagged as otherwise; nor
could we perceive that they had any occasion either for
teeth, tongue, lips, orpalate, but formed their words just
as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an open throat. He
told us, however, some time after, when we had taught
him to speak a little English, that they were going with
their kings to sight a great battle. When he said
kings, we asked him how many kings? He said they
were five nation: (we could not make him understand
the plural s), and that they all joined to go against two
nation. We asked him what made them come up to
us? He said to makee te great wonder look: where, it is
to be observed, that all those natives, as also those of
Africa, when they learn English, always add two V*
at the end of the words where we use one; and they
place the accent upon them, as makee, takee, and the
like; and we could not break them of it; nay, I could
hardly make Friday leave it off, though at last he did. And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must
take my last leave of him: Poor honest Friday! We
buried him with all the decency and solemnity possible,
by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him into
the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns for him:
and so ended the life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant, that ever man had.
We went now away with a fair wind for Brasil; and
in about twelve days time, we made land, in the latitude
of five degrees south of the line, being the north easter-most land of all that part of America. We kept on S.by E.in sight of the shore four days, when we made
Cape St. Augustine, and in three days came to an
anchor off the bay of All Saints, the old place of my de-
liverance, from whence came both my good and evil
fate. Never ship came to this port that had less business
than I had, and yet it was with great difficulty that we
were admitted to hold the least correspondence on
shore: not my partner himself, who was alive, and
made a great figure among them, not my two merchant-trustees, not the fame of my wonderful preservation in
the island, could obtain me that savour: but my part-
ner remembering that I had given five hundred moidores to the prior of the monastery of the Augustines,
and two hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to
the monastery, and obliged the prior that then was, to go
to the governor, and get leave for me personally, with the
captain and one more, besides eight seamen, to come on
5 shore,
shore, and no more; and this upon condition absolutely
capitulated for, that we should not offer to land any
goods out of the ship, or to carry any person away
without licence. They were so strict with us as to landing any goods,
that it was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore
three bales of English goods, such as fine broad-cloths,
- stuffs, and some linen, which I had brought for a pre-
sent to my partner. He was a very generous, open-hearted man; though,
like me, he came from little at first: and though he
knew not that I had the least design of giving him any
thing, he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions,
wine and sweet-meats, worth above thirty moidores,
including some tobacco, and three or four fine medals
of gold: but I was even with him in my present, which,
as I have said, consisted of fine broad-cloth, English
stuffs, lace, and fine hollands; also I delivered him
about the value of 100I. sterling, in the same goods, for
other uses; and I obliged him to set up the sloop, which
I had brought with me from England, as I have said,
for the use of my colony, in order to send the refresh-
ments I intended to my plantation.
Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop in
a very few days, for she was already framed; and I gave
the master of her such instructions as he could not miss
the place; nor did he miss them, as I had an account
from my partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded
with the small cargo I sent them; and one of our sea-
men, that had been on shore with me there, offered to
go with the sloop and settle there, upon my letter to
the governor Spaniard to allot him a sufficient quan-
tity of land for a plantation, and giving him some Vol. II. O cloaths
ADVENTURES OF
cloaths and tools for his planting-work, which he said
he understood, having been an old planter at Maryland,
and a buccaneer into the bargain. I encouraged the fellow, by granting all he desired;
and, as in condition, I gave him the savage whom we
had taken prisoner of war to be his slave, and or-
dered the governor Spaniard to give him his share of
every thing he wanted with the rest. When we came to fit this man out, my old partner
told me there was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen into the
displeasure of the church. I know not what the matter
is with him, says he; but, on my conscience I think he
is a heretic in his heart, and he has been obliged to con-
ceal himself for fear of the Inquisition; that he would
be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and two daughters; and if I would let them
go to my island, and allot them a plantation, he would
give them a small stock to begin with; for the officers
of the Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate,
and he had nothing left but a little household stuff, and
two staves: and, adds he, though I hate his principles,
yet I would not have him fall into their hands, for h$
would be assuredly burned alive if he does. I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman
with them; and we concealed the man, and his wife
and daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop put out
to go to sea; and then, having put all their goods on
board some time before, we put them on board the sloop after she was got out of the bay. Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new part-
ner; and their stocks indeed were much alike rich in
tools, in preparations, and a farm; but nothing to be-
gin.
gin with, except as above: however, they carried over with
them, which was worth all the rest, some materials for
planting sugar-canes, with some plants of canes, which
he, I mean the Portugal man, understood very well. Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants inths
island, I sent them by the sloop three milch cows and
five calves, about twenty-two hogs among them, three
sows big with pig, two mares, and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I en-
gaged three Portugal women to go, and recommended
it to them to marry them, and use them kindly. I
could have procured more women, but I remembered
that the poor prosecuted man had two daughters, and
there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted; the rest
had wives of their own, though in another country. All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily sup-
pose, was very welcome to my old inhabitants, who
were now, with this addition, between sixty and seventy
people, besides little children, of which there were a
great many. I found letters at London from them all,
by way of Lisbon, when I came back to England, of
which I shall also take some notice immediately. I have now done with the island, and all manner of
discourse about.it; and whoever reads the rest of my
memorandums would do well to turn his thoughts en-
tirely from it, and expect to read of the follies of an
old man, not warned by his own harms, much less by
those of other men, to beware of the like; not cooled
by almost forty years miseries and disappointments; not
satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation, nor made
cautious by afflictions and distress beyond imitation. I had no more business to goto the East Indies than
a man at full liberty has to go to the turnkey at NewO 2, gate,
gate, and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners
there, and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from
England, and gone directly to the island; had I loaded
her, as I did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for
the plantation, and for my people; taken a patent from
the government here to have secured my property, in
subjection only to that of England; had I carried over
cannon and ammunition, servants, and people to plant,
and taken possession of the place, fortified and strength-
ened it in the name of England, and increased it with
people, as I might easily have done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the ship back laden with good
rice, as I might also have done in fix months time, and
ordered my friends to have fitted her out again for our
supply; had I done this, and stayed there myself, I had
at least acted like a man of common sense: but I was
possessed with a wandering spirit, scorned all advantages: I pleased myself with being the patron of the people I
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty,
majestic way, like an old patriarchal monarch, providing
for them as if I had been father of the whole family, as
well as of the plantation: but I never so much as pre-
tended to plant in the name of any government or na-
tion, or to acknowledge any prince, or to call my peo-
ple subjects to any one nation more than another; naj,
I never so much as gave the place a name, but left it, as I found it, belonging to nobody, and the people under no discipline or government but my own; who,
though I had influence over them as a father and bene-
factor, had no authority or power to act or command
one way or other, farther than voluntary consent mov-
ed them to comply :. yet even this, had I stayed there,
would have done well enough; but as I rambled from them.

them, and came there no more, the last letters I had
from any of them was by my partner's means, who af-
terwards sent another sloop to the place, and who sent
me word, though I had not the letter till I got to Lon-
don, several years after it was written, that they went
on but poorly, were malcontent with their long stay
there; that Will Atkins was dead; that five of the
Spaniards were come away; and though they had not
been much molested by the savages, yet they had some
skirmishes with them; and that they begged of him to
write to me to think of the promise I had made to fetch
them away, that they might see their country again be-
fore they died. But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed! and they
that will have any more of me must be content to sol 'low me into a new variety of follies, hardships, and
wild adventures, wherein the justice of Providence may
be duly observed; and we may see how easily Heaven
can gorge us with our own desires, make the strongest
of our wishes be our affliction, and punish us most se-
verely with those very things which we think it would
be our utmost happiness to be allowed in. Whether I had
business or no business, away I went: 'tis no time now
to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of my own con-
duct, but to come to the history; I was embarked for
the voyage, and the voyage I went. I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest
popish clergyman; for let their opinion of us, and all
other heretics in general, as they call us, be as uncha-
ritable as it may, I verily believe this man was very sin-
cere, and wished the good of all men: yet I believe he
was upon the reserve in many of his expressions, to pre-
vent giving me offence; for I scarce heard him once call 0 3 oa
ADVENTURES OP
on the blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jago or his
guardian angel, though so common with the rest of
them; however, I say, I had not the least doubt of his
sincerity and pious intentions on his own part; and I
am firmly of opinion, if the rest of the popish missiona-
ries were like him, they would strive to visit even the
poor Tartars and Laplanders, where they have nothing
to give them, as well as covet to flock to India, Persia,
China, &c. the most wealthy of the heathen countries;
for if they expected to bring no gains to their church by
it, it may well be admired how they came to admit the
Chinese Confucius into the calendar of the Christian
saints. But this by the bye. A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, I say,my pi-
ous priest asked me leave to go thither; being still, as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he began.
How happy had it been for me if 1 had gone with him!
But it was too late how; all things Heaven appoints for
the best: had I gone with him, I had never had so many
things to be thankful for, and you had never heard of
the second part of the travels and adventures of Robin-
son Crusoe; so I must here leave exclaiming at myself,
and go on with my voyage. From the Brazils we made
directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good
Hope, and had a tolerable good voyage, our course ge-
nerally south-east, now and then a storm, and some
contrary winds, but my disasters at sea were at an end;
my future rubs and cross events were to befall me on
shore, that it might appear the land was as well prepa-
red to be our scourge as the sea. Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a super-
cargo on board, who was to direct all her motions after
she arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a certain number
199
number of days for stay, by charter-party, at the several
ports she was to go to. This was none of my business,
neither did meddle with it; my nephew, the captain, and
the supercargo, adjusting all those things between them
as they thought fit.
We stayed at the Cape no longer than was needful to
take in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the
coast of Coromandel. We were indeed informed that
a French man of war of fifty guns, and two large mer-
chant ships were gone for the Indies; and as I knew
we were at war with France, I had some apprehensions
of them; but they went their own way, and we heard no
more of them. I shall not pester my account orthe reader with a tedious description of places, journals of our voyages,
variations of the compass, latitudes, trade-winds, Sec;
it is enough to name the ports and places which we
touched at, and what occurred to us upon our pasting
from one to another. We touched first at the island of
Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and
treacherous, and in particular,very well armed wjth'
lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable
dexterity, yet we fared very well with them awhile;
they treated us very civilly, and for some trifles which
we gave them, such as knives, scissars, &c. they
brought us eleven good fat bullocks of a middling size,
which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our
present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use. We were obliged to stay here some time after we had
furnished ourselves with provisions; and I, who was al-
ways too curious to look into every nook of the world
wherever I came, was for going on shore as often as..J
could. It was on the east side of the island that we went
O 4 on
on shore one evening; and the people, who, by the
way, are very numerous, came thronging about us, and
stood gazing at us at a distance; but as we had traded
freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the people, we
cut three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a
distance from us; which, it seems, is a mark in that
country, not only of a truce and friendship, but when
it is accepted, the other side sets up three poles or boughs,
which is a signal that they accept the truce too; but
, then this is a known condition of the truce too, that
you are not to pass beyond their three poles, towards
them, nor they to come past your three poles, or
boughs, towards you; so that you are perfectly secure
within the three poles, and all the space between your
poles and theirs is allowed like a market for free con-
verse, traffic, and commerce. When you go there, you
must not carry your weapons with you; and if they
come into that space, they stick up their javelins and
lances all at the first poles, and come on unarmed; but
if any violence is offered them, and the truce thereby
broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of
their weapons, and the truce is at an end. It happened one evening when we went on shore, that a greater number of their people came down than
usual, but all very friendly and civil; and they brought
several kinds of provisions, for which we satisfied
them with such toys as we had -, their women also
brought us milk and roots, and several things very
acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made us a
little tent or hut of some boughs of trees, and lay on
shore all night. I know
I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so
well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the boat
riding at an anchor about a stone-cast from the land,
with two men in her to take care of her, I made one of
them come on shore; and getting some boughs of trees
to cover us also in the boat, I spread the sail on the
bottom of the boat, and lay under the cover of the
branches of trees all night in the boat. About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of
our men make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out,
for God's sake, to bring the boat in, and come and help
them, for they were all like to be murdered; at the
same time I heard the fire of five muskets, which was
the number of the guns they had, and that three times
over; for, it seems, the natives here were not so easily
frightened with guns as the savages were in America,
where I had to do with them. All this while I knew not what was the matter, but
rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I cau-
sed the boat to be thrust in, and resolved with three
fusees we had on board, to land and assist our men. We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were
in too much haste; for being come to the shore, they
plunged into the water, to get to the boat with all the
expedition they could, being pursued by between three
and four hundred men. Our men were but nine in all,
and only five of them had fusees with them; the rest
had pistols and swords, but they were of smalluse to them. We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; and
that which was still worse was, that while we stood in
the boat to take our men in, we were in as much danger as
as they were in on shore; for they poured their arrows
in upon us so thick, that we were glad to barricade the
side of the boat up with the benches, and two or three
loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we had by
mere accident in the boat. And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems,
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen but
the least part of any of us, they would have been sure of
us; we had, by the light of the moon, a little sight of
them, as they stood pelting us from the shore with
darts and arrows; and having got ready our fire-arms,
we gave them a volley, that we could hear, by the cries
of some of them, that wehad wounded several; how-
ever, they stood thus in battle array on the shore till
break of day, which we suppose was that they might see the better to take their aim at us. In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to
weigh our anchor or set up our sail, because we must
needs stand up in the boat, and they were as sure to hit
us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot. We
made signals of distress to the ship, which, though she
rode a league off, yet my nephew the captain, hearing
our firing, and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay
in, and that we fired towards the shore, pretty well
understood us; and weighing anchor with all speed, he
stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and
then sent another boat, with ten hands in her, to assist
us: but we called to them not to come too near, telling
them what condition we were in; however, they stood
in near to us, and one of the men taking the end of a
tow-line in his hand, and keeping one boat between
him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to the boat;
boat; upon which we'slipped out a little cable, and
leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out of reach
of the arrows; we all the while lying close behind the
barricado we had made. As soon as we were got from between the ship and
the shore, that we could lay her side to the shore, she run along just by them, and poured in a broadside among
them loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets,
and such stuff, besides the great shot, which made a
terrible havoc among them. When we were got on board and out of danger, we
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray; and
indeed our supercargo, who had been often in those
parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure the in-
habitants would not have touched us after we had made
a truce, if we had not done something to provoke them
to it: at length it came out, viz. that an old woman,
who had come to sell us some milk, had brought it
within our poles, and a young woman with her, who
also brought some roots or herbs; and while the old
woman (whether she was mother to the young woman
or no they could not tell) was selling us the milk, one
of our men offered some rudeness to the wench that was
with her, at which the old woman made a great noise:
however, the seaman would not quit his prize, but car-
ried her out of the old woman's sight among the trees,
it being almost dark: the old woman went away with-
out her, and, as we may suppose, made an outcry among
the people she came from; who, upon notice, raised this
great army upon us in three or four hours; and it was
great odds but we had all been destroyed. One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at
him just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out
ADVENTURES OF
out of the tent they had made: the rest came off free,
all but the fellow who was the occasion of all the mis-
chief, who paid dear enough for his black mistress, for we could not hear what became of him a great while.
We lay upon the shore two days after, though the wind
presented, and made signals for him, and made our boat
sail up shore and down shore several leagues, but in
vain, so we were obliged to give him over; and if he
alone had suffered for it, the loss had been less. I could not satisfy myself, however, without ventu-
ring on shore once more, to try if I could learn any
thing of him or them; it was the third night after the
action that I had a great mind to learn, if I could by
any means, what mischief we had done, and how the
game stood'on the Indians' side. I was careful to do
it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again; but I
ought indeed to have been sure that the men I went
with had been under my command, before I engaged in
a thing so hazardous and mischievous as I was brought
into fcy it without design. We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the
ship, besides the supercargo and myself, and we landed
two hours before midnight, at the same place where the
Indians stood drawn up the evening before: I landed
here, because my design, as I have said, was chiefly to
see if they had quitted the field, and if they had left any
marks behind them of the mischief we had done them;
and I thought if we could surprise one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our man again, by way of ex-
change. We landed without any noise, and divided our men
into two bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded
one, and I the other. We neither saw or heard any-
i
body stir when we landed: and we marched up, one bo-
dy at a distance from the other, to the place; but at first
could see nothing, it being very dark.; till, by and by our boatswain, who led the first party, stumbled and
fell over a dead body. This made them halt a while; for
knowing by the circumstances that they were at the place
where the Indians had stood, they waited for my com-
ing up there. We concluded to halt till the moon be-
gan to rise, which we knew would be in less than an
hour, when we could easily discern the havoc we had
made among them. We told thirty-two bodies
upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead;
some had an arm, and some a leg shot off, and one his
head; those that were wounded, we suppose, they had
carried away. When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery
of all we could come to the knowledge of, I was resolv-
ed for going on board; but the boatswain and his party
sent me word that they were resolved tomake a visit to
the Indian town, where these dogs, as they called them,
dwelt, and asked me to go along with them; and if
they could find them, as they still fancied they should,
they did not doubt of getting a good booty; and it might
be, they might find Tom Jeffiry there; that was the
man's name we had lost. Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
enough what answer to have given them; for I should
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing it
was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a ship, and
ship-loading in our charge, and a voyage to make which
depended very much upon the lives of the men; but
as they sent me word they were resolved to go, and on-
ly asked me and my company to go along with them, I positively
positively refused it, and rose up, for I was sitting on
the ground, in order to go to the boat. One or two of
the men began to importune me to go; and when I re-
fused, began to grumble, and say that they were not
under my command, and they would go. Come, Jack,
says one of the men, will you go with me?—I'll go for
one. Jack said he would,—and then another,—and, in
a word, they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to
stay, and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo and
I, with the third man, went back to the boat, where we
told them we would stay for them, and take care to take
in as many of them as should be left; for I told them
it was a mad thing they were going about, and suppo-
sed most of them would run the fate of Tom Jeffry. They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come off again, and they would take care,
&c. so away they went. I entreated them to consider
the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their
own, and that they were entrusted with the voyage, in
some measure; that if they miscarried, the'ship might
be lost for want of their help, and that they could not
answer for it to God or man. But I might as well have
talked to the mainmast of the ship; they were mad up-
on their journey, only they gave me good words, and
begged I would not be angry; that they did not doubt
but they would be back again in about an hour at farthest;
for the Indian town, they said, was not above half a
mile off, though they found it above two miles before
they got to it. Well, they all went away as above; and though the
attempt was desperate, and such as none but madmen
would have gone about, yet, to give them their due,
they went about it as warily as boldly: they were
gallantly
gallantly armed, for they had every man a fuzee or mus-
ket, a bayonet, and a pistol; some of them had broad
cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boatswain
and two more had pole-axes; besides all which, they
had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes : bolder fel-
lows, and better provided, never went about any wicked
work in the world. When they went out, their chief design was plunder,
and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there;
but a circumstance, which none of them were aware of, set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them
all. When they came to the few Indian houses which
they thought had been the town, which was not above
half a mile off, they were under a great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses; and
where the town was, or how big, they knew not. They
consulted therefore what to do, and were some time
before they could resolve; for if they fell upon these,
they must cut all their throats, and it was ten to one
but some of them might escape, it being in the night,
though the moon was up; and if one escaped, he would
run away and raise all the town, so they should have
a whole army upon them: again, on the other hand, if
they went away and left those untouched, for the peo-
ple were all asleep, they could not tell which way to
look for the town.
However, the last was the best advice; so they resol-
ved to leave them, and look for the town as well as
they could : they went on a little way, and found a cow
tied to a tree; this, they presently concluded, would be a
good guide to them; for, they said, the cow certainly
belonged to the town before them, or the town behind
them; and if they untied her, they shouldsee which way
s
i'
way she went; if she went back, they had nothing to
say to her; but, if she went forward, they would follow
her: so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted
flags, and the cow went on before them, directly toth$ftv;
town; which, as they reported, consisted of above two hundred houses or huts, and in some of these they found several families living together. Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure--fs"
as sleep could make them: and first, they called another
council, to consider what they had to do; and, in a
word, they resolved to divide themselves into three bo-*
'dies, and so set three houses on fire in three parts of
the town; and as the men came out, to seize them and
bind them (if any resisted, they need not be asked what
to do then), and so to search the rest of the houses for
plunder: but they resolved to march silently first
through the town, and see what dimensions it was of,
and if they might venture upon it or no. They did so, and desperately resolved that they
would venture upon them: but while they were ani-
mating one another to the work, three of them, who
were a little before the rest, called out aloud to them,
and told them that they had found Tom Jeffry: they
all ran up to the place, where they found the poor fel-
low hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat cut.
There was an Indian house just by the tree, where they
found sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians,
who had been concerned in the fray with us before, and two or three of them wounded with our shot; and
our men/ound they were awake, and talking one to another in that house, but knew not their number. The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged
them, as before, that they swore to one another they

Would be revenged, and that not an Indian that came into their hands should have any quarter; and to work
they went immediately, and yet not so madly as, by ths
rage and fury they were in, might be expected: their
first care was to get something that would soon take fire,
but, after a little search, they found that would be to no
purpose; but the most of the houses were low, and
thatched with flags and rushes, of which the country
is full; so they presently made some wild-fire, as we
call it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of their
hands, and in a quarter of an hour they set the town
on fire in four or five places, and particularly that
house where the Indians were not gone to bed. As
soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened
creatures began to rush out to save their lives, but met
with their fate in the attempt; and especially at the door,
where they drove them back, the boatswain himself kill-
ing one or two with his pole-axe: the house being
large, and many in it, he did not care to go in, but
called for a hand-grenado, and threw it among them, which at first frightened them, but, when it burst, made
such havoc among them,, that they cried out in a hi-
deous manner. In short, most of the Indians who were in the open
part of the house were killed or hurt with the grenado,
except two or three more who pressed to the door,
which the boatswain and two more kept, with their
bayonets on the muzzles of their pieces, and dispatched
all that came in their way: but there was another apart-
ment in the house, where the prince or king, or what-
ever he was, and several others were; and these were
kept in till the house, which was by this time all in a light flame, fell in upon them, and they were smother-
ed together. Vol. II. P Aft
ADVENTURES OF »
All this while they fired not a gun, because they
would not waken the people faster than they could mas-
ter them; but the fire began to waken them fast enough,
and our fellows were glad to keep a little together in
bodies; for the fire grew so raging, all the houses be-
ing made of light combustible stuff, that they could
hardly bear the street between them; and their business
was to follow the fire, for the surer execution: as sast
as the fire either forced the people out of those houses
which were burning, or frightened them out of others,
our people were ready at their doors to knock them on
the head, still calling and hollowing one to another to re-
member Tom Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very un-
easy, and especially when I saw the flames of the town,
which, it being night, seemed to be just by me. My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men
too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing
what the'matter was, or what danger I was in, especi-
ally hearing the guns too, for by this time they began
to use their fire-arms; a thousand thoughts oppressed
his mind concerning me and the supercargo, what
would become of us; and, at last, though he could ill
spare any more men, yet not knowing what exigence
we might be in, he takes another boat, and with thir-
teen men and himself comes on shore to me. He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the
boat, with no more than two men; and though he was
glad that we were well, yet he was in the same impati-
ence with us to know what was doing; for the noise
continued, and the flame increased; in short, it was
next to an impossibility for any man in the world to re-
strain their curiosity to know what had happened, or
their
their concern for the safety of the men: in a word, the
captain told me he would go and help his men, let
what would come. I argued with him, as I did before
with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the
voyage, the interest of the owners and merchants, &c.
and told him I would goand the two men, and only see if we could at a distance learn what was like to be the
event, and come back and tell him. It was all one to talk
to my nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before; he
would go, he said; and he only wished he had left but
ten men in the ship; for he could not think of having
his men lost for want of help; he had'rather lose the
ship, the voyage, and his life and all; and away he
went. I was no more able to stay behind now than I was
to persuade them not to go; so, in short, the captain or-
dered two men to row back the pinnace, and fetch
twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an anchor;
and that when they came back, six men should keep the
two boats, and six more come after us: so that he left
only sixteen men in the ship; for the whole ship's com-
pany consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost
in the late quarrel which brought this mischief on. Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt
little of the ground we trod on; and being guided by
the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the place
of the flame. If the noise of the guns was surprising to
us before, the cries of the poor people were now quite
of another nature, and filled us with horror. I must
confess I was never at the sacking a city, or at the ta-
king a town by storm; 1 had heard of Oliver Crom-
well taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing mart*
woman and child; and I had read of Count Tilly sackP a ing
ing the city of Magdebourg, and cutting the throats of
twenty-two thousand of all sexes; but I never had an
idea of the thing itself before, nor is it possible to de-
scribe it, or the horror that was upon our minds at
hearing it. However, we went on, and at length came
to the town, though there was no entering the streets
of it for the fire. The first object we met with was
the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it,
for the house was consumed; and just before it, plain
now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men
and three women killed, and, as we thought, one or
two more lay in the heap among the fire: in short,
there were such instances of rage altogether barbarous,
and of a fury something beyond what was human, that
we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it;
or if they were the authors of it, we thought they
ought to be every one of them put to the worst of
deaths. But this was not all: we saw the fire increased
forward, and the cry went on just as the fire went on;
so that we were in the utmost confusion. We advan-
ced alittle way farther; and, behold, to ourastonistimenr,
three naked women, and crying in a most dreadful
manner, came flying as if they had wings, and after
them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same
terror and consternation, with three of our English but-
chers in the rear; who, when they could not overtake
them, fired in among them, and one that was killed
by their shot fell down in our sight. When the rest
saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and that we
would murder them as well as those that pursued them,
they set up a most dreadful shriek, especially the wo-
men, and two of them fell down, as if already dead,
with the fright. My
My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran
chill in my veins, when I saw this: and I believe, had
the three English sailors that pursued them come on, I
had made our men kill them all: however, we took
some ways to let the poor flying creatures know that
we would not hurt them; and immediately they came
up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands lifted up,
made piteous lamentation to us to save them, which
we let them know we would; whereupon they crept
altogether in a huddle close behind us, as for protection.
I left my men drawn up together, and charging them
to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of our
people, and see what devil it was possessed them, and
what they intended to do, and to command them off;
assuring them that if they stayed till daylight, they
would have a hundred thousand men about their ears:
I say, I left them, and went among those flying people,
taking only two of our men with me; and there was
indeed a piteous spectacle among them; some of them
had their feet terribly burned, with trampling and run-
ning through the fire, others their hands burned; one
of the women had fallen down in the fire, and was
very much burned before she could get out again; and
two or three of the men had cuts in their backs and
thighs, from our men pursuing; and another was shot
through the body, and died while I was there. I would'fain have learned what the occasion of all
this was, but I could not understand one word they said;
though, by signs, I perceived some of them knew not
what was the occasion themselves. I was so terrified in.
my thoughts at this outrageous attempt. that I could
not stay there, but went back to my own men, and re-
solved to go into the middle of the town, through the
'L P 3 fire,
fire, or whatever might be in the way, and put an end
to it, cost what it would: accordingly, as I came back
to my men, I told them my resolution, and commanded
them to follow me; when, in the very moment came
four of our men, with the boatswain at their head,
roving over heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered
with blood and dust, as if they wanted more people to massacre, when our men hollowed to them as loud as they
could hollow; and with much ado one of them made them
hear, so that they knew who we were, and came up
to us. As soon the boatswain saw us, he set up a holla, like a
shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more
help come; and without waiting to hear me, Captain,
says he, noble captain! I am glad you are come; we
are not half done yet: villainous, hell-hound dogs J I'H
kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his
head: we have sworn to spare none of them; we'll root
out the very nation of them from the earth: and thus
he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word. At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a
little, Barbarous dog' said I, what are you doing? I
won't have one creature touched more, upon pain of
death: I charge you, upon your life, to stop your hands,
and stand still here, or you are a dead man this minute.
Why,. Sir, says he, do you know what you do, or
what they have done? If you want a reason for what
we have done, cpme hither; and with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging wjth his throat cut.
1 confess I was urged then myself, and at another
time would have been forward enough; but I though
^hey had carried their rage too far, and remembered Jacob'*
Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi: " Cursed
be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it
was cruel." But I had now a new task upon my
hands; for when the men I carried with me saw the
sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain
them as I should have had with the others; nay, my
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their
hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of the men
being overpowered; and as to the people, he thought
not one of them ought to live; for they had all glutted
themselves with the murder of the poor man, and that
they ought to be used like murderers : upon these words,
away ran eight of my men, with the boatswain and his
crew, to complete their bloody work; and I, seeing it
quite out of my power to restrain them, came away
pensive and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much
less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches
that fell into their hands. I got nobody to come back with me but the super-
cargo and two men, and with these walked back to the
boat. It was a very great piece of folly in me, I con-
fess, to venture back as it were alone; for as it began
now to be almost day, and the alarm had run over the
country, there stood about forty men, armed with lances
and bows, at the little place where the twelve or thir-
teen houses stood, mentioned before; but by accident I
missed the place, and came directly to the sea-side; and
by the time I got to the sea.fide, it was broad day: im-
mediately I took the pinnace and went aboard, and sent
her back to assist the men in what might happen. I observed, about the time that I came to the boat
fide, that the fire was pretty well out, and the noise
V 4 abated; ADVENTURES OF
but in about half an hour after I got on board I heard a volley of our men's firearms, and saw a great smoke: this, as I understood afterwards, was our men falling upon the men who, as I said, stood at the few houses
on the way, of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen,
and set all the houses on fire, but did not meddle with
the women or children. By the time the men got to the shore again with the
pinnace, our men began to appear; they came dropping
in, not in two bodies as they went, but straggling here
and there in such a manner, that a small force of reso-
lute men might have cut them all off. But the dread of them was upon the whole country;
and the men were fui prized, and so frightened, that I
believe a hundred of them would have fled at the
sight of but five of our men: nor in all this terrible ac-
tion was there a man that made any considerable de-
fence; they were so surprised between the terror of the
fire and the sudden attack of our men in the dark, that
they knew not which way to turn themselves; for if
they fled one way they were met by one party; if back
again, by another; so that they were every where
knocked down: nor did any of our men receive the
least hurt, except one that sprained his foot, and ano-
ther that had one of his hands burned.
1 was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and
indeed with all the men, in my mind, but with him in
particular, as well for his acting so out of his duty, as
commander of the ship, and having the charge of the
voyage upon him, as in his prompting, rather than
cooling, the rage of his blind men, in so bloody and
cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me very re-
spectfully, but told me, that, when he saw the body of the
the poor seaman whom they had murdered in so cruel
and barbarous a manner, he was not master of himself,
neither could he govern his passion; he owned he
should not have done so, as he was commander of the
ship; but as he was a man, and nature moved him, he
could not bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were
not subject to me at all, and they knew it well enough;
so they took no notice of my dislike. The next day we set sail, so we never heard any more
of it. Our men differed in the account of the number they had killed; but according to the best of their ac-
counts, put all together, they killed or destroyed about
one hundred and fifty people, men, women, and chil-
dren, and left not a house standing in the town. As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite
dead,for his throat was so cut that his head was half
off, it would do him no service to bring him away; so
they only took him down from the tree, where he was
hanging by one hand. However just our men thought this action, I was
against them in it, and I always, after that time, told
them God would blast the voyage; for I looked upon
all the blood they shed that night to be murder in them:
for though it is true that they had killed Tom Jeffry, yet Jeffry was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and
had violated or debauched a young woman of theirs, who came down to them innocently, and on the faith of the public capitulation. The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said it was true that we seem-
ed to break the truce, but really had not; and that the
war was begun the night before by the natives them-
selves, who had shot at us, and killed one of our men without
without any just provocation; so that as we were in a capacity to fight them now, we might also be in a ca-
pacity to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraor-
dinary manner; that though the poor man had taken a
little liberty with the wench, he ought not to have been
murdered, and that in such a villanous manner; and
that they did nothing but what was just, and what the
laws of God allowed to be done to murderers. One would think this should have been enough to
have warned us against going on shore amongst hea-
thens and barbarians: but it is impossible to make man-
kind wise but at their own expense; and their expe-
rience seems to be always of most use to them when it
is dearest bought. We were now bound to the gulph of Persia, and
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch
at Surat: but the chief of the supercargo's design lay at
the bay of Bengal; where if he missed his business
outward-bound, he was to go up to China, and return
to the coast as he came home. The first disaster that befel us was in the gulph of
Persia, where five of our men venturing on shore on
the Arabian side of the gulf, were surrounded by the
Arabians, and either all killed or carried away into slave-
ry; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them,
and had but just time to get off their boat. I began to
upbraid them with the just retribution of Heaven in this
case: but the boatswain very warmly told me, he thought
I went farther in my censures than I could show any
warrant for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii» 4,
where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom
the tower of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the
Gallileans: but that which, indeed put me to silence in the
the case, was, that not one of these five men who were
now lost were of those who went on shore to the massa*
ere of Madagascar, so I always called it, though our
men could not bear to hear the word massacre with
any patience. But my frequent preaching to them on the subject
had worse consequences than I expected; and the boat-
swain, who had been the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me he found that I
brought that affair continually upon the stage; that I
made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the men
very ill on that account, and himself in particular;
that as I was but a passenger, and had no command in
the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not oblig-
ed to bear it; that they did not know but I might have
some ill design in my head, and perhaps to call them to
an account for it when they came to England; and that, therefore, unless I would resolve to have done with it,
and also not to concern myself any farther with him,
or any of his affairs, he would leave the ship; for he
did not think it was safe to sail with me among them. I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him, that I confessed I had all along opposed
the massacre of Madagascar, and that I had, on all oc-
casions, spoken my mind freely about it, though not
more upon him than any of the rest; that as to having no command in the ship, that was true; nor did
I exercise any authority, only took the liberty of speak-
ing my mind in things which publicly concerned us all;
and what concern I had in the voyage was none of his
business; that I was a considerable owner in the ship; in
that claim, I conceived I had a right to speak even farther than I had done, and would not be accountable to him
him or any one else; and began to be a little warm with
him: he made but little reply to me at that time, and
I thought the affair had been over. We were at this
time in the road at Bengal; and being willing to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo, in the
ship's boat, to divert myself; and towards evening was
preparing to go on board, when one of the men came to
me, and told me he would not have me trouble myself
to come down to the boat, for they had orders not to
carry me on board any more. Any one may guess what
a surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked
the man who bade him deliver that message to me? He
told me, the cockswain. I said no more to the fellow,
but bade him let them know he had delivered his message,
and that I had given him no answer to it.
- :I immediately went and found out the supercargo,
and told him the story; adding, what Ipresently fore-
saw, viz. That there would be a mutiny in the ship;
and entreated him to go immediately on board the ship
in an Indian boat, and acquaint the captain of it.
But I might have spared this intelligence, for before I
had spoken to him on shore the matter was effected on
board. The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and
all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone off in the
boat, came up, and desired to speak with the captain;
and there the boatswain, making a long harangue, and
repeating all he had said'to me, told the captain, in a few
words, that'as I was now gone peaceably on shore, they
were loath to use any violence with me, which, if I had
not gone on shore they'would otherways have done, to
oblige me to have gone; they therefore thought fit to
tell him. that'as they shipped themselves to serve in the
ship under his command, they would perform it well
i and5
and faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or
the captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the
ship, and sail no farther with him; and at that word all, he turned his face toward the mainmast, which
was, it seems, the signal agreed on between them, at
which all the seamen, being got together, there cried
out, One and All! One and all!My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and
of great presence of mind ; and though he was surprised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told them calm-
ly that he would consider of the matter; but that he
could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about
it. He used some arguments with them to show them
the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing: but it
was all in vain; they swore, and shook hands round be-
fore his face, that they would all go on shore, unless he
would engage to them not to suffer me to come any
more on board the ship. This was a hard article upon him, who knew his
obligation to me, and did not know how I might take
it: so he began to talk smartly to them; told them that
I was a very considerable owner of the ship, and that,
in justice, he could not put me out of my own house;
that this was next door to serving me as the famous pi-
rate Kidd had done, who made a mutiny in the ship,
set the captain on shore on an uninhabited island, and
ran away with the ship; that let them go into what ship they would, if ever they came to England again it
would cost them very dear; that the ship was mine,
and that he could not put me out of it; and that he
would rather lose the ship and the voyage too than
disoblige me so much; so they might do as theypleascd:
however, he would go on shore and talk with me, and invited
invited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they
might accommodate the matter with me. But they all rejected the proposal, and said they
would have nothing to do with me any more; and if I
came on board, they would all go on shore. Well,
said the captain, if you are all of this mind, let me go
on shore and talk with him: So away he came to me
with this account, a little after the message had been
brought to me from the cockswain. I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess;
for I was not without apprehensions that they would
confine him by violence, set sail, and run away with
the ship; and then I had been stripped naked in a re-
mote country, having nothing to help myself; in short,
I had been in a worse case than when I was alone in
the island. But they had not come that length, it seems, to my
satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what they
had said to him, and how they had sworn and shook
hands that they would, one and all, leave the ship if I
was suffered to come on board, I told him he should
not be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore:
I only desired he would take care and send me all my
necessary things on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum
of money, and I would find my way to England as well
as I could. This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but
there was no way to help it but to comply: so, in short,
he went on board the ship again, and satisfied the men
that his uncle had yielded to their importunity, and had
sent for his goods from on board the ship; so that mat-
ter was over in a few hours, the men returned to their
duty, and I began to consider what course I should
steer.
I was
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world,
as I think I may call it, for I was near three thousand
leagues by sea farther off from England than I was at my
island; only, it is true, I might travel here by land over the great Mogul's country to Surat, might go from
thence to Bassora by sea, up the gulph of Persia, and
take the way of the caravans, over the Desert of Arabia,
to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by sea again
to Italy,and so over-land into France; and this put to-
gether might at least be a full diameter of the globe, or
more. I had another way before me, which was to wait for
some English ships, which were coming to Bengal from
Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get passage on
board them for England. But as 1 came hither with-
out any concern with the English East-India Conpany,
so it would be difficult to go from hence without their
licence,unless with great favour of the captains of the
ships, or the Company'6 sactors, and to both I was an
utter stranger. Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without me; a treatment I think a man in my circum-
stances scarce ever met with, except when pirates run-
ning away with the ship, and setting those that would
not agree with their villainy on shore. Indeed, this
was next door to it, both ways; however, my nephew
left me two servants, or rather one companion and
one servant; the first was clerk to the purser, whom he
engaged to go with me, and the other was his own ser-
vant. I took me also a good lodging in the house of an
Englishwoman, where several merchants lodged, some
French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one English-
man; here I was handsomely enough entertained: and
* that
that I might not be said to run rashly upon any thing;
1 stayed here above nine months considering what
course to take, and how to manage myself. I had some
English goods with me of value, and a considerable sum
of money, my nephew furnishing me with a thousand
pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I had occasion, that I might not be straitened, whatever
might happen. I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage, and,
as I originally intended, I bought here some very good
diamonds, which, of all other things, were the most
proper for me, in my present circumstances; because
I could always carry my whole estate about me. After a long stay here, and many proposals made for
my return to England, but none falling out to my mind,
the English merchant who lodged with me, and whom
I had contracted an intimate acquaintance with, came
to me one morning. Countryman, says he, I have a
project to communicate to you, which, as it suits with
my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it.
Here we are posted, says he,you by accident, and I by
my own choice, in a part of the world very remote
from our own country; but it is in a country where,
by us who understand trade and business, a great deal of
money is to be got. If you will put ioool. to my ioool.
we will hire a ship here, the first we can get to our
minds; you shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and
we'll go a trading voyage to China: for what should we
stand still for? The whole world is in motion, rolling
round and round; all the creatures of God, heavenly
bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent; why should
we be idle? There are no drones in the world but men; why should we be of that number?
I liked
t liked this proposal very well, and the more because
* k seemed to be expressed with so much good-will, and
in so friendly a manner. I will not say but that I
might, by my loose unhinged circumstances, be the
fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, or indeed any
thing else; whereas, otherwise, trade was none of my
element. However, I might perhaps say with some
truth, that if trade was not my element, rambling was,
and no proposal for seeing any part of the world which
I had never seen before could possibly come amiss to
me. It was, however, sometime before we could get a ship to our minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was
not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so many
as were necessary to govern the voyage and manage the
sailors which we should pick up there. After some
time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, English;
a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast-men. With
these we found we could do well enough, having Indian
seamen, such as they were, to make up. There are so many travellers who have wrote the his-
tory of their voyages and travels this way, that it would
be very little diversion to any body to give a long ac-
count of the places we went to, and the people who in-
habit there; these things I leave to others, and refer the
reader to those journals and travels of Englishmen, of
which many, I find, are published and more promised
every day; 'tis enough for me to tell you that we made
this voyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and
from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our
wares for opium and some arrack; the first a commo-
dity which bears a great price among the Chinese, and
which, at that time, was much wanted there. In a Vol. II. Q. word,
word, we went up to Suskan, made a very great voyage,
were eight months out, and returned to Bengal; and I
was very well satisfied with my adventure. I observe that our people in England often admire how offi-
cers which the Company send into India, and the mer-
chants which generally stay there, get such very great
estatesas they do, and sometimes come home worth
sixty or seventy thousand pounds at a time; but it is no
wonder, or at least we shall see so much farther into it,
when we consider the innumerable ports and places
where they have a free commerce, that it will be none;
and much less it will be so when we consider that at
those places and ports where the English ships come,
there is such great and constant demand for the growth
of all other countries, that there is a certain vent for
the returns, as well as a market abroad for the goods
carried out. In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so
much money by my first adventure, and such an insight
into the method of getting more, that had I been twen-
ty years younger, I should have been tempted to have
stayed here, and sought no farther for making any for-
tune; but what was all this to a man upwards of three-
score, that was rich enough, and came abroad more in
obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a
covetous desire of getting in it? And, indeed, I think'tis
with great justice I now call it restless desire, for it was
so. When I was at home, I was restless to go abroad;
and when I was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I
say, what was this gain to me? I was rich enough already,
nor had I any uneasy desires about getting more money;
and therefore the profit of the voyage to me was of no
great force for the prompting me forward to farther under-
»
undertakings; hence I thought that by this voyage I had
made no progress at all, because I was come back, as I
might call it, to the place from whence I came, as to a
home: whereas my eye, which, like that which Solo-
mon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing, was still
more desirous of wandering and seeing. I was come
into a part of the world which I was never in before,
and that part, in particular, which I had heard much
of, and was resolved to see as much of it as I could; and
then I thought I might say I had seen all the world that
was worth seeing. But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions:
I do not name this to insist on my own, for I acknow-
ledge his were the most just, and the most suited to the
end of a merchant's life; who, when he is abroad upon
adventures, it is his wisdom to stick to that, as the best
thing for him, which he is like to get the most money
by. My new friend kept himself to the nature of the
thing, and would have been content to have gone like
a carrier's horse, always to the same inn, backward and
forward, provided he could, as he called it, find his ac-
count in it. On the other hand, mine was the notion
of a mad rambling boy, that never cares to see a thing
twice over. But this was not all: I had a kind of im-
patience upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most
unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go.
In the interval of these consultations, my friend, who
was always upon the search for business, propose c'ano-ther voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring
home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or there-
abouts; places where, indeed, the Dutch trade, but
islands belonging partly to the Spaniards; though we
Q_z went
went not so far, but to some other, where they have not
the whole power, as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the
chief difficulty was in bringing me to come into it:
however, at last, nothing else offering, and sinding that
really stirring about and trading, the profit being so
great, and, as I may say, certain, had more pleasure in
it, and had more satisfaction to my mind, than sitting
still, which, to me especially, was the unhappiest part
of life; I resolved on this voyage too, which we made
very successfully, touching at Borneo, and several islands
whose names I do not remember, and came home in
about five months. We sold our spice, which was
chiefly cloves and some nutmegs, to the Persian mer-
chants, who carried them away to the Gulph; and
making near five of one, we really got a great deal of
money. My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at
me: Well now, said he, with a sort of agreeable insult
upon my indolent temper, is not this better than walk-
ing about here, like a man of nothing to do, and spend-
ing our time in staring at the nonsense and ignorance
of the Pagans? Why truly, says I, my friend, I think
it is, and I begin to be a convert to the principles of
merchandising; but I must tell you, said 1, by the way,
you do not know what I am doing; for if I once con-
quer my backwardness, and embark heartily, as old as
I am, 1 shall harrass you, up and down the world, 'till I
tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never
let you lie still.
But, to be short with my speculations, a little while
after this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia;
she was a coaster, not an European trader, of about two hundred
hundred tons burthen; the men, as they pretended,
having been so sickly, that the captain had not hands
enough to go to sea with, he lay by at Bengal; and hav-
ing, it seems, got money enough, or being willing, for
other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice
he would sell his ship. This came to my ears before my
new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy
it; so I went to him, and told him of it. He considered
awhile, for he was no rash man neither; but musing
some time, he replied, She is a little too big; but, how-
ever, we will have her: accordingly we bought the ship,
and agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and took
possession. When we had done so, we resolved to enter-
tain the men, if we could, to join them with those we had,
for the pursuing our business; but on a sudden, they
having received, not their wages, but their share of the
money, as we afterwards learnt, not one of them was
to be found; we enquired much about them, and at
length were told that they were all gone together by
land to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence,
and from thence to travel to Surat, and go by sea to the
Gulph of Persia. Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I missed the opportunity of going with them;
for such a ramble, I thought, and in such company as
would both have guarded and diverted me, would have
suited mightily with my great design; and I should both
have seen the world and gone homewards too: but I
was much better satisfied a few days after, when I came
to know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short,
their history was, that this man they called captain was the gunner only, not the commander; that they
had been a trading voyage, in which they were attacked
on shore by some of the Malays, who had killed the Q_ 3 captain
captain and three of his men; and that after the captain
was killed, these men, eleven in number, had resolved
to runaway with the ship, which they did, and brought
her to Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more on
shore; of whom hereafter. Well, let them get the ship how they would, we
came honestly by her, as we thought, though we did
not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as we
ought; for we never inquired any thing of the seamen,
who would certainly have faltered in their account,
contradicted one another, and perhaps contradicted
themselves ;' or, one how or other we should have had
reason to have suspected them; but the man showed us
a bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name, for I suppose it was all a for-
gery, and called himself by that name, and we could
not contradict him; and withal having no suspicion
of the thing, we went through with our bargain. We picked up some more English sailors here after
this, and some Dutch; and now we resolved for a se-
cond voyage to the south-east for cloves, &c. that is to
say, among the Philippine and Molucca isles; and in
short, not to fill up this part of my story with trifles,
when what is to come is so remarkable, I spent, from
first to last, six years in this country, trading from port
to port, backward and forward, and with very good
success, and was now the last year with my new part-
ner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage
to China, but designing first to Siam, to buy rice. In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to
beat up and down a great while in the straits of Ma-
lacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner got
clear of those difficult seas, but we found our ship had sprung
sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all our indus-
try, to find out where it was. This forced us to make
some port, and my partner, who knew the country better
than I did, directed the captain to put into the river of
Cambodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr.
Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge
of the ship upon myself. This river lies on the north
side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam. While we were here, and going often on shore for
refreshment, there comes to me one day an Englishman,
and he was, it seems, a gunner's-mateon board an Eng-
lish East India ship which rode in the same river, up at or near the city of Cambodia: what brought him hither
we knew not; but he comes to me, and speaking Eng-
lish, Sir, says he, you are a stranger to me, and I to
you, but I have something to tell you that very nearly
concerns you.
Hooked stedsaftly at him a good while, andthought
at first I had known him, but I did not: If it very nearly
concerns me, said I, and not yourself, what moves you
to tell it me? Iam moved, says he, by the imminent
danger you are in, and, for aught I see, you have
no knowledge of it. I know no danger I am in, says
I, but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out;
but I intend to lay her a-ground to-morrow, to see if
I can find it. But, Sir, says he, leaky or not leaky,
find it or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay your
ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear what I have
to say to you: do you know, Sir, said he, the town of
Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river? And
there are two large English ships about five leagues on
this side, and three Dutch. Well, said 1, and what is
that to me? Why, Sir, said he, is it for a man that is Q.4 upon.
upon such adventures as you are, to come into a port
and not examine first what ships there are there, and
whether he is able to deal with them? I suppose you
do not think you are a match for them? I was amused
very much at his discourse, but not amazed at it, for
I could not conceive what he meant; and I turned short
upon him, and said, Sir, I wish you would explain
yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I have to be
afraid of any of the Company's ships, or Dutch ships:
I am no interloper, what can they have to say to me?
He looked like a man half angry, and half pleased,
and pausing awhile, but smiling, Well, Sir, says he,
if you think yourself secure, you must take your chance;
1. am sorry your sate should blind you against good ad-
vice; but assure yourself, if you do not put to sea im*
mediately, you will, the very next tide, be attacked by
five long-boats full of men, and perhaps, if you are ta-
ken, you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars
be examined afterwards: 1 thought, Sir, added he, I
should have met with a better reception than this, for
doing you a piece of service of such importance. I can
never be ungrateful, said I, for any service, or to any
man that offers me any kindness; but it is past my comr
prehension, said I, what they should have such a design
upon me for: however, since you say there is no time
to be lost, and that there is some villainous design in hand
against me, I will go on board this minute, and put to
sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we
can swim without stopping it: but, Sir, said 1, shall
I go away ignorant of the cause of all this? Can you
give me no further light into it?
I can tell you but part of the story, Sir, says he, but
I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I believe I
could
233
'could persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is
scarce time for it: but the short of the story is this, the
first part of which, I suppose, you know well enough,
viz. that you was with this ship at Sumatra; that there
your captain was murdered by the Malays, with three
of his men; and that you, or some of those that were
on board with you, ran away with the ship, and are
since turned pirates. This is the sum of the story, and
you will all be seized as pirates, I can assure you, and
executed with very little ceremony; for you know merchant ships show but little law to pirates, if they get
them into their power.
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank
you; and though I know nothing that we have done like what you talk of, for I am sure we came honestly
and fairly by the ship; yet seeing such work is doing,
as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I will
be upon my guard. Nay, Sir, says he, do not talk of
being upon your guard; the best defence is, to be out of
the danger; if you have any regard for your life, and
the lives of all your men, put to sea, without fail, at high
water; and as you have a whole tide before you, you
will be gone too far out before they can come down;
for they will come away at high water, and as they have
twenty miles to come, you will get near two hours of
them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the
length of the way; besides, as they are only boats, and
not ships, they will not venture to follow you far out
to sea, especially if it blows.
Well, said I, you have been very kind in this; what
shall I do for you to make you amends? Sir, fays he,
you may not be willing to make me any amends, be-
cause you may not be convinced of the truth of it: I will
ADVENTURES OF
will make an offer to you; I have nineteen months pav
due to me on board the ship, , which I came out of England in; and the Dutchman that is with me has seven months pay due to him; if you will make
good our pay to us, we will go along with you: if you
find nothing more in it, we will desire no more; but if
we do convince you that we have saved your lives, and
the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will
leave the rest to you.
I consented to this readily, and went immediately on
board, and the two men with me. As soon as I came to
the ship's side, my partner, who was on board, came
out on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great
deal of joy, O ho! O ho! we have stopped the leak!
we have stopped the leak! Say you so, said I, thank
God; but weigh anchor then immediately. Weigh!
says he, What do you mean by that? What is the mat-
ter? says he. Aft no questions, said I; but all hands
to work, and weigh without losing a minute. He was
surprized, but however, he called the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and
though the tide was not quite done, yet a little land
breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I called him
into the cabin, and told him the story; and we called
in the men, and they told us the rest of it: but as it
took up a great deal of time, before we had done a sea-
man comes to the cabin-door, and called out to us that the captain bade him tell us we were chased: Chas-
ed, says I; by what? By five sloops, or boats, says the
fellow, full of men. Very well, said I; then it is ap-
parent there is something in it. In the next place I or-
dered all our men to be called up, and told them there
was a design to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates, and
235
asked them if they would stand by us, and by one ano-
ther; the men answered cheerfully, one and all, that
they would live and die with us. Then I asked the cap-
tain what way he thought best for us to manage a fight with them; for resist them I was resolved we would,
and that to the last drop. He said readily that the way
was to keep them off with our great shot as long as we
could, and then to fire at them with our small arms,
to keep them from boarding us; but when neither of
these would do any longer, we should retire to our close
quarters; perhaps they had not materials to break open
our bulk-heads, or get in upon us. The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring
two guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to
clear the deck, and load them with musket-bullets and
small pieces of old iron, and what came next to hand;
and thus we made ready for sight: but all this while we
kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could see the
boats at a distance, being five large long-boats, follow-
ing us with all the sail they could make. Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could
see were English) out-sailed the rest, were near two
leagues a-head of them, and gained upon us considera-
bly, so that we found they would come up with us; up-
on which we fired a gun without ball, to intimate that
they should bring to: and we put out a flag of truce,
as a signal for parley; but they came crowding after us, till they came within shot, when we took in our white
flag, they having made no answer to it, hung out a red
flag, and fired at them with a shot. Notwithstanding
this, they came on till they were near enough to call to
them with a speaking-trumpet which we had on board;
so we called to them, and bade them keep off, at their
peril. It
It was all one; theycrouded after us, and endeavour-
ed to come under our stern, so to board us on our quar-
ter; upon which, seeing they were resolute for mis-
chief, and depended upon the strength that followed
them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that they lay
upon our broadside; when immediately we fired five
guns at them, one of which had been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of the hindermost boat, and
bring them to the necessity of taking down their sail,
and running all to the head of the boat to keep her from
sinking; so she lay by, and had enough of it; but see-
ing the foremost boat crowd on after us, we made rea-
dy to fire at her in particular. While this was doing, one of the three boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made
up to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve her,
and we could see her take out the men: we called again
to the foremost boat, and offered a truce, to parley again,
and to know what her business was with us; but had no
answer, only she crowded close under our stern: upon
this our gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, run
out his two chase-guns, and fired again at her, but the
shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their
caps, and came on; but the gunner, getting quickly rea-
dy again, fired among them a second time, one shot of
which, though it missed the boat itself, yet fell in among
the men, and we could easily see had done a great deal
of mischief among them; but we took no notice of
that, wore the ship again, and brought our quarter to
bear upon them, and firing three guns more, we found
the boat was almost split to pieces; in particular, her
rudder and a piece of her stern was shot quite away; so
they handed her sail immediately, and were in great disorder:
disorder: but to complete their misfortune, our gun-
ner let fly two guns at them again; where he hit them we
could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking, and
some of the men already in the water: upon this I im-
mediately manned out our pinnace, which we had kept
close by our side, with orders to pick up some of the
men, if they could, and save them from drowning, and
immediately come on board the ship with them, because
we saw the rest of the boats began to come up. Our
men in the pinnace followed their orders, and took up
three men, one of whom was just drowning, and it
was a good while before we could recover him. As
soon as they were on board, we crowded all the sail we
could make, and stood farther out to sea; and we found
that when the other three boats came up to the first,
they gave over their chafe.
Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than I apprehended, I resolved that we should
change our course, and not let any one know whither
we were going: so we stood out to sea eastward, quite out
of the course of all European ships, whether they were
bound to China or any where else, within the com-
merce of the European nations. When we were at sea, we began to consult with the
two seamen, and enquire first, what the meaning of all
this should be; and the Dutchman let us into the secret
at once, telling us that the fellow that sold us the ship,
as we said, was no more than a thief, that had run
away with her. Then he told us how the captain, whose
name too he told us, though I do not remember it now,
was treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast
of Malacca, with three of his men; and that he, this Dutchman,
Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where
they wandered about a great while, till at length he ia
particular, in a miraculous manner, made his escape,
and swam off to a Dutch ship, which, sailing near the
shore in its way from China, had sent their boat on
shore for fresh water; that he durst not come to that
part of the shore where the boat was, but made shift in
the night to take the water farther off, and swimming
a great while, at last the ship's boat took him up. He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two
of the seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having de-
serted the rest in their travels, and gave an account that
the fellow who had run away with the ship sold her at
Bengal to a set of pirates, which were gone a cruizing in
her; and that they had already taken an English ship
and two Dutch ships very richly laden. This latter part was found to concern us directly,
though we knew it to be false; yet, as my partner said
very justly, if we had fallen into their hands, and they
had had such a prepossession against us beforehand, it
had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves, or
to hope for any good quarter at their hands; and especi-
ally considering that our accusers had been our judges,
and that we could have expected nothing from them but
what rage would have dictated, and an ungoverned
passion have executed; and therefore it was his opinion
we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we
came, without putting in at any port whatever; because
there we could give a good account of ourselves, could
prove where we were when the ship put in, of whom
we bought her, and the like; and, which was more
than all the rest, if we were put upon the necessity of
bringing it before the proper judges, we should be sure to
to have some justice, and not to be hanged first and
judged afterwards. I was some time of my partner's opinion; but after
a little more serious thinking, I told him I thought it
was a very great hazard for us to attempt returning to
Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side of the Straits of Malacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should
be sure to be way-laid on every side, as well by the
Dutch of Batavia as the English elsewhere; that if we
should be taken, as it were, running away, we should
even condemn ourselves, and there would want no
more evidence to destroy us. I also asked the English
sailor's opinion, who said he was of my mind, and
that we should certainly be taken. This danger a little
startled my partner, and all the ship's company, and we
immediately resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin,
and so on to the coast of China; and, pursuing the first
design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of
the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the
country, such as we could get. This was approved of
as the best method for our security; and accordingly we
steered away N. N. E. keeping above fifty leagues off
from the usual course to the eastward. This, however,
put us to some inconvenience; for first the winds,
when we came to that distance from the shore, seemed to
be more steadily against us, blowing almost trade, as we
call it, from the E. and E. N. E. so that we were a
long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill pro-
vided with victuals for so long a run; and, which
was still worse, there was some danger that those Eng-
lish and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us, where-
of some were bound that way, might be got in before
us, and if not, some other ship bound to China might
5 have
have information of us from them, and pursue us with the same vigour. I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the long-boats, to have been in the most dangerous condition that ever
I was in through all my past life; for whatever ill cir-
cumstances I had been in, I was never pursued for a
thief before; nor had I ever done any thing that me-
rited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much less
thievish; I had chiefly been my own enemy, or, as I
may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my
own: but now I was embarrassed in the worst con-
dition imaginable; for though I was perfectly innocent,
I was in no condition to make that innocence appear;
and if I had been taken, it had been under a supposed
guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to make an escape,
though which way to do it I knew not, or what port or
place we could go to. My partner seeing me thus deject-
ed, though he was the most concerned at first, began
to encourage me, and describing to me the several ports
of that coast, told me he would put in on the coast of
Cochin China, or the bay of Tonquin, intending to go
afterwards to Macao, a town once in possession of the
Portuguese, and where still a great many European sa-
milies resided, and particularly the missionary priests
usually went thither, in order to their going forward to
China. Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly,
though after a tedious and irregular course, and very
much straitened for provisions, we came within sight of
the coast very early in the morning; and upon reflection
upon the past circumstances we were in, and the dan-
ger
241
ger i f we had not escaped, we resolved to put into a
small river, which, however, had depth enough of
water for us, and to see if we could, either over land, or
by the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were
in any port thereabouts. This happy step was indeed
our deliverance; for though we did not immediately see any European ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet the
next morningthere came into the bay two Dutch ships; and a third, without any colours spread out, but which
we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two
leagues distance, steering for the coast of China; and
in the afternoon went by two English ships steering the
same course; and thus we thought we saw ourselves
beset with enemies both one way and the other. The
place we were in was wild and barbarous; the people
thieves, even by occupation or profession; and, though
it is true, we had not much to seek of them, and, ex-
cept getting a few provisions, cared not how little we
had to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty
that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them, several ways. We were in a small river of this country,
within a few leagues of its utmost limits northward;
and by our boat we coasted north-east, to the point of
land which opens the great bay of Tonquin; and it
was in this beating up along the shore that we discover-
ed as above, thatwe were surrounded with enemies.
The people we were among were the most barbarous
of all the inhabitants of the coast, having no correspon-
dence with any other nation, and dealing only in fish
and oil, and such gross commodities; and it may be
particularly seen that they are the most barbarous of
any of the inhabitants. Among other customs, they
have this one, viz. that if any vessel has the misfortune
Vol II. & tQ
to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they presently
make the men all prisoners or slaves; and it was not
long before we found a piece of their kindness this
way, on the occasion following. I have observed above, that our ship sprung a leak at
sea, and that we could not find it out: and however,
it happened that, as I have said, it was stopped unex-
pectedly in the happy minute of our being to be seized
by the Dutch and English ships in the bay of Siam; yet,
as we did not find the ship so perfectly tight and sound
as we desired, we resolved, while we were at this place,
to lay her on shore, and take out what heavy things we
had on board, and clean her bottom; and, if possible,
to find out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought
all our guns and other moveables to one side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her bot-
tom; but,on second thoughts, we did not care to lay
her on dry ground, neither could we find out a proper
place for it. The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with
such a sight, came wondering down the shore to look at
us; and seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a
manner, and heeling in towards the shore, and not see-
ing our men, who were at work on her bottom with
stages, and with their boats on the off side, they pre-
sently concluded that the ship was cast away, and lay
so fast on the ground. On this supposition, they all came about us in two or
three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats, hav-
ing some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, in-
tending, no doubt, to have come on board and plun-
dered the ship; and if they had found us there, to have carried
carried us away for slaves to their king, or whatever
they call him, for we knew nothing of their governor. When they came up to the ship and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at work on the
outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing, and
graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man knows
how. They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprised, could not imagine what their
design was; but being willing to be sure, we took this
opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and others
to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were
at work to defend themselves with, if there should be
occasion; and it was no more than need; for in less
than a quarter of an hour's consultation, they agreed,
it seems, that the ship was really a wreck; and that we
were all at work endeavouring to save her, or to save
our lives by the help of our boats; and when we hand-
ed our arms into the boats, they concluded, by that
motion, that we were endeavouring to save some of
our goods; upon this they took it for granted we all
belonged to them, and away they came directly upon
our men, as if it had been in a line of battle. Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be fright-
ened, for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what they should do. I immediately
called to the men that worked upon the stages, to slip
them down, and get up the side into the ship; and bade
those in the boat to row round, and come on board;
and those few of us who were on board worked with
all the strength and hands we had to bring the ship to
rights; but, however, neither the men upon the stages,
noT those in the boats could do as they were ordered, R % before
before the Cochin-Chinese were upon them; and two
of their boats boarded our long-boat, and began to lay
hold on the men as their prisoners. The first man they laid hold on was an English sea-
man, a stout, strong fellow, who having a musket in
his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it down in
the boat, like a fool, as I thought; but he understood
his business better than I could teach him, for he grap-
pled the pagan, and dragged him by main force out of
their boat into ours, where taking him by the ears, he
beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, that the fel-
low died in his hands; and, in the mean time, a Dutch-
man, who stood next, took up the musket, and with
the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he knocked
down five of.them who attempted to enter the boat.
But this was doing little towards resisting thirty or forty
men, who fearless, because ignorant of their danger,
began to throw themselves into the long-boat, where
we had but five men in all to defend it: but the follow-
ing accident, which deserved our laughter, gave our
men a complete victory. Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside
of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had
calked her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let
down into the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and
the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and such stuff
as the shipwrights use for that work; and the man that
attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand,
with which he supplied the men that were at work with
the hot stuff; two of the enemy's men entered the boat
just where this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets;
he immediately saluted them with a ladle full of the
stuff, boiling hot, which so burned and scalded them, being
being half-naked, that they roared out like bulls, and, enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. The
carpenter saw it, and cried out, Well done, Jack! give
them some more of it; and stepping forward himself,
takes one of the mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot,
he and his man threw it among them so plentifully,
that, in short, of all the men in the three boats there
was not one that escaped being scalded and burned with
it, in a most frightful, pitiful manner, and made such
a howling and crying, that I never heard a worse
noise: for it is worth observing, that though pain na-
turally makes all people cry out, yet every nation has
a particular way of exclamation, and makes noises as
different from one another as their speech. I cannot
give the noise these creatures made a better name than
howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of it;
for I never heard any thing more like the noise of
the wolves, which, as I have said, I heard howl in
the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc. I was never better pleased with a victory in my life;
not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that
our danger was imminent before, but, as we got this
victory without any bloodshed, except of that man
the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I
was very much concerned at, for I was sick of killing
such poor savage wretches, even though it was in
my own defence, knowing they came on errands
which they thought just, and knew no better; and
that though it may be a just thing, because necessary (for there is no necessary wickedness in nature), yet I
thought it was a sad life, when we must be always
obliged to be killing our fellow creatures^ to preserve
Ourselves; andindeed, I think so still, and I would R 3 even
even now suffer a great deal, rather than I would take
away the life even of the worst person injuring me; and I believe all considering people who know the value of
life would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously
into the consideration of it. But to return to my story, all the while this was
doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of the
men on board, had with great dexterity brought the
ship almost to rights, and having got the guns into
their places again, the gunner called to me to bid our
boat get out of the way, for he would let fly among
them. I called back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work withr
out him, but bid him heat another pitch-kettle, which
our cook, who was on board, took care of: but the
enemy was so terrified with what they had met with in their first attack, that they would not come on again;
and some of them who were farthest off, seeing the
ship swim, as it were, upright, began, as we suppose,
to see their mistake, and give over the enterprize, finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear
of this merry fight, and having got some rice, and
some roots and bread, with about sixteen hogs, on board, two days before, we resolved to stay here no longer,
but go forward, whatever came of it; for we made
no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us. We therefore got all our things on board the same
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail: in the
mean time, lying at anchor at some distance from the
shore, we were not so much concerned, being now in a
fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any
enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our work
work within board, and finding our ship was perfectly
healed of all her leaks, we set sail. We would have
gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to in-
form ourselves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because we had seen several ships go in,
as we supposed, but a little before; so we kept on N. E.
towards the island of Formosa, as much afraid of being
seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship, as a Dutch or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of
an Algerine man of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E. as
if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine islands,
and this we did that we might not fall into the way of
any of the European ships; and then we steered north,
till we came to the latitude of 22 deg. 30 min. by which
means we made the island Formosa directly, where
we came to an anchor, in order to get water and fresh
provisions, which the people there, who are very cour-
teous and civil in their manners, supplied us with will-
ingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in
all their agreements and bargains, which is what we
did not find among other people, and may be owing
to the remains of Christianity which was once planted
here by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a tes-
timony of what I have often observed, viz. that the
Christian religion always civilizes the people and reforms their manners, where it is received, whether it works
saving effects upon them or no. From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast
of China at an equal distance, till we knew we were
beyond all the ports of China where our European
ships usually come; being resolved, ifpossible, not to
R 4 fall
ADVENTURES OF
sall into any of their hands, especially in this country;
where, as our circumstances were, we could not fail of
being entirely ruined. Being now come to the latitude of 30 deg. we resolv-
ed to put into the first trading port we should come at;
and standing in for the shore, a boat came off two lea-
gues to us, with an.old Portuguese pilot on board, who
knowing us to bean European ship, came to offer his
service, which, indeed, we were glad of, and took him
on board; upon which, without asking us whither we
would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent
it back. I thought it was now so much in our choice to make
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began to
talk to him about carrying us to the gvdph of Nanquin,
which is the most northern part of the coast of China.
The old man said he knew the gulph of Nanquin very
well, but smiling, asked us what we would do there?
I told him we would sell our cargo and purchase
China wares, callicoes, raw-silks, tea, wrought silks,
&c. and so would return by the same course we came.
He told us our best port had been to have put in at
Macao, where we could not have failed of a market for
our opium to our satisfaction, and might for our money
have purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as
we could at Nanquin. Not being able to put the old man out of his talk,
of which he was very opinionated or conceited, I told
him we were gentlemen as well as merchants, and that
we had a mind to go and see the great city of Peking,
and the famous court of the monarch of China. Why
then, says the old man, you should go to Ningpo,
where, by the river which runs into the sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the great canal.
This canal is a navigable stream, which goes through the
heart of that vast empire of China, crosses all the rivers,
passes some considerable hills by the help of sluices and
gates, and goes up to the city of Peking, being in
length near 270 leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not
our business now; the great question is, if you can
carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from whence we
can travel to Peking afterwards? Yes, yes, he said, he
could do so very well, and that there was a great Dutch
ship gone up that way just before. This gave me a lit-
tle shock, for a Dutch ship was now our terror, and
we had much rather have met the devil, at least if he
had not come in too frightful a figure; and we depend-
ed upon it that a Dutch ship would be our destruction,
for we were in no condition to fight them; all the ships
they trade with into those parts being of great bur-
then, and of much greater force than we were. The old man found me a little confused, and under
some concern, when he named a Dutch ship, and said to
me, Sir, you need be under no apprehensions of the
Dutch; I suppose they are not now at war with your
nation? No, says I, that's true; but I know not what
liberties men may take when they are out of the reach
of the laws of their own country. Why, says he, you
are no pirates, what need you fear? They will not med-
dle with peaceable merchants sure.
If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up
into my face at that word, it was hindered by some
stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circulate it,
for it put me into the greatest disorder and confusion imaginable;
imaginable: nor was it possible for me to conceal it so,
but the old man easily perceived it. Sir, says he, I find you are in some disorder in your
thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which way
you think sit, and depend upon it, I'll do you all the
service I can. Why, Seignior, said I. it is true, I am a
little unsettled in my resolution at this time, whither to
go in particular; and I am something more so for what
you said about pirates. I hope there are no pirates in
these seas; we are but in an ill condition to meet with
them, for you see we have but a small force, and but
very weakly manned.
. O Sir, says he, don't be concerned, I do not know
that there have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen
years, except one, which was seen, as I hear, in the bay
of Siam, about a month since; but you maybe assured she is gone to the southward; nor was she a ship of any
great force, or fit for the work: she was not built for a privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crew
that was on board, after the captain and some of his men
had been murdered by the Malayans, at or near the
island of Sumatra.
What! said I, seeming to know nothing of the
matter, did they murder the captain? No, said he, I
don't understand that they murdered him; but as they
afterwards ran away with the ship, it is generally believed that they betrayed him into the hands of the
Malayans, who did murder him; and perhaps they
procured them to do it. Why then, said I, they de-
serve death as much as if they had done it themselves.
Nay, says the old man, they do deserve it; and they
will certainly have it, if they light upon any English
pr Dutch ship; for they have all agreed together, that
if they meet that rogue they'll give him no quarter.
But, said I to him, you say the pirate is gone out of
these seas; how can they meet with him then? Why
that's true, says he, they do say so; but he was, as I tell
you, in the bay of Siam, in the river Cambodia; and was
discovered there by some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were left on shore when they ran
away with her; and some English and Dutch traders
being in the river, they were within a little of taking
him: nay, said he, if the foremost boats had been well
seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken him-;
but he finding only two boats within reach of him,
tacked about, and fired at those two, and disabled them before the others came up, and then standing off to sea,
the others were not able to follow him, and so he
got away; but they have all so exact a description of
the ship, that they will be sure to know her; and
wherever they find her they have vowed to give no
quarter either to the captain or seamen, but to hang
them all up at the yard-arm.
What! says I, will they execute them right or
wrong; hang them first, and judge them afterwards?
O Sir, says the old pilot, there is no need to make a
formal business of it with such rogues as those; let
them tie them back to back, and set them a diving, 'tis
no more than they deserve.
I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that
he could do no harm, so that I turned short upon
him: Well now, Seignior, said I, this is the very rea-
son why I would have you carry us up to Nanquin, and
not put back to Macao, or to any other part of tha
fountry where the English or Dutch ships come; fop be
252
ADVENTURES OF
he it known to you, Seignior, those captains of the
English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud,
insolent fellows, that neither know what belongs to
justice, or how to behave themselves as the laws of God
and nature direct; but being proud of their offices, and
not understanding their power, they would act the
murderers to punish robbers; would take upon them to
insult men falsely accused, and determine them guilty
without due inquiry: and perhaps I may live to bring
some of them to account for it, when they may be
taught how justice is to be executed; and that no man
ought to be treated as a criminal till some evidence may
be had of the crime, and that he is the man. With this I told him that this was the very ship they
attacked, and gave him a full account of the skirmish
we had with their boats, and how foolishly and coward-
like they behaved. I told him all the story of our buy-
ing the ship, and how the Dutchman served us. I
told him the reasons I had to believe the story of kill-
ing the master by the Malayans was true, as also the
running away with the ship; but it was all a fiction of
their own to suggest that the men had turned pirates,
and they ought to have been sure it was so before they
had ventured to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to
resist them; adding, that they would have the blood of
those men, whom we killed there in just defence,
to answer for. The old man was amazed at this relation, and told
us we were very much in the right to go away to the
north; and that if he might advise us, it should be to
sell the ship in China, which we might very well do,
and buy or build another in the country; and, said he,
though you will not get so good a ship, yet you may get
get one able enough to carry you and all your goods
back again to Bengal, or any where else. I told him I
would take his advice when I came to any port where I
could find a ship for my turn, or get any customer to
buy this. He replied, I should meet with customers
enough for the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese
junk would serve me very well to go back again; and
that he would procure me people both to buy one and
sell the other.
Well, but Seignior, says I, as you say they know the
ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures,
be instrumental to bring some honest innocent men
into a terrible broil, and perhaps to be murdered in
cold blood; for wherever they find the ship, they will
prove the guilt upon the men, by proving this was the
ship, and so innocent men may probably be over-
powered and murdered. Why, says the old man, I'll
find out a way to prevent that also; for as I know all
those commanders you speak of very well, and shall see
them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to
rights in the thing, and let them know that they had
been so much in the wrong; that though the people
who were on board at first might run away with the
ship, yet it was not true that they had turned
pirates; and that, in particular, these were not the men
that first went off with the ship, but innocently bought
her for their trade; and I am persuaded they will so far believe me, as at least to act more cautiously for the time
to come. While these things were passing between us, by way
of discourse, we went forward directly for Nanquin,
and in about thirteen days sail, came to an anchor at the
south-west point of the great gulf of Nanquin, where by
by the way, I came by accident to understand that two Dutch ships were gone the length before me, and that
I should certainly fall into their hands. I consulted my
partner again in this exigency, and he was as much at a
loss as I was, and would very gladly have been safeon
shore almost any where: however, I was not in such per-
plexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was
no creek or harbour which I might put into and pur-
sue my business with the Chinese privately, and be in
no danger of the enemy. He told me, if I would sail to
the southward about forty-two leagues, there was a lit-
tle port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mis-
sion usually landed from Macao, on^their progress to
teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, and where
no European ships ever put in; and if I thought to put
in there, I might consider what farther course to take
when I was on shore. He confessed, he said, it was
not a place for merchants, except that at some certain
times they had a kind of a fair there, when the mer-
chants from Japan came over thither to buy the Chi-
nese merchandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this place; the name of
the port, as he called it, I may perhaps spell wrong,
for I do not particularly remember it, having lost this,
together with the names of many other places set down
in a little pocket-book, which was spoiled by the water
by an accident; but this I remember, that the Chinese
or Japanese merchants we corresponded with called it
by a different name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it as above, Quinchang. As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this
place, we weighed the next day, having only gone
twice on shore where we were to get fresti water, on both
both which occasions the people of the country were very civil to us, and brought us abundance of things
to sell to us, I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea,
rice, and some fowls, but nothing without money. We came to the other port (the wind being contrary)
not till five days, but it was very much to our satisfaction; and I was joyful, and I may say thankful, when
I set my foot on shore, resolving, and my partner too,
that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and effects
any other way, though not every way to our satisfaction, we would never set one foot on board that unhappy
vessel more, and indeed I must acknowledge, that of
all the circumstances of life that ever I had any experi-
ence of, nothing makes mankind so completely mise-
rable as that of being in constant fear. Well does the
scripture say, the fear of man brings a snare; it is a life
of death, and the mind is so entirely oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief. Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy,by heightening every danger, representing the English
and Dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing rea-
son, or of distinguishing between honest men and
rogues; or between a story calculated for our own turn,
made out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a true
genuine account of our whole voyage, progress and de-
sign; for we might many ways have convinced any
reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the goods
we had on board, the course we steered, our frankly
showing ourselves, and entering into such and such ports; and even our very manner, the force we had,
the number of men, the few arms, little ammunition,
short provisions; all these would have served to con-
vince any men that we were no pirates. The opium and
and other goods we had on board would make it appear
the ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it
was said, had the names of all the men that were in the ship, might easily see that we were a mixture of English,
Portuguese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen on
board. These, and many other particular circumstances, might have made it evident to the understanding of any
commander, whose hands we might fall into, that we
were no pirates. But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our
understandings, and set the imagination at work to
form a thousand terrible things that perhaps might ne-
ver happen. We first supposed, as indeed every body
had related to us, that the seamen on board the Eng-
lish and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were
so enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially at
our beating off their boats and escaping, that they would
not give themselves leave to inquire whether we were
pirates or no; but would execute us offhand, as we
call it, without giving us any room fora defence. We
reflected that there really so much apparent evi-
dence before them, that they would scarce inquire after
any more; asfirst, that the ship was certainly the same, and that some of the seamen among them knew her, and
had been on board her; and, secondly, that when we
had intelligence at the river of Cambodia that they
were coming down to examine us, we fought their
boats and fled; so that we made no doubt but they were
as fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we were satisfied
of the contrary; and, as I often said, I know not but
I should have been apt to have taken those circumstan-
ces for evidence, if the tables were turned, and my cafe
was
was theirs, and have made no scruple of cutting all the
crew to pieces, without believing, or perhaps consider-
ing, what they might have to offer in their defence. But let that be how it will, these were our apprehen-
sions; and both my partner and I scarce slept a night
without dreaming of halters and yard-arms, that is to
say, gibbets;"of fighting and being taken; of killing, and being killed: and one night I was in such a fury
in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded us,
and I was knocking one of their seamen down, that I
struck my double fist against the side of the cabin I lay in with such a force, as wounded my hand grievously,
broke my knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so
that it awaked me out of my sleep. Another apprehension I had, was of the cruel usage
we might meet with from them if we fell into
their hands: then thestory of Amboyna came into my
head, and how the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as
they did our countrymen there, and make some of our
men, by extremity of torture, confess those crimes they
never were guilty of, or own themselves and all of us
to be pirates, and so they would put us to death with
a formal appearance of justice; and that they might be
tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo,
which was worth four or five thousand pounds, put
all together. These things tormented me and my partner too,
night and day; nor did we consider that the captains of
ships have no authority to act thus; and if we had sur-
rendered prisoners to them, they could not answer the
destroying us, or torturing us, but would be accounta-
ble for it when they came to their own country; this, t
fay, gave me no satisfaction; for if they will act thus Vol. II. S with
with us, what advantage would it be to us that they
should be called to an account for it? or if we were first to be murdered, what satisfaction would it be to us to have them punished when they came home?I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections
I now had upon the vast variety of my particular cir-
cumstances; how hard I thought it was, that I, who had
spent forty years in a life of continued difficulties, and
was at last come, as it were, to the port or haven which
all men drive at, viz. to have rest and plenty, should be
a volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy choice;
and that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my
youth, should now come to be hanged in my old age,
and in so remote a place, for a crime which I was not
in the least inclined to, much less guilty of. After these thoughts, something of religion would
come in; and I should be considering that this seemed
to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence, and
I ought to look upon it and submit to it as such; that although I was innocent as to men, I was far from being
innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and
examine what other crimes in my life were most obvious
tome, and for which Providence might justly inflict
this punishment as a retribution; and that I ought to
submit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck, if it had
pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me. In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take
its place, and then I would be talking myself up to vi-
gorous resolutions; that I would not be taken to be
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in
cold blood; that it were much better to have fallen into
the hands of the savages, though I was sure they would
feast upon me when they had taken me, than those, who
Who would perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman
tortures and barbarities; that in the case of the savages I
always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp, and why
should I not do so now, seeing it was much more dread-
ful, to me at least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten by
men; for the savages, give them their due, would not
eat a man till he was killed and dead, but that these
men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death. When-
ever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself
into a kind of fever with the agitation of a supposed
fight; my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as
if I was engaged, and I always resolved to take no
quarter at their hands: but even at last, if I could re-
sist no longer, I would blow up the ship and all that
was in her, and leave them but little booty to boast of.
By how much the greater weight the anxieties and
perplexities of these things were to our thoughts while
we were at sea, by so muchthe greater was our satis-
faction when we saw ourselves on shore; and my part-
ner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy load
upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and
found that he was not able to stand longer under it; but
that the Portuguese pilot came and took it off his back,
and the hill disappeared, the ground before him appearing all smooth and plain; and truly it was so: we were all
like men who had a load taken off their backs. For my part, I had a weight taken off from my heart that it was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said
above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship.
When we came on shore, the old pilot, who was now
our friend, got us a lodging and a warehouse for our
goods, which, by the way, was much the same: it was S a a little
a little house, or hut, with a larger house adjoining to
it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it
seems, there were not a few in that country; however,
the magistrates allowed us a little guard, and we had a
soldier with a kind of halberd, or half-pike, who stood
centinel at our door; to whom we allowed a pint of
rice, and a little piece of money, about the value of
three-pence per day, so that our goods were kept very
safe. The sair ar mart usually kept in this place, had been over some time; however, we found that there were
three or four junks in the river, and two Japanners, I
mean ships from Japan, with goods which they had
bought in China, and were not gone away, having
some Japanese merchants on shore. The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us,
was to get us acquainted with three missionary Ro-
mish priests who were in town, and who had been
there some time converting the people to Christianity;
but we thought they made but poor work of it, and
made them but sorry Christians when they had done; however, that was none of our business. One of these
was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon;
another was a Portuguese, and the third a Genoese; but Father Simon was courteous, easy in his manner,
and very agreeable company; the other two were more
reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously
to the work they came about, viz. to talk with, andin*-sinuate themselves among, the inhabitants, wherever
they had opportunity. We often ate and drank with
those men; and though, I must confess, the conversion,
as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so far '.' \ from
from the true conversion required to bring heathen
people to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount
to little more than letting them know the name of
Christ, and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and
her Son, in a tongue which they understand not, and
to cross themselves, and the like; yet it must be con-
fessed that these religious, whom we call missionaries,
have a firm belief that these people will be saved, and
that they are the instruments of it; and, on this account,
they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage, and
the hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes
death itself, with the most violent tortures, for the sake
of this work. But to return to my story: This French priest, Fa-
ther Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of the
chief of the mission, to go up to Peking, the royal seat of the Chinese Emperor, and waited only for another
priest, who was ordered to come to him from Macao,
to go along with him, and we scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that journey; telling me
how he would show me all the glorious things of that
mighty empire, and, among the rest, the greatest city in
the world: a city, said he, that your London and our
Paris put together, cannot be equal to. This was the
city of Peking, which, I confess, is very great, and in-
finitely full of people; but as I looked on those things
with different eyes from other men, so I shall give my
opinion of them in few words, when I come in the
course of my travels to speak more particularly of
them.
But first, I come to my friar or missionary: dining
with him one day, and being very merry together, I
showed some little inclination to go with him, and he

ADVENTURES OF
presled me and my partner very hard, and with a great
many persuasions, to consent. Why, Father Simon,
says my partner, should you desire our company so
much? you know we are heretics, and you do not love
us, nor cannot keep us company with any pleasure. O,
says he, you may perhaps be good catholics in time;
my business here is to convert heathens, and who
knows but I may convert you too. Very well, sather, -
said I, so you will preach to us all the way. I will not
be troublesome to you, says he; our religion does not
divest us of good manners: besides, says he,we are
here like countrymen; and so we are, compared to the
place we are in; and if you are Hugonots, and I a Ca-
tholic, we may all be Christians at last; at least, said
he,we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so,
without being uneasy to one another. I liked this part
of his discourse very well, and it began to put me in
mind of my priest that I had left in the Brazils; but
this Father Simon did not come up to his character by
a great deal; for though Father Simon had no appear-
ance of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not
that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere afr
section to religion, that my other good ecclesiastic had,
of whom I have laid so much. But to leave him a little, though he never left us,
nor soliciting us to go with him; we had some-
thing else before us at first, for we had all this while
our ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful what we should do, for we
were now in a place of very little business; and once I
was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam, and
the city of Nanquin; but Providence seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, to concern itself in our affairs;
affairs; and I was encouraged, from this very time, to
think I should one way or other get out of this tangled
'circumstance, and be brought home to my own country
again, though I had not the least view of the manner;
and when I began to think of it, could not imagine by
what method it was to be done; providence, I say, be-
gan hereto clear up our way a little: and the first thing
that offered was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought
a Japan merchant to us, who inquired what goods we
3iad; and in the first place, he bought all our opium,
and gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold
by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and
some in small wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces
each. While we were dealing with him forour opium, it came into my head that he might perhaps deal for
the ship too, and I ordered the interpreter to propose
it to him; he shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it
was first proposed to him; but in a few days after he
came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his in-
terpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make to me,
and that was this: he had bought a great quantity of
goods of us, when he had no thoughts of proposals
made to him of buying the ship; and that, therefore, he
had not money enough to pay for the ship: but if I
would let the same men who were in the ship navigate
her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan; and would
send them from thence to the Philippine islands with
another loading, which he would pay the freight of before they went from Japan; and that at their return
he would buy the ship. I began to listen to his propo-
sal, and so eager did my head still run upon rambling,
that I could not but begin to entertain a notion of go-
ing myself with him, and so to sail from the Philippine
S 4 islands,
ADVENTURES OF
islands, away to the South Seas ; and accordingly I asked the Japanese merchant if he would not hire us to
the Philippine islands, and discharge us there. He said,
No, he could not do that, for then he could not have
the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in
Japan, he said,at the ship's return. Well, still I was for
taking him at that proposal, and going myself; but
my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me from it,
representing the dangers, as well of the seas as of the Ja-
panese, who are a salse, cruel and treacherous people;
and then of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more
false, cruel, more treacherous than they. But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a con-
clusion: the first thing we had to do, was to con-
sult with the captain of the ship, and with his men,
and know if they were willing to go to Japan: and while I was doing this, the young man whom my ne-
phew had left with me as my companion for my travels came to me, and told me that he thought that voyage
promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect
of advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook
it; but that if I would not, and would give him leave,
he would go as a merchant, or how I pleased to order
him; that if ever he came to England, and I was there
and alive, he would render me a faithful account of his
success, and it should be as much mine as I pleased. I was really loth to part with him; but considering the prospect of advantage, which was really considerable,
and that he was a young fellow as likely to do well in
it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go: but first I
told him I would consult my partner, and give him an
answer the next day. My partner and I discoursed
about it, and my partner made a most generous offer; he
told me—You know it has been an unlucky ship, and we resolve not to go to sea in it again; if your stew-
ard,so he called my man, will venture the voyage, I
will leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him
make the best of it; and if we live to meet in England,
and he meets with success abroad, he shall account for
one half of the profits of the ship's freight to us; the
other shall be his own.
If my partner, who was no way concerned with my
young man, made him such an offer, I could do no
less than offer him the same: and all the ship's com-
pany being willing to go with him, we made over half
the ship to him in property, and took a writing from
him, obliging him to account for the other; and away
he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very
punctual honest man to him; protected him at Japan,
and got him a licence to come on shore, which the
Europeans in general have not lately obtained; paid
him his freight very punctually, sent him to the Phi-
lippines, loaded with Japan and China wares, and a
supercargo of their own, who trafficking with the Spa-
niards, brought back European goods again, and a
great quantity of cloves and other spices; and there he
was not only paid his freight very well, and at a very
good price, but being willing to sell the ship then,
the merchant furnished him goods on his own account,
that for some money, and some spices of his own which
he brought with him, he went back to the Manillas
to the Spaniards, where he sold his cargo very well.
Here, having got a good acquaintance at Manilla,
he got his ship made a free ship; and the governor
of Manilla hired him to go toAcapulco in America,
on the coast of Mexico, and gave him a licence to landthere
here, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass in any
Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and
there he sold his ship; and having there also obtained
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he sound
means,"somehow or other, to get to Jamaica, with all
his treasure; and about eight years after came to Eng-
land exceeding rich, of which I shall take notice in
its place; in the mean time, I return to our particular
affairs. Being now to part with the ship and ship's company, it
came before us, of course, to consider what recompence
we should give to the two men that gave us such time-
ly notice of the design against us in the river Cambodia.
The truth was, they had done us a considerable service,
and deserved well at our hands; though, by the way,
they were a couple of rogues too; for as they believed
the story of our being pirates, and that we had really
run away with the ship, they came down to us not only
to betray the design that was formed against us, but to
go to sea with us as pirates; and one of them confessed
afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going a
roguing brought him to doit: however, the service
they did us was not the less; and, therefore, as I had
promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered the mo-
ney to be paid them which they said was due to them
on board their respective ships; over and above that, I
gave each of them a small sum of money in gold, which
contented them very well; then I made the English-
man gunner in the ship, the gunner being now made
second mate and purser; the Dutchman I made boat-
swain; so they were both very well pleased, and proved
very serviceable, being both able seamen, and very
flout fellows. I We
We were now on shore in China: if I thought my-
self banished and remote from my own country at Ben-
gal, where I had many ways to get home for my mo-
ney, what could I think of myself now, when I was
got about a thousand leagues farther off from home,
and perfectly destitute of all manner of prospect of re-
turn. All we had for it was this, that in about four
months time there was to be another fair at the place
where we were, and then we might be able to pur-
chase all sorts of the manufactures of the country, and
withal might possibly find some Chinese junks or
vessels from Tonquin, that would be to be sold, and
would carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This
I liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides, as our
particular persons were not obnoxious, so if any Eng-
lish or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might
have an opportunity to load our goods, and get passage
to some other place in India, nearer home. Upon these
hopes we resolved to continue here; but, to divert our-
selves, we took two or three journeys into the coun-
try. First, we went ten days journey, to the city of
Nanquin, a city well worth seeing indeed; they say it
has a million of people in it: it is regularly built, the
streets all exactly straight, and cross one another in
direct lines, which gives the figure of it great advantage. But when I come to compare the miserable people of
these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner
of living, their government, their religion, their wealth,
and their glory, as some call it, I must confess that I
scarcely think it worth my while to mention them here. It
ADVENTURES OF
It is very observable, that we wonder at the grandeur,
the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the government,
the manufactures, the commerce, and conduct of these
people; not that it is to be wondered at, or indeed in
the least to be regarded ; but because, having first a true
notion of the barbarity of those countries, the rudeness
and the ignorance that prevails there, we do not expect
to find any such thing so sar off.
Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to
the universal commerce of England, Holland, France, and Spain? What are their cities to ours, for wealth,
strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and insinite
is8
large and powerful navies? Our city of London has
more trade than half their mighty empire: one English,
Dutch, or French man of war of 80 guns, would be
able to fight almost all the shipping belonging to Chi-
na: but the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the
power of their government, and the strength of their
armies, may be a little surprising to us, because, as I
have said, considering them as a barbarous nation of
pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect
such things among them: and this indeed is the advan-
tage with which all their greatness and power is repre-
sented to us; otherwise, it is in itself nothing at all; for
what I have said of their ships, so may be said of their ar-
mies and troops; all the forces of their empire, though
they were to bring two millions of men into the field to-
gether, would be able to do nothingbut ruin the coun-
try, and starve themselves, if they were to besiege a
strong town in Flanders, or to fight a disciplined army;
one
one good line of German cuirassiers, or of French ca-
valry, might withstand all the horse of China; a mil-
lion of their foot could not stand before one embattled
body of our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded,
though they were to be one to twenty in number;
nay, I do not boast if I say that 30,000 German or
English foot, and 10,000 horsewell managed, could de-
feat all the forces of China; and so of our fortified
towns, and of the art of our engineers in assaulting and
defending towns: there is not a fortified town in Chi-
na could hold out one month against the batteries and
attacks of an European army; and, at the same time, all
the armies of China could never take such a town as
Dunkirk, provided it was not starved; no, not in a ten years siege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but they
are aukward and uncertain in their going off; and their
powder has but little strength. Their armies are badly
disciplined, and want skill to attack, or temper to re-
treat; and therefore I must confess, it seemed strange to
me, when I came home, and heard our people say such
fine things of the power, glory, magnificence,
and trade of the Chinese; because, as far as I saw, they
appeared to be a contemptible herd or crowd of ig-
norant sordid slaves, subjected to a government quali-
fied only to rule such a people: and were not its dis-
tance inconceivably great from Muscovy, and the
Muscovite empire in a manner as rude, impotent, and
ill-governed as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with
ease drive them all out of their country, and conquer them in one campaign: and had the Czar (who is now
agrowingprince) sallen this way, instead ofattackingthe.
warlike Swedes, and equally improved himself in the
art of war, as they say he has done; and if none of the powers
powers of Europe would have envied or interrupted
him, he might by this time have been emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at
Narva, when the latter was not one to six in number.
As their strength and their grandeur, so their naviga-
tion, commerce and husbandry is very imperfect, com-
pared to the same things in Europe: also in their
knowledge, their learning, and in their skill in the sci-
ences, they are either very awkward or defective, though
they have globes and spheres, and a smattering of the
knowledge of themathematics, and think they know
more than all the world besides; but they know little of
the motions of the heavenly bodies; and so grossly and
absurdly ignorant are their common psople, that when
the sun is eclipsed, they think a great dragon has as-
saulted it, and is going to run away with it; and they sall
a clattering with all the drums and kettles in the coun-
try, to fright the monster away, just as we do to hive a
swarm of bees. As this is the only excursion of the kind which I
have made in all the accounts I have given of my tra-
vels, so I shall make no more such; it is none of my
business, nor any part of my design, but to give an ac-
count of my own adventures through a life of inimita-
ble wanderings, and a long variety of changes, which,
perhaps, few that come after me will have heard the
like of: I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty
places, desert countries, and numerous people I have
yet to pass through, more than relates to my own story,
and which my concern among them will make neces-
sary. I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart
of China, about thirty degrees north of the line, for
we were returned from Nanquin: I had, indeed, a mind to
to see the city of Peking, which I had heard so much
of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to do it. At
length his time of going away being set, and the other
missionary who was to go with him being arrived from
Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve either
to go or not; so I referred it wholly to my partner,
and left it wholly to his choice, who at length resolved
it in the affirmative, and we prepared for our journey.
We set out with very good advantage, as to finding the
way, for we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of
their Mandarins, a kind of viceroy or principal magis-
trate in the province where they reside, and who take
great state upon them, travelling with great attendance,
and with great homage from the people, who are some-
times greatly impoverished by them, being obliged to
furnish provisions for them and all their attendants in
their journeys. That which I particularly observed, as
to our travelling with his baggage, was this, that
though we received sufficient provisions both for our-
selves and our horses from the country, as belonging to
theMaiidarin, yet we were obliged to pay for everything
we had, after the market price of the country, and the
Mandarin's steward collected it duly from us; so that
our travelling in the retinue of the Mandarin, though
it was a very great kindness to us, was not such a
mighty favour in him, but was a great advantage
to him, considering there were above thirty other peo-
ple travelled in the same manner besides us, under the
protection of his retinue; so that I say, it was a great
advantage to him,for the country furnished all the pro-
visions for nothing to him, and he took our money
for them. We
We were twenty-five days travelling to Peking,
through a country infinitely populous, but I think
badly cultivated; the husbandry, the economy, and
the way of living miserable, though they boast so much
of the industry of the people; I say miserable, if com-
pared with our own, but not so to these poor wretches,
who know no other. The pride of the people is infi-
nitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
in some parts, which adds to that which I call their mi-
sery; and I must needs think the naked savages of
America live much more happy than the poorer sort of
these, because as they have nothing, so they desire no-
thing; whereas these are proud and insolent, and in
the main are in many parts mere beggars and drudges; their ostentation'is inexpressible; and if they can, they
love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is
to the last degree ridiculous, as well as the contempt
of all the world but themselves. I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards
in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary
than here; and yet the roads here are well paved and
well kept, and very convenient for travellers: but no-
thing was more awkward to me than to see such a
haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst of
the grossest simplicity and ignorance; and my friend Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these
occasions, to see the beggarly pride of these people: for
example, coming by the house of a country gentleman,
as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues off the
city of Nanquin, we had first of all the honour to ride
with the master of the house about two miles; the state
he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mix-
ture of pomp and poverty. 2 :His
His habit was very proper for a scaramouch, or merry
Andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging-sleeves,
tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on every side; it co-
vered a taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher's, and which
testified that his honour must be a most exquisite
sloven.
' His horse was but a poor, starved, hobbling crea-
ture, and he had two slaves followed him on foot to
drive the poor creature along; he had a whip in his
hand, and he belaboured the beast as fast about the head
as his slaves did about the tail; and thus he rode by us,
with about ten or twelve servants, going from the city
to his country feat, about half a league before us. We
travelled on gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode
away before us, and as we stopped at a village about an
hour to refresh us, when we came by the country feat of
this great man, we saw him in a little place before his
door, eating his repast. It was a kind of a garden, but
he was easy to be seen; and we were given to under-' stand, that the more we looked on him, the better he
would be pleased. He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto,
which effectually shaded him over the head, and on the
south side; but under the tree was also placed a large
umbrella, which made that part look well enough: he
sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and had his meat brought him by two
women slaves; he had two more, one of which fed the
squire with a spoon, and the other held the dish with
one hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his wor-
ship's beard and taffaty vest.
Thus leaving the poor wretch to please himself with
our looking at him, as if we-adtnired his pomp, though
Vol II. T we
ADVENTURES OF
we really pitied and contemned him, we pursued our
journey; only Father Simon had the curiosity to stay to
inform himself what dainties the country justice had to
feed on in all his state, which he said hehad the honour
to taste of, and which was, I think, a mess of boiled
rice, with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag
filled with green pepper, and another plant which they
have there, something like our ginger, but smelling
like musk, and tasting like mustard; all this was put
together, and a small piece of lean mutton boiled in
it, and this was his worship's repast; four or five ser-
vants more attended at a distance, who, we supposed,
were to eat of the same after their master. As for our Mandarin with whom we travelled, he
was respected as a king, surrounded always with his
gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances with
such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance;
but this I observed, that there was not a horse in his
retinue but that our carriers pack-horses in England seemed to me to look much better; though it was hard
to judge rightly, for they were so covered with equipage,
mantles, trappings, &c. that we could scarce see any
thing but their feet and their heads as they went along. I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and per-
plexity that I have given an account of being over, I
had no anxious thought about me, which made this
journey the pleasanter to me; nor had I any ill accident
attended me, only in the pasting or fording a small river my horse fell, and made me free of the country, as they
call it, that is to say, threw me in; the place was not
deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention it, because
it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the
names of several people and places which I had occasion to
S75
Temember, and which, not taking due care of, the
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be read, to my great loss as to the names of some places I touch-
ed at in this voyage orjourney. At length we arrived at Peking; I had nobody with
me butthe youth whom my nephew the captainhad given
me to attend me as a servant, and who proved very trusty
and diligent; and my partner had nobody with him but
one servant, who was a kinsman: as for the Portuguese
pilot, he being desirous so fee the court, we bore his
charges for his company, and to use him as an inter-
preter, for he understood the language of the country,
and spoke good French, and a little English; and indeed
this old man was a most useful implement to us every
where; for we had not been above a week at Peking,
when he came laughing: Ah, Seignior Inglese, fays
he, I have something to tell you will make your heart
glad. My heart glad, says I; what can that be? I don't
know any thing in this country can either give me joy
or grief, to any great degree. 'Yes, yes, said the old
man, in broken English, make you glad, me sorry.
Why, said I, will it make you sorry? Because, said he,
you have brought me here twenty-five days journey,
and will leave me to go back alone, and which way shall
I get to my port afterwards without a ship, without a
horse, without pecune: so he called money, being his
broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us
merry with. In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, preparing
to set out on their journey by land to Muscovy, within
four or five weeks, and he was sure we would take the
T % oppor-
ADVENTURES OF
opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind,
to go back all alone.. I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news,
and had scarce power to speak to him for some time;
but at last I turned to him, How do you know this, said
I? Are you sure it is true? Yes, says he; I met this
morning in the street an old acquaintance of mine, an
Armenian, who is among them; he came last from
Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin, where
I formerly knew him, but has altered his mind, and
is now resolved to go with the caravan to Moscow, and
so down the river Wolga to Astracan. Well, Seignior,
says I, do not be uneasy about being left to go back
alone; if this be a method for my return to England,
it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at all.
We then went to consult togetherwhat was to be done;
and I asked my partner what he thought of the pilot's
news, and whether it would suit with his affairs? He
told me he would do just as I would; for he had settled
all his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in
such good hands, that as we had made a good voyage
here, if he could vest it in China silks, wrought and
raw, such as might be worth the carriage, he would
be content to go to England, and then make his voyage
back to Bengal by the Company's ships. Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our
Portuguese pilot would go with us we would bear his
charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased: nor
indeed were we to be esteemed over generous in that
neither, if we had not rewarded him sarther, for the
service he had done us being really worth that and more;
for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he had
been like a broker for us on shore; and his procuring for
5
for us the Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds
in our pockets. So we consulted together about it, and
being willing to gratify him, which was but
doing him justice, and very willing also to have him
with us besides, for he was a most necessary man on all
occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined
gold, which, as I compute it, came to about 175I. ster-
ling, between us, and to bear all his charges, both for
himself and horse, except only a horse to carry his
goods. Having settled this between ourselves, we called
him to let him know what we had resolved. I told
him he had complained of our being to let him go
back alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolved
he should not go back at all; that as we had resolved to
go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved also he
should go with us; and that we called him to know his
mind. He shook his head, and said, it was a.long jour-
ney, and he had no pecune to carry him thither, or to
subsist himself when he came there. We told him we
believed it was so, and therefore we had resolved to do
something for him that should let him see how sensible
we were of the service he had done us, and also how
agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what we
had resolved to give him here, which he might lay out
as we would do our own; and that as for his charges, if
he would go with us we would set him safe on shore
(life and casualties excepted) either in Muscovy or Eng-
land, which he would, at our own charge, except only
the carriage of his goods. He received the proposal like
a man transported, and told us he would go with us
over the whole world; and so, in short, we all prepared
for our journey. However, as it was with us, so it
was with the other merchants; they had many things
T 3 to
ADVENTURES OF
to do; and instead of being ready in five weeks, it was
four months and some days before all things were got
together.
, It was the beginning of February, our style, when we
set out from Peking. My partner and the old pilot had
gone express back to the port where we had first put in,
to dispose of some goods which we had left there; and
I, with a Chinese merchant whom I had some knowledge of at.Nanquin, and who came to Peking on his
own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety
pieces of fine damasks, with about two hundred pieces
of other very fine silks of several sorts, some mixed
with gold, and had all these brought to Peking against
my partner's return: besides this, we bought a very
large quantity of raw silk, and some other goods, our
cargo amounting, in these goods only, to about 3500I.
sterling; which, together with tea, and some fine cali-
coes, and three camels loads of nutmegs and cloves,
loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides those
we rode upon; which, with two or three spare horses,
and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in
short, twenty-six camels and horses in our retinue. The company was very great, and, as near as
I can remember, made between three and four hundred
horse, and upwards of one hundred and twenty men,
very well armed, and provided for all events: for as the
eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs,
so are these by the Tartars; but they are not altogether
so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous, when they
prevail. The company consisted of people of several nations;
but there were above sixty of them merchants or inha-
bitants of Moscow, though of them some were Livo-
nian s;
nians; and, to our particular satissaction, five of them
were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great ex-
perience in business, and of very good substance. When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides,
who were five in number, called all the gentlemen and
merchants, that is to say, all the passengers except the
servants, to a great council, as they called it. At this
council every one deposited a certain quantity of money
to a common stock, for the necessary expence of buying
forage on the way, where it was not otherwise to be
had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses, and
the like: and here they constituted the journey, as they
call it, viz. they named captains and officers to draw us
all up, andgi vc the word of command, in case of an at-
tack, and give every one their turn of command; nor
was this forming us into order any more than what we
found needful upon the way, as shall be observed. The road all on this side of the country is very popu-
lous, and is full of potters and earth-makers, that is
to say, people that temper the earth for the China-
ware: and as I was coming along, our Portugal pilot,
who had always something or other to say to make us
merry, came sneering to me, and told me he would
show me the greatest rarity in all the country, and that
I should have this to say of China, after all the ill-hu-
moured things I had said of it, that I had seen one thing
which was not to be seen in all the world beside. I
was very importunate to know what it was: at last he
told me it was a gentleman's house built with China-
ware. Well, says I, are not the materials of their
buildings the product of their own country, and so it
is all China-ware, is it not? No, no, says he, I mean
it is a house all made of China-ware, such as you call it
T 4 in
ADVENTURES OF
in England, or as it is called in our country, porcelain.
Well, says I, such a thing maybe; how big is it?
Can we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we will buy it. Upon a camel! says the old pilot, hold-
ing up both his hands, why there is a family of thirty
people lives in it. I was then curious indeed to see it; and when I
came to it, it was nothing but this: it was a timber
house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with
lath and plaster; but all this plastering was really Chi-
na-ware, that is to say, it was plastered with the earth
that makes China-ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and paint-
ed with blue figures, as the large China-ware in Eng-
land is painted, and hard as if it had been burned: as
to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were
lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the little
square tiles we call galley-tiles in England, all made of
the finest China, and the figures exceeding fine, indeed,
with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold; many tiles making but one figure, but joined so artifi-
cially, the mortar being made of the same earth, that it
was very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of
the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard
as the earthen floors we have in use in several parts of
England; as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burned
and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets,
which were all as it were paved with the same tile:
the ceiling, and all the plastering work in the whole
house, were of the same earth; and, after all, the roof
was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep shin-
ing black. This
This was a China-warehouse indeed, truly and li-
terally to be called so, and had I not been upon the
journey, I could have staid some days to see and ex-
amine the particulars of it. They told me there were
fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all paved on
the bottom and sides with the same; and fine statues
set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the
porcelain earth, and burned whole. As this is one of the singularities of China, so they
may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they
excel in their accounts of it; for they told me such incre-
dible things of their performance in crockery-ware, for
such'it is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it could
not be true. They told me, in particular, of one work-
man that made a ship with all its tackle, and masts and
sails, in earthen-ware, big enough to carry fifty men.
If they had told me he launched it, and made a voyage
to Japan in it, I might have said something to it, indeed;
but as it was, I knew the whole of the story, which was,
in short, asking pardon for the word, that the fellow
lied; so I smiled, and said nothing to'it. This odd sight kept me two hours behind the cara-
van, for which the leader of it for the day fined me
about the value of three shillings; and told me, if it
had been three days journey without the wall, as it was
three days within, he must have fined me four times as
much, and made me ask pardon the next council day:
I promised to be more orderly; for indeed I found
afterwardsthe orders made for keeping all together were
absolutely necessary for our common safety. In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for a fortification against the Tartars; and a very
great work it is, going over hills and mountains in a needless
needless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the
precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or
indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no wall could
hinder them. They tell us its length is near a thousand
English miles, but that the country is five hundred in a
straight measured line, which the wall bounds, without
measuring the windings and turnings it takes; it is
about four fathoms high, and as many thick in some
places. I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without trespas-
sing our orders (for so long the caravan was in passing
the gate) to look at it on every side, near aud sar off, I
mean that was within my view; and the guide of our
caravan, who had been extolling it for the wonder of
the world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it.
I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep out the
Tartars; which he happened not to understand as I
meant it, and so took it for a compliment; but the old
pilot laughed: O, Seignior Inglese, says he, you speak
in colours. In colours, said I; what do you mean by
that? Why you speak what looks white this way, and
black that way; gay oneway, and dull another. You
tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars; you tell
me by that it is good for nothing but to keep out Tar-
tars. I understand you, Seignior Inglese ; 1 understand
you, says he; but Seignior 'Chinese understood you his
own way.
Well, says I, Seignior, do you think it would stand
out an army of our country people, with a good train of
artillery, or our engineers, with two companies of mi-
ners? Would not they batter it down in ten days, that
an army might enter in battalia; or blow it up in the air,
foundation and all, that there should be no sign of it left?
283
left? Aye, aye, says he, I know that. The Chinese
wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave him
leave to tell him a few days after, for we were then al-
most out of their country, and he was to leave us in a
little time afterward; but when he knew what I said,
he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no
more of his fine story of the Chinese power and great-
ness while he stayed.
After we passed this mighty wall, something like the
Picts, and so famous in Northumberland, built by the
Romans, we began to find the country thinly inhabited,
and the people rather confined to live in fortified towns
and cities, as being subject to the inroads and depreda-
tions of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and
therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants
of an open country. And here I began to find the necessity of keeping to-
gether in a caravan as we travelled, for we saw several
troops of Tartars roving about; but when I came to see them distinctly, I wondered more that the Chinese
empire could be conquered by such contemptible fel-
lows; for they are a mere hord orcroud of wild fellows,
keeping no order, and understanding no discipline or
manner of fight. Their horses are poor lean creatures, taught nothing,
and fit for nothing; and this we found the first day we
saw them, which was after we entered the wilder part
of the country. Our leader for the day gave leave for
about sixteen of us to go a-hunting, as they call it, and
what was this but hunting of (heep; however it may be
called hunting too, for the creatures are the wildest and
swiftest of foot that ever I saw of their kind; only they
will not run a great way, and you are sure of sport when you
you begin the chase, for they appear generally thirty or
forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep to-
gether when they fly. In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to
meet with about forty Tartars; whether they were hunt-
ing mutton as we were, or whether they looked for ano-
ther kind of prey, I know not; but as soon as they saw
us, one of them blew a kind of horn very loud, but
with a barbarous sound that I had never heard before,
and, by the way, never care to hear again; we all sup-
posed this was to call their friends about them, and so
it was; for in less than half a quarter of an hour, a troop
of forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance;
but our work was over first, as it happened. One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to
be amongst us, and as soon as he heard the horn he
told us in short,that we had nothing to do but to charge
them immediately, without loss of time; and drawing
us up in a line, he asked if we were resolved. We told
him we were ready to follow him; so he rode directly
towards them. They stood gazing at us like a mere
crowd, drawn up in no order, nor showing the face of
any order at all; but as soon as they saw us advance,
they let fly their arrows, which, however, missed us very
happily: it seems they mistook not their aim, but their
distance; for their arrows all fell a little short of us, but
with so true an aim, that had we been about twenty
yards nearer, we must have had several men wounded,
if not killed. Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great
distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets for
wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop, to fall in among them sword in hand, for so our bold Scot that
that led us directed. He was indeed but a merchant,
but he behaved with that vigour and bravery on this
occasion, and yet with such cool courage too, that I
never saw any man in action fitter for command. As
soon as we came up to them, we fired our pistols in their
faces, and then drew; but they fled in the greatest con-
fusion imaginable. The only stand any of them made
was on our right, where three of them stood, and, by
signs, called the rest to come back to them, having a
kind of scimitar in their hands, and their bows hang-
ing to their backs. Our brave commander, without
asking any body to follow him, gallops up close to
them, and with his fusee knocks one of them off his
horse, killed the second with his pistol, and the third
ran away; and thus ended our fight: but we had this
misfortune attending it, that all our mutton we
had in chase got away. We had not a man killed or
hurt; but as for the Tartars, there were about five of
them killed; how many were wounded we knew not; but
this we knew, that the other party were so frightened
with the noise of our guns, that they made off, and
never made any attempt upon us. We were all this while in the Chinese dominions,
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards;
but in about five days we entered a vast, great, wild de-
sart, which held us three days and nights march; and
we were obliged to carry our water with us in great lea-
thern bottles, and to encamp all night, just as I have
heard they do in the Desart of Arabia. I asked our guides whose dominion this was in; and
they told me thiswas a kind of border, that might be call-
ed no man's land, being a part of Great Karakathay,
or Grand Tartary ; but that however, it was all reckon-
ed
ADVENTURES OF
ed as belonging to China, but that there was no care taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves, and
therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole
march, though we were to go over some much larger. In passing this wilderness, which was at first very
frightful to me, we saw, two or three times, little par-
ties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their
own affairs, and to have no design upon us: and so,
like the man who met the devil, if they had nothing to
say to us, we had nothing to say to them ;— we let them
go-
Once, however, a party of them came so near as to
stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider if
they should attack us or not, we knew not; but when
we were passed at some distance by them, we made a
rear-guard of forty men, and stood ready for them, let-
ting the caravan pass half a mile or thereabouts before
us :—But after a while they marched off; only we found
they saluted us with five arrows at their parting, one
of which wounded a horse, so that it disabled him ; and
we left him the next day, poor creature, in great need
of a good sarrier. We supposed they might shoot more
arrows, which might fall short of us, but we saw no
more of them that time. We travelled near a month after this, the ways being,
not so good as at first, though still in the dominions
of the emperor of China, but lay for the most part in
villages, some of which were fortified, because of the
incursions of the Tartars. When we were come to one of these towns (it was about two days and a half
journey before we were to come to the city of Naum), I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to
be sold all the way upon that road, and horses also,
'such
such as they are, because so many caravans coming that
way they are often wanted. The person that I spoke to,
to get me a camel, would have gone and fetched one
for me; but I, like a fool, must be officious, and go
myself along with him: the place was about two miles
out of the village, where it seems they kept the camels
and horses feeding under a guard. I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese,
being very desirous of a little variety. When we came to
the place, it was a low marshy ground, walled round with
a stone wall, piled up dry, without mortar or earth
among it, like a park, with a little guard of Chinese
soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel, and
agreed for the price, I came away, and the Chineseman that went with me led the camel; when, on a sudden came up five Tartars on horseback; two of them seized
the fellow and took the camel from him, while the
other three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing
us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about
me but my sword, which could but ill defend me against
three horsemen. The first that came up stopped short
upon my drawing my sword, for they are arrant cow-
ards; but a second coming upon my left, gave me a
blow on the head, which I never felt till afterwards,
and wondered, when I came to myself, what was the
matter, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the
ground; but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence unlooked for, directs deliverances from
dangers which to us are unforeseen), had a pistol in
his pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars
neither; if they had, I suppose they would not have at-
tacked us; but cowards are always boldest when there
is no danger. The
The old man seeing me down, with a bold heart stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and laying
hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him down
by main force a little towards him with the other, shot
him in the head, and laid him dead upon the spot.
He then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped
us, as I said, and before he could come forward again,
made a blow at him with a scimitar which he always
wore, but missing the man, cut his horse in the side
of his head, cut one of the ears off by the root, and a
great slice down by the side of his face. The poor beast,
enraged with the wound, was no more to be governed
by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too 5
but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the
pilot's reach; and at some distance rising upon his
hind-legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him. In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had
lost the camel, but he had no weapon: however, see-
ing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon him,
away he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured weapon he had by his side, something like a
pole-axe, he wrenched it from him, and made shift to
knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old
man had the third Tartar to deal with still; and seeing
he did not fly, as he expected, nor come on to fight
him, as he apprehended, but stand stock-still, the old
man stood still too, and fell to work with his tackle, to
charge his pistol again; but as soon as the Tartar saw
the pistol, away he scoured, and left my pilot, my
champion I called him afterwards, a complete vic-
tory. By this time I was a little recovered; for I thought,
when I first began to wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep;
sleep; but, as I said above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was the mat-
ter; but a few moments after, as fenie returned, I felt
pain, though I did not know where; so I clapped my
hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then I
felt my head ache; and then, in a moment, memory
returned, and every thing was present to me again. I jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my
sword, but no enemies in view: I found a Tartar lie
dead, and his horse standing very quietly by him; and,
looking farther, I saw my champion and deliverer, who
had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming
back with his hanger in his hand: the old man, seeing
me on my feet, came running to me, and embraced
me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that I
had been killed; and seeing me bloody, would see
how I was hurt; but it was not much, only what we
call a broken head; neither did I afterwards find any
great inconvenience from the blow, for it was well again
in two or three days. We made no great gain however by this victory, for
we lost a camel and gained a horse; but that which
was remarkable, when we came back to the village, the
man demanded to be paid for the camel; I disputed it,
and it was brought to a hearing before the Chinese
judge of the place. To give him his due, he acted with
a great deal of prudence and impartiality; and, having
heard both sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man that
went with me to buy the camel, whose servant he was?
I am no servant, says he, but went with the stranger.
At whose request? says the justice. At the stranger's
request, says he. Why then, says the justice, you
were the stranger's servant for the time; and the camel Vol. II. . U mel
mcl being delivered to his servant, it was delivered to
him, and he must pay for it. I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word
to say: but, admiring to see such just reasoning upon
the consequence, and an accurate stating the case, I
paid willingly for the camel, and sent for another;
but, you may observe, I did not go to fetch it myself
any more, for I had had enough of that. The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese em-
pire; they call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications
go there; for this I will venture to affirm, that all the
Tartars in Karakathay, which, I believe, are some
millions, could not batter down the walls with their
bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it were at-
tacked with cannon, would be to make those who un-
derstand it laugh at you. We wanted, as I have said, above two days journey
of this city, when messengers were sent express to every
part of the road to tell all travellers and caravans to
halt till they had a guard sent for them; for that an
unusual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all,
had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the
city. This was very bad news to travellers ; however it
was carefully done of the governor, and we were very
glad to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly,
two days after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us
from a garrison of the Chinese, on our left, and three
hundred more from the city of Naum, and with these
we advanced boldly; the three hundred soldiers from
Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our
rear, and our men on each side of our camels, with
our baggage, and the whole caravan in the center; in
. this
this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought
ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand Mogul
Tartars, if they had appeared; but the next day, when
they did appear, it was quite another thing. It was early in the morning, when, marching from
a little well situated town, called Changu, we had a
river to pass, which we were obliged to ferry; and, had
the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the
time to have attacked us, when the caravan being
over, the rear-guard was behind; but they did not ap-
pear there. About three hours after, when we were entered upon
a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold,
by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy was at
hand; and they were at hand, indeed, for they came on
upon the spur. The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had
talked so big the day before, began to stagger; and
the soldiers frequently looked behind them, which is a
certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run
away. My old pilot was of my mind; and, being near
me, called out, Seignior Inglesc, says he, those fellows
must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if
the Tartars come on, they will never stand it. I
am of your mind, said I; but what must be done?
Done! says he, let fifty of our men advance, and
flank them on each wing, and encourage them; and
they will fight like brave fellows, in brave company;
but, without this, they will every man turn his back.
Immediately I rode up to our leader, and told him,
who was exactly of our mind; arid, accordingly, fifty
of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a line of rescue; and so we marched, U 2 leaving
leaving the last two hundred men to make a body by
themselves, and to guard the camels; only, that if
need were, they should send a hundred men to assist
the last fifty. In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable
company they were: how many we could not tell,
but ten thousand, we thought, was the least: a party
of them came on first and viewed our posture, tra-
versing the ground in the front of our line; and, as we
found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered the two
wings to advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on each
wing with their shot, which was done; but they
went off, and I suppose back, to give an account of the
reception they were like to meet with; and, indeed,
that salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately
halted, stood awhile to consider of it, and wheeling
off to the left, they gave over their design, and said no
more to us for that time; which was very agreeable to
our circumstances, which were but very indifferent for
a battle with such a number. Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or
Naum; we thanked the governor for his care of us,
and collected to the value of a hundred crowns, or
thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard
us; and here we rested one day. This is a garrison, indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept
here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the Mus-
covite frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do,
the Muscovites having abandoned that part of the coun-
try, which lies from this city west for about two
hundred miles, as desolate and unfit for use; and more
especially being so very remote, and so difficult to send troops
troops thither for its defence: for we had yet above two
thousand miles to Muscovy, properly so called. After this we passed several great rivers, and two
dreadful deserts; one of which we were sixteen days
passing over; and which, as I said, was to be called no
man's land; and, on the 13th of April, we came to the
frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think the first
town, or fortress, whichever it may be called, that be-
longed to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Arguna, be-
ing on the west side of the river Arguna. I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that
I was so soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian
country, or, at least, in a country governed by Chris-
tians; for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion,
but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such they
pretend to be, and are very devout in their way. It
would certainly occur to any man who travels the
world as I have done, and who had any power of re-
flection; I say, it would occur to him, to reflect what
a blessing it is to be brought into the world where the
name of God and a Redeemer is known, worshipped,
and adored: and not where the people, given up by
Heaven to strong delusions, worship the devil, and
prostrate themselves to stocks and stones; worship
monsters, elements, horrid-shaped animals, and sta-
tues or images of monsters. Not a town or city we
passed through but had their pagods, their idols, and
their temples, and ignorant people worshipping even
the works of their own hands. Now we came where, at least, a sace of the Chris-
tian worship appeared; where the knee was bowed to
jesus ; and, whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian
religion was owned, and the name of the true God U 3 Was
was called upon and adored, and it made my soul re-
joice to see it. I saluted the brave Scots merchant I
mentioned above with my first acknowledgment of
this; and taking him by the hand, I said to him,
Blefled be God, we are once again amongst Christians.
He smiled, and answered, Do not rejoice too soon,
countryman; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians; and but for the name of it, you may fee
very little of the substance for some months farther of
our journey. Well, says I, but ilill it is better than paganism and worshipping of devils. Why, I will tell you, fays
he, except the Russian soldiers in the garrisons, and a
few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all
the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles far-
ther, is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of
pagans; and so indeed we found it. We were now launched into the greatest piece of so-
lid earth, if I understand any thing of the surface of the
globe, that is to be found in any part of the world; we
had, at least, twelve thousand miles to the sea, eastward;
two thousand to the bottom of the Baltick sea, west-
ward; and above three thousand, if we left that sea and went on west, to the British and French channels;
we had full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian
sea, south; and about eight hundred to the Frozen sea,
north. Nay, if some people may be believed, there
might be no sea, north-east, till we came round the
pole, and consequently into the north-west, and so
had a continent of land into America, the Lord knows
where; though I could give some reasons why I believe
that to be a mistake. As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a good
while before we came to any considerable towns, we
had nothing to observe there but this; first, that all
the rivers run to the east: as I understood by the
charts, which some in our caravan had with them, it
was plain all those rivers ran into the great river Yamour, or Gamour: this river, by the natural course of
it, must run into the East sea, or Chinese Ocean. The
story they tell us, that the mouth of this river is
choked up with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz.
three feet about, and twenty or thirty feet high, I must
be allowed to say, I believe nothing of; but, as its na-
vigation is of no use, because there is no trade that way,
the Tartars, to whom alone, it belongs, dealing in no-
thing but cattle, so nobody, that ever I heard of, has
been curious enough either to go down to the mouth
of it in boats, or come up from the mouth of it in ships,
as far as I can sind; but this is certain, that this river
running east, in the latitude of about fifty degrees, car-
ries a vast concourse of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea there. Some leagues to the north of this river there are se-
veral considerable rivers, whose streams run as due
north as the Yamour runs east, and these are all found
to join their waters with the great river Tartarus,
named so from the northernmost nations of the Mogul
Tartars; who, as the Chinese say, were the first Tar-
tars in the world; and who, as our geographers al-
lege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred
story. These rivers running all northward, as well as all
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evi-
ls 4 dent
dent that the northern ocean bounds the land also on
that side; so that it does not seem rational in the least to think that the land can extend itself to join with
America on that side, or that there is not a communi-
cation between the northern and eastern ocean:
but of this I shall say no more; it was my observation at
that time, and therefore I take notice of it in this place. We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy
and moderate journeys, and were very visibly obliged to
the care the Czar of Muscovy has taken to have cities
and towns built in as many places as it is possible to
place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, something
like the stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in
the remotest countries of their empire; some of which I
had read, particularly, were placed in Britain, for the
security of commerce, and for the lodging travellers;
and thus it was here: for, wherever we came, though
at these towns and stations the garrisons and gover-
nors were Russians and professed Christians, yet the
inhabitants were mere pagans; sacrificing to idols, and
worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host
of heaven; and not only so, but were, of all the hea-
thens and pagans that I ever met with, the most barbarous, except only that they did noteat men's flesh,
as our savages of America did. Some instances of this we met with in the country
between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite domi-
nions, and a city of Tartars and Russians together,
called Nortziousky, in which is a continued desert or
forest, which cost us twenty days to travel over. In a
village, near the last of these places, I had the
curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is
most brutish and unsufferable: they had, I suppose, a great
great sacrifice that day; for there stood out, upon an old
stump of a tree, an idol made of wood, frightful as the
devil; at least, as any thing we can think of to represent
the devil can be made: it had a head not so
much as resembling any creature that the world ever
saw; ears as big as goats' horns, and as high; eyes as
big as a crown-piece; a nose like a crooked ram's-
horn; and a mouth extended four-cornered, like that
of a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's
under-bill: it was dressed up in the filthiest manner
that you could suppose: its upper garmentwas of sheep-
stcins, with the wool outward; a great Tartar bonnet
on the head, with two horns growing through it: it
was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other proportion of parts. This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the vil-
lage; and, when I came near to it, there were sixteen
or seventeen creatures, whether men or women I could
not tell, for they made no distinction by their habits;
these lay all flat upon the groundround this formida-
ble block of shapeless wood: I saw no motion among
them any more than if they had been all logs of wood,
like the idol; and, at first I really thought they had
been so; but, when I came a little nearer, they started
up upon their feet, and raised a howling cry, as if it
had been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked
away, as if they were displeased at our disturbing them.
A little way off from the idol, and at the door of a
tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins
dried, stood three butchers,—1 thought they were such;
when I came nearer to them, I found they had long
knives in their hands; and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one young bullock or steer.
steer. These, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless
log of an idol; and these three men, priests belonging
to it, and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the
people who brought the offering, and were making
their prayers to that stock. I confess, I was more moved at their stupidity and
brutish worship of a hobgoblin than ever I was at any
thing in my life; to see God's most glorious and best
creature, to whom he had granted so many advantages, even by creation above the rest of the works of his
hands, vested with a reasonable soul, and that soul
adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both to
honour his Maker, and be honoured by him, sunk and degenerated to a degree so very stupid as to prof- -trate itself to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary ob-
ject, dressed up by themselves, and made terrible to
themselves by their own contrivance, adorned only
with clouts and rags; and that this should be the effect
of mere ignorance, wrought up into hellish devotion by
the devil himself; who, envying to his Maker the homage and adoration of his creatures, had deluded them
into such sordid and brutish things as one would think
should shock nature itself! But what signified all the astonishment and reflection
of thoughts; thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes,
and there was no room to wonder at it, or think it im-
possible: all my admiration turned to rage, and I rode up
to the image or monster, call it what you will, and with
my sword made a stroke at the bonnet that was on its
head, and cut it in two; and one of our men that was with
me took hold of thesheepskin that covered it,and pulled
at it; when, behold, a most hideous outcry and howling
ran through the village, and two or three hundred peq-
pie came about my ears, so that I was glad to scour for
it, for we saw some had bows and arrows; but I resol-
ved from that moment to visit them again. Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which
was about four miles off, in order to provide some
horses which they wanted, several of the horses having
been lamed and jaded with the badness of the way, and
long march over the last desert; so we had some leisure
here to put my design in execution. I communicated
my design to the Scots merchant of Moscow, of whose
courage I had sufficient testimony, as above: I told
him what I had seen, and with what indignation I
had since thought that human nature could be so
degenerate; I told him, if I could get but four or
five men well armed to go with me, I was resolved
to go and destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let
them see that it had no power to help itself; and con-
sequently could not be an object of worship, or to be
prayed to, much less help them that offered sacrifices
to it. He laughed at me :—Says he, your zeal may be good,
but what do you propose to yourself by it? Propose,
said I, to vindicate the honour of God, which is in-
sulted by this devil-worship. But how will it vindi-
cate the honour of God, said he, while the people will
not be able to know what you mean by it, unless you
could speak to them, and tell them so? and then they
will fight you, and beat you too, I'll assure you; for
they are desperate fellows, and that especially in de-
fence of their idolatry. Can we not, said I, do it in
the night, and then leave them the reasons and causes
in writing in their own language? Writing! said he;
why, there is not a man in five nations of them that knows
knows any thing of a letter, or how to read a word any-
way. Wretched ignorance, said I to him: however,
I have a great mind to do it; perhaps nature may draw
inferences from it to them, to let them see how brutish
they are to worship such horrid things. Look you,
Sir, said he, if your zeal prompts you to it so warmly,
you must do it; but in the next place I would have you
consider, these wild nations of people are subjected by
force to the Czar of Muscovy's dominion, and
if you do this, it is ten to one but they will come
by thousands to the governor of Nertsinskay, and
demand satisfaction; and if he cannot give them satis-
faction, it is ten to one but they revolt; and it will
occasion a new war with all the Tartars in the country. This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for
a while; but I still found that my inclination increased
for executing the project I had been forming to de-
stroy the monster, if it were possible to do it with any
safety: and upon meeting the Scots merchant by
accident the next evening, and consulting him again,
I found he was grown as earnest for it as my-
self; so we sat down to contrive how we should effec-
tually execute our purpose: and when we had laid the
scheme to our mind, with the assistance of a trusty
companion, and a servant or two, we went out private-
ly, and came up to their priests in the night; and then,
by a stratagem, having consined them and their atten-
dants in their house or tent, we stuffed wild-fire in the
silthy idol's mouth and cars ; and with the addition of
other combustible stuff, we burned the frightful image
to assies, without being apprehended.'
After the feat was performed, we appeared in the
morning among our fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in
in getting ready for our journey; nor could any man
suggest that we had been any where but in our beds,
as travellers might be supposed to be, to fit themselves
for the fatigues of the day's journey. But the affair did not end so; the next day came a
great number of the country people to the town-gates,
and in a most outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insulting their
priests, and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu.
The people of Nertsinskay were at first in a great con-
sternation, for they said the Tartars were already no
less than thirty thousand strong. The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease
them, and gave them all the good words imaginable;
assuring them that he knew nothing of it, and that there
had not a soul in his garrison been abroad, so that it
could not be from any body there; but if they could
let him know who did it, they should be exemplarily
punished. They returned haughtily that all the coun-
try reverenced the great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who
dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared to
offer violence to his image but some Christian mis-
creant; and they therefore resolved to denounce war
against him and all the Russians, who, they said, were
miscreants and Christians. The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a
breach, or to have any cause of war alleged to be given
by him, the Czar having strictly charged them to treat
the conquered country with gentleness and civility,
gave them still all the good words he could. At last he
told them there was a caravan gone towards Russia that
morning, and perhaps it was some of them who had
done them this injury; and that if they would be satis-
3 tied
ADVENTURES OF
fied with that, he would send after them to inquire into
it. This seemed to appease them a little; and accordingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular
account how the thing was; intimating withal, that if
any in our caravan had done it, they should make their
escape; but that whether we had done it or no, we
should make all the haste forward that was possible; and
that, in the mean time, he would keep them in play as
long as he could. This was very friendly in the governor; however,
when it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew
any thing of the matter; and as for us that were
guilty, we were least of all suspected. However, the
captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that
the governor gave us, and we travelled two days and
two nights without any considerable stop, and then we
lay at a village called Plothus: nor did we make any
long stop here, but hastened on towards Jarawena, ano-
therof the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and where we
expected we should be safe. But upon the second day's
march from Plothus, by the clouds of dust behind us
at a great distance, some of our people began to be sen-
sible we were pursued. We had entered a great desert, and had passed by a great lake called Schaks Oser, when we perceived a very great body of horse appear
on the other side of the lake, to the north, we travelling
west. We observed they went away west, as we did,
but had supposed we would have taken that side of the
lake, whereas we very happily took the south side; and
in two days more they disappeared again: for they be-
lieving we were still before them, pushed on till they
came to the river Udda, a very great river when it
pasies
fiasles sarther north, but when we came to it we found
it narrow and fordable. The third day, they had either found their mistake,
or had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us
towards the dusk of the evening. We had, to our
great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our
camp, which was very convenient for the night; for as
we were upon a desert, though but at the beginning of
it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had no
towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the
city Jarawena, which we had yet two days march to;
the desert, however, had some few woods in it on this
side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great river
Udda: it was in a narrow strait, between little, but
very thick woods, that we pitched our little camp for
that night, expecting to be attacked in the night. Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pur-
sued for: but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to
go about in troops in that desert, so the caravans al-
ways fortify themselves every night against them, as
against armies of robbers; and it was therefore no new
thing to be pursued. But we had this night, of all the nights of our tra-
vels, a most advantageous camp; for we lay between
two woods, with a little rivulet running just before our
front, so that we could not be surrounded, or attacked
any way but in our front or rear. We took care also to make our front as strong as we could, by placing our
packs, with our camels and horses, all in a line, on the
inside of the river, and felling some trees in our rear. In this posture we encamped for the night; but the
enemy was upon us before we had finished our situa-
tion. They did not come on us like thieves, as we expected,
ADVENTURES OF
expected, but sent three messengers to us, to demand
the men to be delivered to them that had abused their
priests, and burned their god Cham Chi-Thaungu
with fire, that they might burn them with fire; and
upon this, they said, they would go away, and do us
no sarther harm; otherwise they would destroy us all.
Our men looked very blank at this message, and began
to stare at one another, to see who looked with the most
guilt in their faces: but nobody, was the word; nobody
did it. The leader of the caravan sent word he was
well assured that it was not done by any of our camp;
that we were peaceable merchants, travelling on our
business; that we had done no harm to them or to any
one else; and that, therefore, they must look farther for their enemies who had injured them, for we were
not the people; so desired them not to disturb us; for
if they did, we should defend ourselves. They were far from being satisfied with this for an
answer; but agreat crowd of them came running down
in the morning, by break of day, to our camp; but
seeing us in such an unaccountable situation, they durst
come no farther than the brook in our front, where
they stood, and (hewed us such a number that indeed
terrified us very much; for those that spoke least of
them spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood and
looked at us a while, and then setting up a great howl,
they let fly a cloud of arrows among us; but we were
well enough fortified for that, for we sheltered under
our baggage, and I do not remember that one of us
was hurt. Some time after this, we saw them move a little to
our right, and expected them on the rear; when a
cunning fellow, a Cossack of Jarawena, in the pay of the
the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the caravan,
said to him, I'll go send all these people away to Sihe-
ilka; this was a city four or five days journey at least to
the right, and rather behind us. So he takes his bow
and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides away
from our rear directly, as it were back to Nertsinskay;
after this, he takes a great circuit about, and comes
directly on the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell them a long story, that the peo-
ple who had burnt the Cham Chi Thaungu, were
gone to Siheilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he
called them, that is to say, Christians; and that they
had resolved to burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging to
the Tongueses. As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and per-
fectly spoke their language, he counterfeited so well,
that they all took it from him, and away they drove in a most violent hurry to Siheilka, which, it seems,
was five days journey to the north; and in less than
three hours they were entirely out of our sight, and
we never heard any more of them, nor whether they
went to Siheilka or no. So we passed safely on to Jarawena, where there was
a garrison of Muscovites, and there we rested sive days;
the caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last
day's hard march, and with want of rest in the night. From this city we had a frightful desert, which held
us twenty-three days march. We furnished ourselves
with some tents here, for the better accommodating
ourselves in the night; and the leader of the caravan
procured sixteen carriages, or waggons of the country,
for carrying our water or provisions; and these carri-
ages were our defence, every night, round our little
camp; so that had the Tartars appeared, unless they
Vol. II. X had
had been very numerous indeed, they would not have
been able to hurt us. We may well be supposed to want rest again after this long journey; for-in this desert we neither saw house
nor tree, and scarce a bush; though we saw abundance of
the sable hunters, who are all Tartars of the Mogul
Tartary, of which this country is a part; and they fre-
quently attack small caravans, but we saw no numbers
of them together. After we had passed this desert, we came into a coun-
try pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we found
towns and castles, settled by the Czar of Muscovy, with
garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans,
and defend the country against the Tartars, who
would, otherwise, make it very dangerous travelling;
and his Czarish Majesty has given such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and merchants, that,
if there are any Tartars heard of in the country, de-
tachments of the garrisons are always sent to see the
travellers safe from station to station. And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had an
opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots
merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered us a
guard of fifty men, if we thought there was any danger,
to the next station. I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe we should find the country better inhabited, and the people more civilized; but I found myself
mistaken in both ; for we had yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass through, where we saw the same tokens
of paganism and barbarity as before; only, as they were
conquered by the Muscovites, they were not so danger-
ous; but for rudeness of manners, and idolatry, no
people in the world ever went beyond them; they are
5 cloathed
eloathed all in skins of beasts, and their houses are built
of the same; you know not a man from a woman,
neither by the ruggedness of their countenances nor their
clothes; and in the winter, when the ground is covered
with snow, they live under-ground in vaults, which
have cavities going from one to another. If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a
whole village or country, these had idols in every hut
and'every cave: besides, they worship the stars, the sun, the water, the snow, and, in a word, every thing they
don't understand, and they understand but very little;
so that every element, every uncommon thing, sets them
a sacrificing. But I am no more to describe people than
countries, any sarther than my own story comes to be
concerned in them: I met with nothing peculiar to my-
self in all this country, which I reckon was, from the de-
sert I spoke of last, at least four hundred miles, half
of it being another desert,which took us up twelve
days severe travelling, without house or tree; but were
obliged again to carry our own provisions, as well water
as bread. After we were out of this desert, and had
travelled two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite
city or station on the great river Janezay, which, they
told us there, parted Europe from Asia.
And yet, here I observed ignorance and paganism
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons; all
the country between the river Oby and the river Jane-
zay is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous,
as the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as any nation, for
aught I know, in Asia or America. I also found,
which I observed to the Muscovite governors whom I
had opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans
are not much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being
under the Muscovite government, which they acknow-
X 2 ledged
lcdged was true enough; but that, as they said, was
none of their business; that if the Czar expected to
convert his Siberian, Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it
fliouldbe done by sending clergymen among them, not
soldiers; and, they added, with more sincerity than I
expected, that they found it was not so much the con-
cern of their monarch to make the people Christians as it was to make them subjects. From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a
wild uncultivated country, barren of people and good
management, otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant,
fruitful, and agreeable country. What inhabitants we
found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent among
them from Russia: for this is the country, I mean on
both sides the river Oby, whither the Muscovite cri-
minals that are not put to death are banished, and from
whence it is next to impossible they should ever come
away. I have nothing material to say of my particular af-
fairs till I came to Tobolski, the capital city of Sibe-
ria, where I continued some time on the following
occasion. We had now been almost seven months on our jour-
ney, and winter began to come on apace; whereupon
my partner and I called a council about our particular af-
saiis, in which we found it proper,as we were boundfor
England, and not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose
of ourselves. They told us of sledges and rein deer to
carry us over the snow in the winter time; and indeed
they have such things that it would be incredible to
relate the particulars of, by which means the Russians
travel more in the winter than they can in summer:
because in these sledges they are able to run night and
day; the snow being frozen, is one universal covering 3C9
to nature, by which the hill's, the vales, rivers,
the lakes, are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they
run upon the surface, without any regard to what is
underneath. But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey
of this kind; I was bound to England, not to Moscow,
and my route lay two ways; either I must go on as the
caravan went, till I came to Jaroslaw, and then go off
west for Narva, and the gulph of Finland, and so to
Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China cargo
to good advantage; or I must leave the caravan at a lit-
tle town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six days by water to Archangel, and from thence might be
sure of shipping either to England, Holland, or Ham-
burgh.
Now to go any of these journeys in the winter would
have been preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic
would have been frozen up, and I could not get passage;
and to go by land in those countries was far less safe
than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise, to go to
Archangel in October, all the ships would be gone
from thence, and even the merchants who dwell there
in summer retire south to Moscow in the winter, when
the ships are gone; so that I could have nothing but
extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of pro-
visions, and must lie in an empty town all the winter:
so that, upon the whole, I thought it much my better
way to let the caravan go, and make provision to winter
where I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the lati-
tude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three
things to wear out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of
provisions, such as the country afforded, a warm house,
with fuel enough, and excellent company; of all
which, I shall give a full account in its place, . X 3 I was^
ADVENTURES OF
I was now in a quite different climate from my be-
loved island, where I never felt cold, except when I
had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do to
bear any clothes on my back, and never made any fire
but without doors, and for my necessity indressing my
food, &c. Now I made me three good vests, with
large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to the
feet, and button close to the wrists; and all these lined
with furs, to make them sufficiently warm. As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly dis-
liked our way in England of making fires in every
room in the house in open chimneys, which, when the
fire was out, always kept the air in the room cold as the
climate; but taking an apartment in a good house in
the town, I ordered a chimney to be built like a fur-
nace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove;
the funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the
doorto come at the fire went in another, and all the
rooms were kept equally warm, but no fire seen, just
as they heat the bagnios in England. By this means,
we had always the same climate in all the rooms, and
an equal heat was preserved; and how cold soever it
was without, it was always warm within; and yet we
saw no fire, nor were ever incommoded with smoke. The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good company here, in a coun-
try so barbarous as that of the most northerly parts of
Europe, near the frozen ocean, within but a very few
degrees of Nova Zembla. But this being the country where the state criminals
of Muscovy, as I observed before, are all banished,
this city was full of noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers,
and courtiers of Muscovy. Here was the samous
Prince
3U
Pfince Gallitzen, the old general Robostiski, and
several other persons of note, and some ladies. By means of my Scots merchant, whom neverthe-
less I parted with here, I made an acquaintance with
several of these gentlemen; and from these, in the long
winter nights in which I staid here, I received several
very agreeable visits. It was talking one night with
Prince , one of the banished ministers of state belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that the discourse
of my particular case began. He had been telling me
abundance of fine things of the greatness, the magni-
ficence, the dominions, and the absolute power of the
Emperor of the Russians: I interrupted him, and told
him I was a greater and more powerful prince than
even the Czar of Muscovy was, though my dominions were notso large, or my people so many. The Russian grandee looked a little surprized, and, fixing his eyes
steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant. I told him his wonder would cease when I had ex-
plained myself. First, I told him I had absolute
disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects;
that, notwithstanding my absolute power, I had not
one person disaffected to my government, or to my
person, in all my dominions. He shook his head at
that, and said, there, indeed, I outdid the Czar of
Muscovy. I told him that all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and all my subjects were not only
my tenants, but tenants at will; that they would all
fight for me to the last drop; and that never tyrant, for
such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so universally beloved, and yet so horribly feared by his subjects. After amusing him with these riddles in government for a while, I opened the case, and told him the story
?t large of my living in the island; and how I managed X 4 both
both myself and the people that were under me, just as
I have since minuted it down. They were exceedingly
taken with the story, and especially the prince, who
told me, with a sigh, that the true greatness of life was
to be masters of ourselves; that he would not have ex-
changed such a state of life as mine to be Czar of
Muscovy; and that he found more felicity in the re-
tirement he seemed to be banished to there, than ever
he found in the highest authority he enjoyed in the
court of his master the Czar; that the height of human
wisdom was to bring our tempers down to our circum-
stances, and to make a calm within, under the weight
of the greatest storms without. When he came first
hither, he said he used to tear the hair from his head,
and the clothes from his back, as others had done be-
fore him; but a little time and consideration had made
him look into himself, as well as round him, to things
without: that he found the mind of man, if it was but
once brought to reflect upon the state of universal life,
and how little this world was concerned in its true fe-
licity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity for it-
self, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own
best ends and desires, with but very little assistance from
the world; the air to breathe in, food to sustain life,
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in order
to health, completed, in his opinion, all that the world
could do for us; and though the greatness, the autho-
rity, the riches, and the pleasures which some enjoyed
in the world, had much in them that was agreeable
to us, yet he observed, thatall those things chiefly
gratified the coarsest of our affections, such as our am-
bition, our particular pride, 'our avarice, our vanity,
pnd our sensuality; all which being the mere product of the worst part of man, were in themselves crimes, mi
and had in them the seeds of all manner of crimes; but
neither were related to, nor concerned with, any of those
virtues that constituted us wife men; or of those graces
that distinguished us as Christians; that being now de-
prived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in
the full exercise of all those vices, he said he was at
leisure to look upon the dark side of them, where he
found all manner of deformity, and was now convin-
ced that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and
great, and preserves him in the way to a superior hap-
piness in a future state ;,-and in this, he said, they were
more happy in their banishment than all their ene-
mies were, who had the full possession of all the wealth
and power they had left behind them. Nor, Sir, says he, do I bring my mind to this politically,
by the necessity of my circumstances, which some call
miserable; but, if I know any thing of myself, I would
not now go back, though the Czar my master should
call me, and reinstate me in all my former grandeur:
I say, I would no more go back to it than I believe my
soul, when it shall be delivered from this prison of
the body, and has had a taste of the glorious state be-
yond life, would come back to the gaol of flesh and
blood it is now inclosed in, and leave heaven, to deal
in the dirt and crime of human affairs. He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper,
so much earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it
was evident it was the true sense of his foul:—There
was no room to doubt his sincerity. I told him I once
thought myself a kind of monarch in my old station,
of which I had given him an account; but that I
thought he was not a monarch only, but a great
conqueror; for be that has got a victory over his own
exorbitant desires, and the absolute dominion over him-
ADVENTURES OF
himself, whose reason entirely governs his will, is cer-
tainly greater than he that conquers a city. But, my
Lord, said I, shall I take the liberty to ask you a ques-
tion? 'With all my heart, says he :—If the door of your
liberty was opened, said 1, would you. not take hold of
it to deliverjou from this exile?
Hold, said he; your question is subtile, and requires
some serious, just distinctions, to give it a sincere answer;
and I will give it you from the bottom of my heart.
Nothing that I know of in this world would move me
to deliver myself from this state of banishment, except
these two; first, the enjoyment of my relations; and,
secondly, a little warmer climate: but I protest to
you, that to go back to the pomp of the court, the
glory, the power, the hurry of a minister of state; the
wealth, the gaiety, and the pleasures of a courtier; if
my master should send me word this moment that he
restores me to all he banished me from, I protest, if I
know myself at all, I would not leave this wilderness,
these deserts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace at
Moscow,
But, my Lord, said I, perhaps you not only are banished from the pleasures of the court, and from the
power, authority, and wealth you enjoyed before,
but you may be absent too from some of the conveni-
encies of life; your estate, perhaps, confiscated, and
your effects plundered; and the supplies left you here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of
life.
Aye, says he, that is as you suppose me to be a lord,
or a prince, &c. So indeed I am; but you are now to
consider me only as a man, a human creature, not at
all distinguished from another; and so I can suffer no
want, unless I should be visited with sickness and distern-
tempers. However, to put the question out of dispute,
you see our manner; we are, in this place, five per-
sons of rank; we live perfectly retired, as suited to a
state of banishment; we have something rescued from
the shipwreck of our fortunes, which keeps us from the
mere necessity of hunting for food; but the poor sol-
diers, who are here without that help, live in as much
plenty as we, who go into the woods and catch sables
and foxes; the labour of a month will maintain them a
year; and, as the way of living is not expensive, so it
is not hard to get sufficient to ourselves. So that ob-
jection is out of doors.
I'have not room to give a full account of the most
agreeable conversation I had with this truly great man;
in all which he showed that his mind was so inspired
with a superior knowledge of things, so supported by
religion, as well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his
contempt of the world was really as much as he had
expressed, and that he was always the same to the last,
as will appear in the story I am going to tell. I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful
winter I thought it; the cold so intense that I could
not so much as look abroad without being wrapped in
furs, and a mask of fur before my face, or rather a
hood, with only a hole for breath, and two for sight:
the little day-light we had was, as we reckoned, for
three months, not above five hours a-day, and six at
most; only that the snow lying on the ground continu-
ally, and the weather clear, it was never quite dark.
Our horses were kept, or rather starved, under-ground;
and as for our servants, whom we hired three servantshere
to look after our horses and horses, we had, every now
and then, their fingers and toes to thaw and take care
of, lest they should mortify and fall off. ADVENTURES OF
It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the
glass all double: our food was chiefly the flesh of deer,
dried and cured in the season; bread good enough, but
baked as biscuits; dried fish of several sorts, and some
flesh of mutton and of the buffaloes, which is pretty
good meat. All the stores of provisions for the winter
are laid up in the summer, and well cured: our drink
was water, mixed with aqua-vitae instead of brandy;
and for a treat, mead instead of wine ; which, how-
ever, they have excellent good. The hunters, who
venture abroad all weathers, frequently brought us in
fine venison, and sometimes bear's flesh, but we did
not much care for the last. We had a good stock of
tea, with which we treated our friends as above, and
we lived ver chearfully and well, all things consi-
dered. It was now March, the days grown considerably
longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so the other
travellers began to prepare sledges to carry them over
the snow, and to get things ready to be going; but my
measures being fixed, as I have said, for Archangel,
and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no motion;
knowing very well that the ships from the south do not
set out for that part of the world till May or June, and
that if I was there by the beginning of August, it would
be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away;
and therefore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as
others did: in a word, I saw a great many people, nay,
all the travellers, go away before me. It seems, every
year they go from thence to Muscovy for trade, viz. to
carry furs, and buy necessaries with them, which they
bring back to furnish their shops: also others went on the
the same errand to Archangel; but then they all being to come back again, above eight hundred miles,
went all out before me. In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack
up; and, as I was doing this, it occurred to me that,
seeing all these people were banished by the Czar of Mus-
covy to Siberia, and yet, when they came there, were
left at liberty to go whither they would, why they did
not then go away to any part of the world, wherever
they thought fit; and I began to examine what should
hinder them from making such an attempt. But my wonder was over when I entered upon that
subject with the person I have mentioned, who answer-
ed me thus: Consider, first, Sir, said he, the place
where we are; and, secondly, the condition we are
in; especially, said he, the generality of the people
who are banished hither. We areTurrounded, said he,
with stronger things than bars or bolts; on the north
side an unnavigable ocean, where ship never sailed, and
boat never swam; every other way, we have above a
thousand miles to pass through the Czar's own domi-
nions, and by ways utterly impassable, except by the
roads made by the government, and through the towns
garrisoned by his troops; so that we could neither pass
undiscovered by the road, nor subsist any other way; so
that it is in vain to attempt it. I was silenced indeed at once, and found that they
were in a prison every jot as secure as if they had been
locked up in the castle at Moscow: however, it came
into my thoughts that I might certainly be made an
instrument to procure the escape of this excellent per-
son; and that, whatever hazard I run, I would cer-
tainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this I took
an occasion, one evening, to tell him my thoughts. I represented
represented to him that it was very easy for the f&
carry him away, there being no guard over him in the
country; and as I was not going to Moscow, but to
Archangel, and that I went in the retinue of a caravan,
by which I was not obliged to lie in the stationary
towns in the desert, but could encamp every night where
I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-
angel, where I would immediately secure him on board
an English ship, and carry him safe along with me; and
as to his subsistence, and other particulars, it should be
my care, till he could better supply himself. He heard me very attentively, andlooked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his \e-
ry sace, that what I said put his spirits into an exceed-
ing ferment; his colour frequently changed, his eyes
looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might be
even perceived in his countenance; nor could he im-
mediately answer me when I had done, and as it were
hesitated what he would say to it: but after he had pau-
sed a little, he embraced me, and said, How unhappy
are we, unguarded creatures as we are, that even our
greatest acts of friendship are made snares unto us,
and we are made tempters of one another! My dear
friend, said he, your offer is so sincere, has such kind-
ness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so calculated
for my advantage, that I must have very little know-
ledge of the world if I did not both wonder at it, and
acknowledge the obligation I have upon me to you for
it. But did you believe I was sincere in what I have
often said to you of my contempt of the world? Did
you believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I
had really obtained that degree of felicity here that had
placed me above all that the world could give me? Did you believe I was sincere when I told you I would not go back, if I was recalled even to be all that I once
was in the court, with the favour of the Czar my master?
Did you believe me, my friend, to be an honest man;
or did you believe me to be a boasting hypocrite?
Here he stopped, as if he would hear what I would say;
but indeed I soon after perceived that he stopped be-
cause his spirits were in motion, his great heart was full
of struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess,
astonished at the thing as well as at the man, and I used
some arguments with him to urge him to set himself
free; that he ought to look upon this as a door opened
by Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Pro-
vidence, who has the care and disposition of all events,
to do himself good, and to render himself useful in the
world. He had by this time recovered himself: How do you
know Sir, says he, warmly, but that instead of a sum-
mons from Heaven, it may be a feint of another instru-
ment; representing in alluring colours to me the show of felicity as a deliverance, which may in itself be
my snare, and tend directly to my ruin? Here I am free
from the temptation of returning to my former miserable greatness; there I am not sure but that all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury,which I know
remain in nature, may revive and take root, and, in a
word, again overwhelm me; and then the happy priso-
ner, whom you see now master of his soul's liberty, shall
be the miserable slave of his own senses, in the full of
all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of life, rather than pur-
chase a show of freedom at the expense of the liberty
of my reason, and at the future happiness which I now
have in my view, but shall then, I fear, quickly Joso
lose sight of; for I am but flesh; a man, a mere man;
have passions and affections as likely to possess and
overthrow me as any man: O be not my friend and
tempter both together.
If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent, looking at him, and indeed admiring
what I saw. The struggle in his soul was so great,
that though the weather was extremely cold, it put him
into a most violent sweat, and I found he wanted to
give vent to his mind; so I said a word or two, that I
would leave him to consider of it, and wait on him
again, and then I withdrew to my own apartment.
Above two hours after, I heard somebody at or near
the door of my room, and I was going to open the door,
but he had opened it, and came in. My dear friend, says
he, you had almost overset me, but I am recovered. Do
not take it ill that I do not close with your offer; I as-
sure you it is not for want of sense of the kindness of it
in you; and I came to make the most sincere acknow-
ledgment of it to you; but I hope I have got the victory
over myself.
My lord, said I, I hope you are fully satisfied that
you do not resist the call of heaven. Sir, said he, if
it had been from Heaven, the same power would have
influenced me to have accepted it: but I hope, and am
fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I declined it;
and I have insinite satissaction in the parting, that you
shall leave me an honest man still, though not a free-
man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make pro-
fessions to him of my having no end in it but a sin-
cere desire to serve him. He embraced me very passion-
ately, and assured me he was sensible of that, and should
should always acknowledge it; and with that he offered
me a very fine present of sables, too much indeed for
me to accept from a man in his circumstances, and I
would have avoided them, but he would not be refused. The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship
with a small present of tea, and two pieces of China
damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which
did not all weigh above six ounces or thereabout, but
were far short of the value of his sables, which indeed,
when I came to England, I found worth near 200I.
He accepted the tea, and one piece of the damask, and
one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon
it, of the Japan coinage, which I found he took for
the rarity of it, but would not take any more; and he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak
with me. When I came to him, he told me I knew what had
passed between us, and hoped I would not move him
any more in that affair; but that, since I had made such
a generous offer to him, he asked me if 1 had kindness
enough to offer the same to another person that he
would name to me, in whom he had a great share of
concern. I told him that I could not say I inclined
to do so much for any'but himself, for whom I had a
particular value, and should have been glad to have
been the instrument of his deliverance; however, if he
would please to name the person to me, I would give
him my answer. He told me it was his only son;
who, though I had not seen him, yet he was in the
same condition with himself, and above two hundred
miles from him, on the other side the Oby; but that,
if I consented, he would send for him. Vol. H. Y I made
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I
made some ceremony in letting him understand that it
was wholly on his account; and that seeing I could
not prevail on him, I would shew my respect to him by my concern for his son; but these things are too te-
dious to repeat here. He sent away the next day for
his son; and in about twenty days he came back with
the messenger, bringing six or seven horses loaded with
very rich furs, and which, in the whole, amounted to
a very great value. His servants brought the horses into the town, but
left the young lord at a distance, till night, when he
came incognito into our apartment, and his father
presented him to me, and, in short, we concerted the
manner of our travelling, and every thing proper for the
journey. I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black
fox skins, sine ermines, and such other furs as are very
rich; I say, I had bought them in that city, in exchange
for some of the goods I had brought from China; in
particular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold
the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards at Arch-
angel, for a much better price than I could have got at London; and my partner, who was sensible of the
profit, and whose business more particularly than mine
was merchandise, was mightily pleased with our stay,
on account of the traffic we made here. It was the beginning of June when I left this remote
place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the world; and
indeed it is so far out of the road of commerce, that I
know not how it should be much talked of. We were
now reduced to a very small caravan, having only thirty-two horses and camels in all, and all of them passed for mine,
323
mine, though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of
them: it was most natural also that I should take more
servants with me than I had before; and the young lord
passed for my steward : what'great man I passed for my-
self, 1 know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass
over that we met with in all the journey; indeed I call
it the worst, because the way was very deep in some pla-
ces, and very uneven in others; the best we had to say
for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tar-
tars or robbers to fear, and that they never came on
this side the river Oby, or at least but very seldom; but
we found it otherwise. My young lord had a saithful Siberian servant,
who was perfectly acquainted with the country, and led
us by private roads, that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities upon the great road, such as
Tumen, Soloy-Kamskoi, and several others; because
the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very
curious and strict in their observation upon travel-
lers, and searching lest any of the banished persons of
note should make their escape that way into Muscovy;
but by this means, as we were kept out of the cities, so
our whole journey was a desert, and we were obliged to
encamp and lie in our tents, when we might have had
very good accommodation in the cities on the way:
this the young lord was so sensible of, that he would
not allow us to lie abroad when we came to several ci-
ties on the way, but lay abroad himself, with his ser-
vant, in the woods, and met us always at the appointed
places. We were just entered Europe, having passed the river
Kama, which in these parts is the boundary between
Y 2 Europe.
Europe and Asia, and the first city on the European
side was called Soloy Kamskoi, which is as much as to
say, the great city on the river Kama; and here we
thought to see some evident alteration in the people; but we were mistaken; for as we had a vast desert to
pass, which is near seven hundred miles long in some
places, but not above two hundred miles over where
we passed it, so till we came past that horrible place,
we found very little difference between that country
and the Mogul Tartary, the people mostly pagans,
and little better than the savages of America; their
houses and towns full of idols, and their way of living
wholly barbarous, except in the cities, as above, and
the villages near them, where they are Christians, as
they call themselves, of the Greek church; but have
their religion mingled with so many relics of supersti-
tion, that it is scarce to be known in some places from
mere sorcery and witchcraft. In passing this forest I thought indeed we must (after
all our dangers were to our imagination escaped, as be-
fore?) have been plundered and robbed, and perhaps
murdered, by a troop of thieves; of what country they
were I am yet at a loss to know, but they were all on
horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at first
about forty-five in number; they came so near to us as
within two musket-shots, and asking no questions, surrounded us with their horses, and looked very ear-
nestly upon us twice: at length they placed themselves
just in our way; upon which we drew up in a little line, before our camels, being not above sixteen men in all;
and being drawn up thus, we halted, and sent out the
Siberian servant, who attended his lord, to see who
they were: his master was the more willing to let him go, because he was not a little apprehensive that they
were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came
up near them with a flag of truce, and called to them;
but though he spoke several of their languages, or dialects
of languages rather, he could not understand a word
they said; however, after some signs to him not to come
nearer to them, at his peril, the fellow came back no
wiser than he went; only that by their dress, he said, he
believed them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of
the Circassian hordes, and that there must be more of
them upon the great desert, though he never heard that
any of them were seen so far north before. About an hour after, they again made a motion to
attack us, and rode round our little wood to see where
they might break in; but finding us always ready to
face them, they went off again; and we resolved not
to stir from the placefor that night. This was small comfort to us; however, we had no
remedy: there was, on our left hand, at about a quarter
of a mile distance, a little grove, and very near the
road; I immediately resolved we should advance to
those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could
there; for first, I considered that the trees would in a
great measure cover us from their arrows; and, in the
next place, they could not come to charge us in a body:
it was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency attending him, that he was always readiest and most apt to direct and
encourage us in cases of the most danger. We advan-
ced immediately, with what speed we could, and gained
that little wood; the Tartars, or thieves, for we knew
not what to call them, keeping their stand, and not
attempting to hinder us. When we came thither, we 3 found,
found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy
piece of ground, and on the one side a very great
spring of water, which running out in a little brook,
was, a little farther, joined by another of the like big-
ness; and was, in short, the source of a considerable
river, called afterwards the Wirtska: the trees which
grew about this spring were not above two hundred,
but very large, and stood pretty thick, so that as soon
as we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the
enemy, unless they alighted, andattacked us on foot.
While we staid here waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving they made any mo-
vement, our Portuguese, with some help, cut several
arms of trees half off, and laid them hanging across
from one tree to another, and in a manner fenced us
in; when, about two hours before night they came
down directly upon us: and though we had not per-
ceived it, we found they had been joined by some more
of the same, so that they were near fourscore horse;
whereof, however, we fancied some were women:—
They came on till they were within half shot of our little
wood, when we fired one musket without ball, and
called to them in the Ruffian tongue, to know what
they wanted, and bade them keep off; but they came
on with a double fury up to the wood side, not imagin-
ing we were so barricaded that they could not easily
break in: our old pilot was our captain, as well as
our engineer, and desired us not to fire upon them till
they came within pistol-shot, that we might be sure
to kill; and that when we did fire, we should be sure
to take good aim: we bade him give the word of
command, which he delayed so long, that they were
some of them within two pikes length of us when we
let fly. We
327
We aimed so true that we killed fourteen of them,
and wounded several others, as also several of their
horses; for we had all of us loaded our pieces with
two or three bullets at least.
They were terribly surprised with our fire, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred rods from us,
in which time we loaded our pieces again, and seeing
them keep that distance, we sallied out, and catched
four or five of their horses, whose riders we supposed
were killed: and coming up to the dead, we judged
they were Tartars, but knew not from what country,
orhow they came to make an excursion such an unusual
length. We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most part of the night in strengthening our situation,
and barricading the entrances into the wood, and
keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight, and
when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome discovery
indeed: for the enemy, who we thought were discou-
raged with the reception they met with, were now great-
ly increased, and had set up eleven or twelve huts or
tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us; and this
little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about
three quarters of a mile from us. We were indeed
surprised at this discovery; and now, I confess, I gave
myself over for lost, and all that I had; the loss of my
effects did not lie so near me, though very considerable,
as the thoughts of falling into the hands of such barba-
rians, at the latter end of my journey, after so many
difficulties and hazards as I had gone through, and even
in sight of our port, where we expected safety and deli-
verance. As to my partner, he was raging, and declared that to lose his goods would be his ruin, and that he would
would rather die than be starved; and he was for fight-
ing to the last drop. The young lord, a gallant youth, was for fighting
to the last also ; and my old pilot was of the opinion
we were able to resist them all in the situation we
were then in; and thus we spent the day in debates of
what we should do; but tqwards evening, we found
that the number of our enemies still increased, and we
did not know but by the morning they might still be
a greater number r so I began to inquire of those peo-
ple we had brought from Tobolski, if there were no
other or moreprivate ways, by which we might avoid
them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town,
or get help to guard us over the desert. The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord, told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight,
he would engage to carry us off in the night, to a way
that went north, towards the river Petrou, by which he
made no question but we might get away, and the Tar-
tars never the wiser: but, he said, his lord had told
him he would not retreat, but would rather choose to
fight. I told him he mistook his lord; for that he
was too wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it;
that I knew his lord was brave enough, by what
he had showed already; but that his lord knew better than to desire seventeen or eighteen men to fight five
hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced them
to it; and that, if he thought it possible for us to escape
in the night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt
it. He answered, if his lordship gave him such orders he would lose his life if he did not perform it: we
soon brought his lord to give that order, though pri-
vately, vately, and we immediately prepared for the putting it
in practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled
a fire in our little camp, which we kept burning, and
prepared so as to make it burn all night, that the Tar-
tars might conclude we were still there; but as soon as
it was dark, and we could see the stars (for our guide
would not stir before), having all our horses and camels
ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who I soon
found steered himself by the north star, all the country
being level for a long way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began
to be lighter still; not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in short, it was ra-
ther lighter than we wished it to be; but by six o'clock the next morning we were got above thirty miles,
having almost spoiled our horses. Here we found a
Russian village, named Kermazinskoy. where we rested,
and heard nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day.
About two hours before night we set out again, and
travelled till eight the next morning. though not quite
so hard as before; and, about seven o'clock, we passed
a little river, called Kirtza, and came to a good large
town, inhabited by Ruffians, called Ozomoys; there
we heard that several troops or hords of Kalmucks had
been abroad wpon the desart, bur that we were now
completely out of danger of. them, which was to our
great satissaction. Here.we were obliged to get some
fresh. horses; and, having need enough of reft, we
stayed five days; and my partner and I agreed to give
the honest Siberian who brought us thither, the value
of ten pistoles for conducting us.
Vol. II. Z . In
In five days more we came to Veuslima, upon the
river Wirtzogda, and running into the Dwina; we
were there, very happily, near the end of our travels by-
land, that river being navigable, in seven days passage,
to Archangel. From hence we came to Lawrenskoy,
the third of July; and, providing ourselves with two
luggage-boats, and a barge for our own convenience,
we embarked the seventh, and arrived all safe at Arch-
angel the eighteenth; having been a year five months
and three days on the journey, including our stay of
eight months and odd days at Tobolski. We stayed
at this place six weeks, for the arrival of the ships ; and
must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburghcr come
in above a month sooner than usual.
We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August,
the same year; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage,
arrived safe in the Elbe, the 13th of September. Here
my partner and 1 found a very good sale for our goods,
as well those of China, as the sables, &c. of Siberia;
and, dividing the produce of our effects, my share
amounted to 3475I. 17s. 3d. notwithstanding so many
losses we had sustained, and charges we had been at;
only remembering, that I had included in this about
six hundred pounds worth of diamonds, which I had
purchased at Bengal
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up
the Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where
he resolved to seek protection, and could correspond with
those of his father's friends who were left alive. He
did not part, without all the testimonies he could
give me of .gratitude, for the service I had done
him, and the sense of my kindness to the prince his
father.
3 To
33i
To conclude, having stayed near four months in
Hamburgh, 1 came from thence, over-land, to the
Hague, where I embarked in the pacquet, and arrived
in London the tenth of January, 1705; having been
absent from England ten years and nine months,
And here, intending to harass myself no more, I re-
solved to prepare for a longer journey than all these,
having lived seventy-two years a life of insinite variety,
and learned sufficiently to know the value of retirement,
and the blessing of ending our days in peace.
