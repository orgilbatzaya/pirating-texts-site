THE
L I F E
AND
ADVENTURES
O F
Robinson Crusoe, &c.
Was born in the Year 1632, in
the City of York, of a good Fa-
mily, tho' not of that Country,
my Father being a Foreigner of
Bremen, who settled first at Hull:
He got a good Estate by Mer-
chandize, and leaving osf his
Trade, lived afterward at York,
from whence he had married my Mother, whose
Relations were named Robinson, a very good Fa-
ffiily in that Country, and from whom I was.called
Minfm Kreutmaer; but by the usual Corruption
of Words in England, we are now call'd, nay we
call our selves, and write our Name Crusoe, and fa
my Companions always call'd me.- - v, *
Part I. B 1 1 ad

[ 2 ]
I had two elder Brothers, one of which was
Lieutenant Colonel to an Englijb Regiment of Foot
in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Col.
Lockhart, and was killed at the Battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards: What became of my Second
Brother I never knew, any more than my Father or
Mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred
to any Trade, my Head began to be fill'd very ear-
ly with rambling Thoughts: My Father, who was
very ancient, had given me a competent Share
of Learning, as far as House-Education, and a
Country Free-School generally goes, and design'd
me for the Law; but I would be latisfied with no-
thing but going to Sea; and my Inclination to this
led me so strongly against the Will, nay the Com-
mands of my Father, and against alj.the Entreaties
and Perfwasions of my Mother and other Friends,
that there seem'd to be something fatal in that Pro-
pension of Nature tending directly to the Lise of
Misery which was to befal me.
My Father, ja wise and grave Man, gave me
serious and excellent Counsel against what he fore-
saw was my Design. He called me one Morning in-
to his Chamber, where he was confined by the
Gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon
this Subject: He ask'd me what Reasons more than
a meer wandring Inclination I had for leaving mj
father's House and my native Country, where 1
might be well introduced, and had a Prospect o
raising my Fortune by Application and Industry
with a Lise of Ease and Pleasure. He told me
it was for Men of desperate Fortunes on oni
Hand, or of aspiring, superior Fortunes on the other
who went abroad upon Adventures, to rife b;
Enterprize, and make themselves famous in Un
dertakings of a Nature out of the common Road
tha
that these things were all either too far above me*
or too far below me; that mine was the middle
State, or what might be called the upper Station
of Lw Life, which he had found by long Experience
was the best State in the World, the most suited to
human Happiness, not exposed to the Miseries and
Hardsliips, the Labour and Sufferings of the me*-
ehanick Part of Mankind, and not embarass'd with
the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and EnVy of the up-
per Part of Mankind. He told me, I might judge
of the Happiness of this State, by this one thing,
That this was the State of Lise which all
other People envied; that Kings have frequently
lamented the miserable Consequences of being born
to great Things, and wish'd they had been placed
n the middle of the two Extremes, between the
Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his
Testimony to this as the just Standard of rrue Feli-
C1ty, when he prayed to have neither Poverty or
Riches.
He bid me observe it, and I should always find,
that the Calamities of Lise were shar'd among the
"Pper and lower Part of Mankind; but that th»
middle Station had the sewest Disasters, and was
not expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or
lower Part of Mankind; nay, they were not fobjs-
fod to so many Distempers and Uneasinesses either
of Body or Mind, as those were, who by vicious
Living, Luxury and Extravagances on one Hand,
°t by hard Labour, want of Necessaries, and mean
or insufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Di-
stempers upon themselves by the natural Consequen-
ts of their Way of Living ; That the middle Sta-
tion of Lise was calculated for all Rind of Virtues,
an<l all Kind of Enjoymentschat Peace and Plen-
ty wete the Handmaids of a' middle Fortune;
tn*t Temperance. Moderation. Quietness, Health,
B » Society,
-*
[4]
Society, all agreeable Diversions, and all desirable
Pleasures, were the Blessings attending the middle
Station of Lise; that this way Men went silently
and smoothly thro' the World, and comfortably out
of it, not embarass'd with the Labours of the Hands
or of the Head, not fold to the Lise of Slavery for
daily Bread, or harrass'd with perplexed Circum-
stances, which rob the Soul ot Peace, and the Bo-
dy of Rest; not enraged with the Passion of Envy,
or secret burning Lust of Ambition for great things;
but in easy Circumstances Aiding gently thro' the
World, and sensibly tasting the Sweets of Living,
without the Bitter, seeling that they are happy,
and learning by every day's Experience to know it
more sensibly.
After this, he press'd me earnestly, and in the
most assectionate manner, not to play the young
Man, nor to precipitate my self into Miseries which
Nature and the Station of Lise I was born in,
seem'd to have provided against ; that I was under
no Necessity of seeking my Bread; that he would
do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairl)
.into the Station of Lise which he had been just re
.commending to me; and that if I was not verj
easy and happy in the World, it must be my mee
Fate or Fault that must hinder it, and that hi
should have nothing to answer for, having thus dii
charging his Duty in warning me against Measure
which he knew would be to my hurt: In a word
that as he would do very kind things for me i
I would stay and settle at Home, as he directed
so he would not have so much hand in my Misfoi
tunes, as to give me any Encouragement to g
away: And to close all, he told me, I had m
elder Brother for an Example, to whom he had use
the same earnest Perswasions to keep him from gc
ing into the Low Country Wars, but could not pr<
va
vail, his young Desires prompting him to run into
the Army, where he was killed; and tho' he said
he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would
venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolisti
Step, God would not bless me, and I would have
Leisure hereafter to reslect upon having neglected
his Counsel, when there might be none to assist in
my Recovery.
I observed in this last part of his Discourse,
which was truly Prophetick, tho' I suppose my
Father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I
oblerved the Tears run down his Face very plen-
tifully, especially when he spoke of my Brother
who was killed; and that when he spoke of my
having Leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he
was so mov'd, that he broke osf the Discourse, and
toid me, his Heart was so full, he could say no
more to. me.
. I was sincerely afsected with this Discourse, aS
indeed who could be otherwise? and I resolv'd not
to think of going Abroad any more, but to settle
at Home according to my Father's Desire. But
alas! a sew Days wore it all off; and in short, to
prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities,
in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite away
nom him. However, I did not act so hastily neither
as my first heat of Resolution prompted, but I took
my Mother at a time when I thought her a little
pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my
Thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the
World, that I should never settle to any thing with
Resolution enough to go through with it, and my
Father had better give me his Consent, than force
"|e to go without it; that I was now eighteen
lears old.which was too late to go Apprentice to
a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney, that I was sure,
* I did, I should never serve out my Time, and I
g sl;ould
should certainly run away from my Master before
myTime was out, and go to Sea; and if (he would
speak to my Father to let me go one l^oyage a-
broad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
would go no more, and I would promise by a dou-
ble Diligence to recover that Time I had lost.
This put my Mother into a gteat Passion: She
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to
speak to my Father upon any such Subject; that he
knew too well what was my Interest,to give his Con-
sent to any such thing so much for my Hurt, and that
she wondered how I could think of any such thing,
aster such a discourse as I had had with my Father,
and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my
Father had used to me; and that in short, if I would
ruin my self, there was no help for me; but I might
depend I should never have their Consent to it: That
for her part she would not have so much hand in my
Destruction; and I should never have it to say, that
my Mother was willing when my Father was not.
Tho' my Mother refused to move it to my Fa-
ther, yet, as I lave heard afterwards, she reported
all the Discourse to him, and that my Father, aftet
stiewing a great Concern at it, said to her with a
Sigh, That Boy might be happy if he would stay
dt Home, but if he goes Abroad, he will be th<
most miserablest Wretch that ever was born; I car
g-ive no Consent to it.
It was not till almost a Year after this that I broke
loose, tho' in the mean time I continued obstinate
ly deaf to all Proposals of settling to Business, anc
frequently expostulating with my Father and Mo
ttier, about their being so positively determinec
against what they knew my Inclinations prompte<
me to. But being one day at Hull, where I wen
casually, and without any purpose of making a
Elopement that time ; but I say, being there, am
on
[ 7 1
one of my Companions being going by Sea to Lon-
don in his Father's Ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common Allurement of Seafa-
ring Men, viz,. That it should cost me nothing for
my Passage, I consulted neither Father or Mother
anymore, nor so much as sent them word of it; but
leaving them to hear of it as they might, without
asking God's Blessing, or my Father's, without any
Consideration of Circumstances or Consequences,
and in an ill Hour, God knows, on the first of Sep-
tember 1651,1 went on board a Ship bound for Lon-
don: Neverany young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I
believe, began sooner, or continued longer than
mine. The Ship was no sooner gotten out of the
Humber, but the Wind began to blow, and the
Winds to rise in a most frightful manner ; and as I
had never been at Sea before, I was most inexpressi-
ble sick in Body, and terrify'd in Mind : I began,
now scriously to reslect; upon what I had done,
and how justly I was overtaken by the Judgment ot*
Heaven for my wicked leaving my Father's House,
and abandoning my Duty; all the good Counsel of
Parents, my Father's Tears, and my Mother's
Entreaties came now fresh into my Mind, and my
Conscience, which was not yet Come to the Pitch
of Hardness to which it has been since, reproach'd
me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach
of my Duty to God and, my Father.
All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea,
*hich I had never been upon before, went very high,
though nothing like what I have seen many times
™ce; no, nor like what I saw a sew Days after:
But it was enough to assect me then, who was but
'a young Sailor, and had never known any thing ot
the matter. I expected every Wave would have
swallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell
down, as I thought, in the Trough or Hollos
B 4
[8]
of the Sea, we should never rise more; and in this
Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolu-
tions, that if it would please God here to spare
my Lise in this one Voyage, if ever I got once my
Foo: upon dry Land again, I would go directly
home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship a-
gain while I lived ; that I would take his Advice,
and never run my self into such Miseries as these
any more. Now I saw plainly the Goodness of
his Observations about the middle Station of Lise,
how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his
Days, and never had been exposed to Tempests
at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I resolved that
I would, like a true repenting Prodigal, go home
to my Father.
These wise and sober Thoughts continued all the
while the Storm continued, and indeed some time
after; but the next Day the Wind was abated and
the Sea calmer, and I began to be a little inur'd
to it: However, I was very grave for all that Day,
being also a little Sea-sick stiil; but towards Night
the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite over,
and a charming fine Evening foliow'd; the Sun
went down persectly clear, and rose so the next
Morning; and having little or no Wind, and a
smooth Sea, the Sun shining upon it, the Sight was,
as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the Night, and was now no
more Sea-sick, but very chearful, looking with
Wonder upon the Sea that was so rough and terri-
ble the Day before, and could be so calm and so
pleasant in so l'ttle time after. And now lest my
good Resolutions should continue, my Companion,
who had indeed enticed me away, comes to me,
Wei! Bob, fays he, clapping me upon the Shoulder,
How do you do after it? I warrant, you were frighted,
via tit you, last Night, when it blew but a Cap full of
7. Wind?
C ? 3
Wind? A Cap full d'you call it? said I, torn a tent-
He Storm: A Storm, you Fool you, replies he, do you
call that a Storm ; vihy it vias nothing at all; give us
toa good Shif, and Sea-room, and vie think nothing of
such a Squaul of Wind as that; but you're but a frefit
Water Sailor, Bob; come, let us make a Bowl of Punch,
aid we'll forget all that ; d'ye see what charming Wea-
ther 'tis now? To make ftiort this fad Part of my
Story, we went the way of all Sailors, the Pi.nch
was made, and I was made drunk with it, and in,
that one Night's Wickedness I drown'd all my Re-
pentance, all my Reslections upon my past Con-
duct, and all my Resolutions for the future. In a
word, as the Sea was return'd to its smoothness of
Surface and settled Calmness by the abatement of
that Storm, so the Hurry of my Thoughts being
over, my Fears and Apprehensions of being swal-
low'd up by Sea being forgotten, and the Current
of my former Desires return'd, I entirely forgot the
Vows and Promises that I made in my Distress, t
found indeed some Intervals of Reslection, and the
serious Thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to re-
turn again some time, but I stiook them off, and
touz'd my self from them as it were from a Di-
stemper, and applying my self to Drinking and
Company, soon master'd the Return of those Fits,
(for so I call'd them) and I had in five or six Days
Sot as complcat a Victory over Conscience as any
young Fellow that resolv'd not to be troubled with
|t, could desire: But I was to have another Trial
w it fifll; and Providence, as in such Cases gene-
tally it does, resolv'd to leave me entirely without
e«we. For if I would not take this fora Delive-
ran«, the next was to be such a one as the worst
j™ m0ft harden'd Wretch among us would consess
«oth the Danger and the Mercy. ^
The sixth Day of our being at Sea we came in-
to Yarmouth Roads; the Wind having been contra-
ry, and the Weather calm, we had made bat little
Way since the Storm. Here we were oblig'd to
come to Anchor, and here we lay, the Wind con-
tinuing contrary, viz,, at South-West, for seven or
eight Days, during which time a great many Ships
from Newcastle came into the fame Roads, as the
common Harbour where the Ships might wait for
a Wind for the River.
We had not however rid here so long, but should
have Tided it up the River, but that the Wind
blew too fresh; and after we had lain sour or five
Days, blew very hard. However, the Roads be-
ing reckoned as good as a Harbour, the Anchorage
good, and our Ground-Tackle very strong, oui
Men were unconcerned, and not in the least appre-
hensive of Danger, but spent the Time in Rest and
Mirth, after the manner of the Sea; but the eighth
Day in the Morning, the Wind increased, and we
had all Hands at work to strike our Top-Masts
and make every thing snug and close, that the Shir
might ride as easy as possible. By Noon the Sea
went very high indeed, and our Ship rid Forecastl
in, shipp'd several Seas, and we thought once o:
twice our Anchor had come Home ; upon whicl
our Master order'd out the Sheet-Anchor; so tha
we rode with two Anchors a head, and the Cable
rered out to the better End.
By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed
and now I began to see Terror and Amazement i
the Faces even of the Seamen themselves. The Mi
ster, tho.' vigilant in the Business of preserving th
Ship, yet as he went in and out of his Cabin b
me, I could hear him softly to himself say sever
times, Lord be merciful to m, we stall be all lost, i
stall be aS undone; and the like. During these fii
Hurri<
c ii i
ies.I was stupid,lying still in myCabin, which
was in the Steerage, and cannot describe my
Temper: I could ill resume the first Penitence
which I had so apparently trampled upon, and har-
dens my self against: 1 thought the Bitterness of
Death had been past, and that this would be no-
thing too, like the first. But when the Master him-
sels came by me, as I said just now, and said we
should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted: I got
»P out of my Cabin, and look'd out; but such a
dismal Sight I never saw: The Sea went Mountains
high, and broke upon us every three or four Mi-
nutes: When I could look about, I could see no-
thing but Distress round us: Two Ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their Masts by the
Board, being deep loaden ; and our Men cry'd out,
*at a Ship which rid about a Mile a-head of us
was foundered. Two more Ships being driven
from their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to
Sea, at all Adventures, and that not with a Mast
fending. The light Ships fared the best, as not
w much labouring in the Sea; but two or three of
them drove, and came close by us, running away
with only their Sprit-fail out before the Wind.
Towards Evening the Mate and Boatswain
kgg'd the Master of our Ship to let them cut a-
way the Fore-mast, which he was very unwilling
to: But the Boatswain protesting to him, that if he
™d not, the Ship would sounder, he consented;
and when they had cut away the Fore-mast, the
Mam-mast stood so loose, and shook the Ship so
ouch, they were obliged to cut her away also,
mi make a clear Deck.
. Any one may judge what a Condition I must be
** all this, who was but a young Sailor, and
wno had been in such a Fright before at but a he
«. But if 1 can express at this distance the
r Thoughts
Thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in
tenfold more Horror of Mind upon account of my
former Convictions,, and the having returned frpm
them to the Resolutions I had wickedly takenat first,
than I was at Death itself; and these, added to the
Terror of the Storm, put me in such a Condition,
that I can by no Words describe it. But the wotst
was not come yet; the Storm continued with such
Fury, that the Seamen themselves acknowledged
they had never known a worse. We had a good Ship,
but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea,
that the Seamen every now and then cried out,, she
would founder. It was my advantage in one respect,
that I did not know what they meant by founder,
till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was so vio-
lent, that I saw what is not often seen, the Master,
the Boatswain, and some others more sensible than
the rest, at their Prayers, and expecting every mo-
ment when the Ship would go to the Bottom. In
the middle of the Night, and under all the rest of
our Distresses, one of the Men that had been down
on purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a Leak;
another said, there was four Foot Water in the
Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died
within me, and I sell backwards upon the side of
my Bed where L fat, into the Cabin. However,
the Men rouzed me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to
pump as another; at which I stirr'd up, and went
to the Pump, and work'd very heartily. While this
was doing, the Master seeing some light Colliers,
who, not able to ride out the Storm, were oblig'd
to slip and run away to Sea, and would come near
us, order'd to sire a Gun as a Signal of Distress. I
who knew nothing what that meant, was so surpri-
zed, that I thought the Ship had broke, or some
dread-
dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so sur-
prized, that I sell down in a Swoon. As this was
a time when every body had his own Lite to think
of, no body minded me, or what was become of
me; but another Man stept up to the Pump, and
thrusting me aside with his Foot, let me lie, think-
ing I had been dead ; and it was a great while
before I came to my self.
We work'd on, but the Water encreasing in the
Hold, it was apparent that the Ship would foun-
der, and tho' the Storm began to abate a little,
yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might
run into a Port, so the Master continued firing Guns
for Help s and a light Ship who had rid it out just
a-head of us, ventured a Boat out to help us. , It
was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near
us, but it was impossible for us to get ori Board,
or for the Boat to lie near the Ship side, till at last
the Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
Lives to save ours, our Men cast them a Rope over;
the Stern with a Buoy to it, 'and then vered it out
a great Length, which they after great Labour and
Hazard took hold of, and we haul'd them close
under our Stern, and got all into their Boat. It was
to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the
Boat, to think of reaching to their own Ship, so all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in to-
wards Shore as much as we could, and our Master
promised them, That if the Boat was stav'd upon
Shore, he would make it good to their Master; so
partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat went
away to the Northward, sloaping towards the
Shore almost as far as Wintenon-Ness.
We were not much more than a Quarter of art
Hour out of our Ship, but we saw her sink, and
|hen I unsierst'ood for the first time what was meant
a Ship foundering in the Sea; I must acknow-
ledge I had hardly Eyes to look up when the Sea-
men told me she was sinking; for from that Mo-
ment they rather put me into the Boat than that ]
might be said to go in, my Heart was as it were
dead within me, partly with Fright, partly with
Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what was yet
before me. .
While we were in this Condition, the Men yet
labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat near the
Shore, we could see, (when our Boat mounting the
Waves, we were able to see the Shore,) a great
many People running along the Strand to assist us
when we should come near; but we made but slow
Way towards the Shore, nor were we able to reach
the Shore, till being past the Light-house at Win-
tenon, the Shore falls off to the Westward towards
Cromer, and so the Land broke off a little the Vio-
lence of the Wind: Here we got in, and tho' not
without much Difficulty, got all fase on Shore, and
walk'd afterwards on Foot to Yarmouth, where, as
unfortunate Men, we were used with great Hu-
manity, as well by the Magistrates of the Town,
who affign'd us good Quarters, as by particular
Merchants and Ownets of Ships, and had Money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or
back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the Sense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone Home, I had been happy, and
my Father, an Emblem of our blessed Saviour's Pa-
rable, had even kill'd the fatted Calf for me; foi
hearing the Ship I went away in, was cast away in
Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he had
any Assurance that I was not drown'd.
But my ill Fate pusiVd me on now with an Ob-
stinacy that nothing could resist; and tho' I had se-
veral times loud Calls from my Reason and my
more composed Judgment to go home, yet I had
n«
[nO
to Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor
will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling Decree
that hurries us on to be the Instruments of our own
Destruction, even tho' it be before us, and that we
push upon it with our Eyes open. Certainly, no-
thing but some such decreed unavoidable Misery
attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have push'd me forward against the
calm Reasonings and Perswafions of my most re-
tired Thoughts, and against two such visible In-
structions as I had met with in my first Attempt.
My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me be-
fore, and who was the Master's Son, was now less
forward than I ; the first time he spoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were separated in the Town to
several Quarters; I fay, the first time he saw me,
it appear d his Tone was alter'd, and looking very
melancholy, and shaking his Head, ask'd me how
I did, and telling his Father who. I was, and how
Uadcome this Voyage only for aTryal, inorder
to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me
with a very grave and concerned Tone; YoungMan,
fays he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought
'«take this for a flain and visible Token, that you art
KM to he a Seafaring Man. Why, Sir, said I, will you
go to Sea no more? That is another Cafe, said he,
* " my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you made
this Voyage for aTryal, you see what a Taste Heaven has
i'Wnyou of -what you are to expett if you persist ;perhaps
*i" '* "A befallen us on your Account, like Jonah in the
Sh'P of Tarshish. Pray, continues he, what are you?
and to vikat Account did you go to Sea? Upon that' I
told him some of my Story; ar the End os which he
burst out with a strange kind of Passion, What had I
done, says he, that such an unhappy Wretch should
tome into my Ship ! I would not set my Foot in
the same Ship with thee again for a Thousand
Pounds. This indeed was, as I said, an Excursion
of his Spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense
of his Loss, and was farther than he could have
Authority to go. However, he afterwards talk'd
very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my
Father, and not tempt Providence to my Ruin;
told me I might see a visible Hand of Heaven a-
gainst me ; And young Man, said he, depend upon it,
if you do not go hack, where ever you go, you will meet
with nothing but Disasters and Disappointments, till your
Father's Words are fulfilled upon you.
We parted soon after; for I made him little An-
swer, and I saw him no more; which way he went
I know not. As for me, having some Money in
my Pocket, I travelled to London by Land; and
there, as well as on the Road, had many Struggles
with my self, what Course of Lise I should take,
and whether I mould go Home, or go to Sea.
As to going Home, Shame opposed the best
Motions that osser'd to my Thoughts ; and it im-
mediately occur'd to me how I mould be laugh'd
at among the Neighbours, and mould be asham'd
to see, not my Father and Mother only, but even
every Body else: From whence I have since often
observ'd how incongruous and irrational the com-
mon Temper of Mankind is, especially of Youth,
to that Reason which ought to guide them in such
Cases, viz,. That they are not ashamed to sin, and
yet are asham'd to repent; nor asham'd of the Acti-
on for which they ought ;ustly to be esteem'd Fools,
but are ashamed of the returning, which only can
make them be esteem'd wise Men.
In this State of Lise however I remain'd some
time, uncertain what Measures to take, and what
Course of Lise to lead. An irresistible Reluctance
continued to going Home; and as I stay'd a while,
[>7]
the Remembrance of the-Distress I had been in
wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion 11
had in my Desires, to a Return, wore off with ir,:
till at last I quite laid alide the Thoughts of it, and
look'dout fora Voyage. - f.
That evil Influence which carried me first away
from my Father's House, that hurried me into the
wild and indigested Notion of raising my Fortune,
and that impress'd those Conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good Advice, and
to the Entreaties, and even the Command of my
Father; I fay, the fame Insluence, whatever it was,
presented the most unfortunate of all Enterprizes
to my View; and I went on board a Vessel bound
to the Coast of Africa, or, as our Sailors vulgarly
call it, a Voyage to Guiney.
It was my great Misfortune, that in all these.
Adventures I did not ship my self as a Sailor;
whereby, tho' I might indeed have work'd-a little-
harder than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had
Wd'the Duty and Osfice of a Foremast Man ;.
Jnd in time might have qualisied my self for a
Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a Master. But as
* was always my Fate to chuse for the worse, so .
I did here ; for having Money in my Pocket, and
lood Cloaths upon my Back, I would always go
on board in the Habit of a Gentleman; and so I
"either had any Business in the Ship, or learn'd to
Jit was my Lot first of all to fall into pretty good-
t-ompany in London, which does not always hap-
P*11 to such loose and unguided young Fellows as I
TO was; the Devil generally not omitting to lay
tome Snare for them very early: But it was not so
*'th me; I first sen acquainted with the Master of
» Ship who had been on the Coast of Guiney ; a"d
who having had very good Success there, was re-
Part L C - *°lved
solved to go again; and who taking a Fancy to my
Conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at
that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the
World, told me, if I would go the Voyage with
him, I should be at no Expence; I should be his
Mess-Mate and his Companion, and if I could car-
ry any thing with me, I should have all the Ad-
vantage of it that the Trade would admit; and per-
haps I might meet with some Encouragement.
I embrac'd the Ofser, and entring into a strict
Friendship with this Captain, who was an honest
and plain-dealing Man, I went the Voyage with
him, and carried a small Adventure with me, which
by the disinterested Honesty of my Friend the Cap-
tain, I encreased very considerably; for I carried
about 40 /. in such Toys and Trisles as the Cap-
tain directed me to buy. This 40 /. I had muster'd
together by the Assistance of some of my Relations
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe,
got my Father, or at least my Mother, to contri-
bute so much as that to my first Adventure.
This was the only Voyage which I may fay was
successful in all my Adventures, and which I owe
to the Integrity and Honesty of my Friend the
Captain, under whom also I got a competent
Knowledge of the Mathematicks and the Rules of
Navigation, learn'd how to keep an account of the
Ship's Course, take an Observation, and, in short,
to understand some things that were needful to be
understood by a Sailor: For, as he took delight to
introduce me, I took delight to learn; and, in at
Word, this Voyage made me both a Sailor and a
Merchant: For I brought home y Pound 9 Ounce*
of Gold-Dust for my Adventure, which yielded me
in London it my Return, almost 300/. and this filled
me with those aspiring Thoughts which have since
so compleated my Ruin.
Yet
Yet even in this Voyage 1 had my Misfortunes
too; particularly that I was continually sick, be-
ing thrown into a violent Calenture by the excessive
Heat of the Climate; our principal Trading being
upon the Coasts from the Latitude of 15 Degrees
North, even to the Line itself.
I was now set up lor a Guinej Trader ; and my
Friend, to my great Misfortune, dying soon after
his Arrival, I resolved to go the same Voyage
again, and 1 embark'd in the same Vessel with one
who was his Mate in the former Voyage, and had
now got the Command of the Ship. This was the
unhappiest Voyage that ever Man made; for tho'
I did not carry quite 100 / of my new gain'd
Wealth, so that 1 had 200 /. left, and which I
lodg'd with my Friend's Widow, who was very
just to me, yet I sell into terrible Misfortunes in
this Voyage; and the first was this, viz,. Our Ship
making her Course towards the Canary Islands, or
rather between those Islands and the African Shore,
was surprized in the Gray of the Morning by a
Turldjb Rover of SaEee, who gave chace to us with
a" the Sail she could make. We crowded also as
much Canvass as our Yards would spread, or our
Masts carry, to have got clear; but finding the Pi-
rate gain'd upon us, and would certainly come up
with us in a sew Hours, we prepared to fight; our
Ship having 11 Guns, and the Rogue 18. About
three in the Afternoon he came up with us, and
bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our Quarter,
instead of athwart our Stern, as he intended, we
nought 8 of our Guns to bear on that side, and
P°ut'd in a Broadside upon him, which made him
sheet off again, after rerurning our Fi>e, and pour-
ing in also his small Shot from near 200 Men which
he had on Board. However, we hrii not a Man
touch'd, all our Men keeping dose. He prepaid
C 2 to
to attack us again, and we to desend our selves;
but laying us on Board the next time upon our
other Quarter, he entered <5o Men upon our Decks,
who immediately sell to cutting and hacking the
Decks and Rigging. We ply'd them with Small-
shot, Half-Pikes, Powder-Chests, and such like*
and clear'd our Deck of them twice. However,
to cut short this melancholy part of our Story, our
Ship being disabled, and three of our Men kill'd,
and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and'
were carry'd all Prisoners into Saliee, a Port be-
longing to the Moors.
The Usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended, nor was I carried up the Coun-
try to the Emperor's Court, as the rest of our Men
were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover,
as his proper Prize, and made his Slave, being
young and nimble, and sit for his Business. At this
surprizing Change of my Circumstances, from a
Merchant to a miserable Slave, I was persectly o-
verwhelmed; and now I look'd back upon my
Father's prophetick Discourse to me, that I should
be miserable, and hav e none to relieve me, which
I thought was now so essectually brought to pass,
that I could not be worse; that now the Hand of
Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone
without Redemption. But alas! this was but a
Taste of the Misery I was to go thro', as will ap-
pear in the Sequel of this Story.
As my new Patron,or Master,had taken me home
to his House, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to Sea again, believing
that it would some time or other be his Fate to
be taken by a Spanijh or Portugal Man of War;
and that then I should be set at Liberty. But this
Hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he
went to Sea, he left me on Shore to look aseer his
little Garden, and do the common Drudgery pf
Slaves about his House; and when he came home
again from his Cruise, he ordered me to lie in the
Cabin, to look after the Ship. ;.
Here I meditated nothing but, my Escape, and
what Method I might take to essect it; but found
noway that had the least. Probability in it: No-
thing presented to make the Supposition of it ratio-
nal; for I had no body to communicate it to, that,
would embark with me, no Fellow Slave, no Eng-
lijhman, Irijhman, or Scotsman there but my self;
so that for two Tears, tho' I often pleased my self
with the Imagination, yet I never had the least en-
couraging Prospect of putting it in Practice. i
After about two Years, an odd Circumstance pre-
sented it self, which put the old Thought of making
some attempt for my Liberty again in my Head:
¥y Patron lying at home longer than usual, with-
out fitting out his Ship, which, as I heard, was for
Want of Money, he used constantly once or twice
4 Week, sometimes oftner, if the Weather was fair,
jP take the Ship's Pinnace, .and go out into the
Road a fishing; and as he always took me and a
young Maresco with him to row the Boat, we made
him very merry, and I prov'd very dexterous in
catching Fish; insomuch, that sometimes he would
send me with a Moor, one of his Kinsmen, and the
iputh the Maresco, as they called him, to catch a
»f of Fish for him.
It happened one time, that going a fishing in a
"ark calm Morning, a Fog arose so thick, that tho*
*e were not nalf a League from tne Shore, we lost.
!)gsit of it; and rowing we knew not whither oe
which way, we labour'd all Day, and all the next
N'ght ; and when the Morning came, we found we
«ad pull'd off to Sea, instead of pulling in for the
Store; and that we were at least two Leagues from
C? the
the Shore: However, we got well in again, tho'
with a great deal of Labour, and some Danger;
for the Wind began to blow pretty fresh in the
Morning; but particularly we were all very hungry.
But our Patron, warn'd by this Disaster, resolved
to take more Care of himself for the future; and
having lying by him the Long-Boat of our Enghjh
Ship we had taken, he resolved he would not go a
fishing any more without a Compass and some
Provision; so he order'd the Carpenter of his Ship,
who also was an Englijh Slave, to build a little
State-room or Cabin in the middle of the Long-
Boat, like that of a Barge, with a Place to stand
behind it to steer and haul home the Main-sheet;
and room before for a hand or two to stand and
work the Sails. She sail'd with that we call a
Shoulder of Mutton Sail; and the Boom gibb'd
over the top of the Cabin, which lay very snug
and low, and had in it, room for him to lie, with
a Slave or two, and a Table to eat on, with some
small Lockers to put in some Bottles of such Liquor
as he thought fit to drink; particularly his Bread,
Rice and Coffee.
We were frequently out with this Boat a fishing;
and as I was most dextrous to catch Fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened that he
had appointed to go out in this Boat, either for
Pleasure or for Fish, with two or three Mosrt of
some Distinction in that Place, and for whom he
had provided extraordinary; and had therefore
sent on Board the Boat over Night, a larger store
of Provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me
to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shot,
which were on Board his Ship; for that they de-
sign'd some sport of Fowling as well as Fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and
waited the next Morning with the Boat washed
dean,
dean, her Antient and Pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his Guests; when by and by
my Patron came on board alone, and told me his
Guests had put osf going, upon some Business that
fell out, and order'd me with the Man and Boy,
as usual, to go out with the Boat and catch them
some Fish, for that his Friends were to sup at his
House; and commanded, that as soon as I got
some Fish, I should bring it home to his House:
all which I prepared to do.
This Moment my former Notions of Delive-
rance darted into my Thoughts; for now I found
I was like to have a little Ship at my Command;
and my Master being gone, I prepar'd to furnish
myself, not for Fishing business, but for a Voyage;
tho' I knew not, neither did I so much as consider;
whither I should steer; for any where to get out
of that place was my way.
My first Contrivance was to make a Pretence to
•peak to this Moor, to get something for our Sub-
sistence on board; for I told him we must not pre-
sume to eat of our Patron's Bread; he said, that
w« true; so he brought a large Basket of Rusk,
orBisket, of their kind, and three Jarrs with fresh
water inso the Boat: I knew where my Patron's
Cafe of Bottles stood, which it was evident by the
Make, were taken out of some Englijh Prize ; and
I convey'd them into the Boat while the Moor was
on Shore, as if they had been there before, for out
Master: I convey'd also a great Lump of Bees-
Wax into the Boat, which weigh'd above half a
Hundred Weight, with a parcel of Twine or
Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw, and a Hammer, all
which were of great use to us afterwards; espe-
cially the Wax to make Candles. Another Trick
I try'd upon him, which he innocently came into
wo; His Name was Ifmael, whom they call Muly,
C 4 0f
L H ]
or Moky; so I call'd to him, Moley, said I, our Pa-
tron's' Guns are on Board the Boat, can you not
get a little Powder and Shot, it may be we may
kill some Ahamies (a Fowl like our Culieus) for our
selves, for I know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in
the Ship? Yes, fays 'be, I'll bring some, and accor-
dingly he brought a great Leather Pouch, which
held about a Pound and a half of Powder, or ra-
ther more; and another with Shot, that had five
or fix Pound, with some Bullets, and put all into
the Boat: At the fame time I 1iad found some
Powder of my Master's in the great Cabin, with
which'I fill'd one of the large Bottles in the Case,
.which was almost empty; pouring what was in it
into another: And shus furnished with every thing
needfal, we sail'd out of the Port to fish. The Ca-
stle which is at the Entrance of the Port, knew who
we were, and rook-no Notice of us; and we were
not above a Mile out of the Port, before we haul'd
m our Sail, and set us down to fish. The Wind
Blew from the N. N. E. which was contrary to my
TDesire ; for had it blown Southerly, I had been sure
to have made the Coast of Spain, and at least reach'd
to the Bay of Cadiz,; but my Resolutions were, blow
Which way it would, I would be gone from that hor-
rid Place where I was, and leave the rest to Fate.
After we had fish'd some time, and catch'd no-
thing, for when I had Fish on my Hook I would
not pull them up, that he might not see them ; I
said to the Moor, this will not do, our Master will
hot be rhus scrv'd, we must stand farther off: He
thinking no harm, agreed; and being in the Head
of the Boat, set the Sails; and as I had the Helm,
I run the Boat out near a League farther, and then
brought her to, as if I would fish; when giving
the Boy the Helm, I slept forward to where the
'Moor was, and making as if I stoop'd for some-
'" thing
thing behind him, I took him by Surprize with my
Arm under his Twist, and toss'd him clear over-
board into the Sea; he rose immediately, for he
swam like a Cork, and call'd to me, begg'd to be
taken in, told me he would go all over the World:
with me: he swam so strong after the Boat, that
he would have reach'd me very quickly, there be-
ing but little Wind; upon which I step'd into the
Cabin, and setching one of the Fowling-Pieces, I
presented it at him, and told him, I had done him
no Hurt, and if he would be quiet, I would do him
none: But said I, you swim well enough to reach
the Shore, and the Sea is, calm, make the best of
your Way to Shore, a.nd I will do you no Harm;
but if you come near the Boat, I'll shoot you thro',
the Head; for I am resolv'd to have my Liberty:
So he turn'd himself about and swam for the Shore,,
and I make no doubt but he reach'd it with Ease,
for he was an excellent Swimmer.
} could have been contentto have taken this Moor
^'th me, and have drown'd the Boy, but there was
"oventuring to trust him: When he was gone, I
ton'd to the Boy, who they call'd Xury, and said
to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I'll
"pake you a great Man; but if you will not stroke
your Face to be true to me, that is, smear by Ma-
homet and his father s Beard, I must throw you in-
to the Sea too; the Boy smil'd in my Face, and
'Poke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him;
and fwore t0 De faithful t0 me and g0 all over the
World with me.
. While I was in View, of the Moor that was swirrt-
lng. I stood out directly to Sea, with the Boat,
rather stretching to Windward, that they might
think me gone towards the Straits-month (as indeed
anyone that had been in theirWits must ha' been sup-
R» d to do;)for who would ha' suppos'd we were
'- -' fail a
sail'd on to the Southward, to the truly Barbarian
Coast, where whole Nations of Negroes were sure
to surround us with their Canoes, and destroy us;
where we could ne'er once go on Shore, but we
should be devour'd by savage Beasts, or more mer-
ciless Savages of Human Kind.
But as soon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I
chang'd my Course, ;and steer'd directly South and
by East, bending my Course a little toward the
East, that I might keep in with the Shore; and ha-
ving a fair fresh Gale of Wind, and a smooth quiet
Sea, I made such Sail, that I believe by the next
Day at three a-Clock in the Afternoon, when I
first made the Land, I could not be less than 150
miles South of Sallet ; quite beyond the Emperor
of Morotco's Dominions, or indeed of any other
King thereabouts, for we saw no People.
Yet such was the Flight I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful Apprehensions I had of falling in-
to their Hands, that I would not stop, or go on
Shore, or come to an Anchor; the Wind continu-
ing fair, till I had sail'd in that manner five Days:
And then the Wind shifting to the Southward, I
concloded also that if any of our Vessels were in
Chase of me, they also would now give over; so
I ventur'd to make to the Coast, and came to an
Anchor a the Mouth of a little River, I knew not
what, or where 5 neither what Laritude, what
Country, what Nation, or what River: I neither
saw, ordeuVd t«see a«y People, the principal thing
I wanted was fresh Water. We came into this
Creek in the Everting, resolving to swim on Shore
as soon as it was dark, and discover the Country;
but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such
dreadful Noises of tb§ Barking, Roaring, and
Howling of wild Creatures, of we knew not what
Kinds, that the poor Boy was ready to die with
Feat, and begg'd of me to go on Shore till Day.
Well, Xury, said I, then I won't, but it may be
we may see Men by Day, who will be as bad to
us as those Lions; then toe may give them the jhoat Gun,
fays Xury, laughing, make them run vxj; such Englijh
Tbtr) spoke by conversing among us Slaves. How-
ever, 1 was giad to see the Boy so cheerful, and I
gave him a Dram (out of our Patron's Case of Bot-
tles) to chear him up: After all, Xury's Advice
was good, and I took it, we dropp'd our little An-
chor, and lay still all Night; I fay still, for we slept
none; sot in two or three Hours we saw vast great
Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of ma-
ny sorts, came down to the Sea-shore, and run in-
to the Water, wallowing and washing themselves
for the Pleasure of cooling themselves; and they
made such hideous Howlings and Yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was
1 too: but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of the mighty Creatures come swim-
ming towards our Boat: We could not see him, but
we might hear him by his blowing, to be a mon-
strous huge and furious Beast; Xury said it was a
Lion, and it might be so for ought I know ; but
Poor Xury cried to me to weigh the Anchor and
»w away; no fays I, Xury, we can slip our Cable
with a Buoy to it, and go to Sea, they cannot
follow us far; I had no sooner said so, but I per-
jav d the Creature (whatever it was) within two
0«s length, which something surprized me; how-
ever, I immediately ftept to the Cabin-door, and
F^ing up my Gun, fir'd at him, upon which he
""mediately turn'd about, and swam towards rhe
wore again.
But it was impomble to describe the horrible
Noises, and hideousCriss and Howlings, J£|
er within the Country, upon the Noise or Re-
port of a Gun, a thing I,have some reason to
believe those Creatures had never heard before.
This convinced me that there was no going on
Shore for u,s in the Night upon that Coast, and
bow to venture on Shore in the Day, was another
of any of the Savages, had been as bad as to have
fallen into the hands of Lions and.Tygers; at
least we were equally apprehensive of the Danger
of it. . . .
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
Shore somewhere or other for Water, for we had
jiot a Pint left in the Boat: when or where to get
to it was the Point: Xury said, if I would let him
go on Shore with one of the Jarrs, he would find if
there was any Water, and bring some to me. I
ask'd him why he would go? why I should not go,
and he stay in the Boat? The Boy answer'd with
so much Asfection, that made me love him ever
after. Says he, If -wild Mans come, they eat me, you
go wey. Well, Xury, said I, we will both go, and
if the wild Mans come, we will kill them, they
shall eat neither of us; sol gave Xury a Piece of
Rusk-bread to eat, and a Dram out of pur Pa-,
iron's Case of Bottles, which I mentioned before,
and we haul'd the Boat in as near the Shore as we
thought was proper, and waded on Shore; car-
rying nothing but our Arms, and two Jarrs' for
Water.
.I did not care to go out of sight of the Boat,
searing the coming of Canoes with Savages
down the River: But the Boy seeing a low Place,
about a Mile up the Country, rambled to it, and
by and by I saw him come running towards me;
I thought he was pursued by some Savage, or

frighted
frighted with some Wild Beast, and I run forward
towards him, to help him; but when I came nearer
to him, I saw something hanging over his Shoul-
ders, which was a Creature that he had shot, like
a Hare, but different in Colour, and longer Legs;
however, we were very glad of it, and it was very
good Meat; but the great Joy that poor Xurj
came with, was to tell me he had found good
Water, and seen no wild Mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
such Pains for Water, for a little higher up the
Creek where we were, we found the Water freih
when the Tide was out, which slows but a little
way up; so we filled our Jarrs and seasted on the
Hare we had killed, and prepared to go on out
Way, having seen no Foot-steps of any human
Creature in that part of the Country.
As I had been one Voyage to this Coast before,'
I knew very well that the Islands of the Canaries}
and the Cafe de Verd Islands also, lay not far off
from the Coast. But as I had no Instruments to
take an Observation to know what Latitude we
were in, and not exactly know, or at least to re-
member, what Latitude they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or when to stand off ta
Sea towards them, otherwise I might now easily
have found some of these Islands. But my Hope
was, that if I stood along this Coast till I came to
that part where the Englijb traded, I should find
some of their Vessels upon their usual Design of
Trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my Calculation, that Place where
I now was, must be that Country, which lying be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions and the
%-om, lies waste and uninhabited, except by Wild
Beasts; the Negroes having abandon'd it, and gone
!«thet South, for fear of the Msors; and the-Mm*
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its
Barrenness; and indeed both forsaking it because
of the prodigious Numbers of Tygers, Lyons,
Leopards, and other furious Creatures which har-
bour there; so that the Moors use it for their Hun-
ting only, where they go like an Army, two or
three thousand Men at a time; and indeed for near
an hundred miles together upon this Coast, we saw
nothing but a waste uninhabited Country by Day,
and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of
Wild Beasts by Night.
Once or twice in the Day-time, I thought I saw
the Pko of Teneriffe, being the high Top of the
Mountain "teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a great
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice, I was forced in again by
contrary Winds, the Sea also going too high for
my little Vessel; so I resolv'd to pursue my first
Design, and keep along the Shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh Wa-
ter, after we had left this Place; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the Morning, we came to
an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was
pretty high, and the Tide beginning to slow, we
lay still to go farther in ; Xury, whose Eyes were
more about him than it seems mine were, calls soft-
ly to me, and tells me that we had best go farther
off the Shore; for, fays he, look yonder lies a
dreadful Monster on the Side of that Hillock, fast
asleep: I look'd where he pointed, and saw a
dreadful Monster indeed; for it was a terrible great
Lion that lay on the fide of the Shore, under the
Shade ofa piece of the Hill that hung as it were a
little over him. Xury, fays I, you sttall go on Shore
and kill him; Xstry look'd frighted, and said,
Me kiU! be eat me at one Mouth; one Mouthful he
meant; however, I said no more to the Boy, but
bad
C 3« 3 .
bad him be still, and I tookour biggest Gun, which
was almost Musket-bore, and loaded it with a
good Charge of Powder, and with two Slugs, and
laid it down; then I loaded another Gun with
two Bullets, and the third (for we had three Pieces)
1 loaded with five smaller Bullets. I took the best
Aim I could with the first Piece to have {hot him
into the Head; but he lay so with his Leg rais'd
a little above his Nose, that the Slugs hit his Leg
about the Knee, and broke the Bone. He started
up growling at first, but, finding his Leg broke, fell
down gain, and then got up upon three Legs,
and gave the most hideous Roar that ever I heard:
I was a little surprized that I had not hit him on
the Head ; however, I took up the second Piece im-
mediately, and tho' he began to move osf, fir'd a-
|ain, and shot him into the Head, and had the
Pleasure to see him drop, and make but little Noise,
but lay struggling for Lise. Then Xury took Heart,
and would have me let him go on Shore : Well, go,
»id I. So the Boy jump'd into the Water, and ta-
king a little Gun in one Hand, swam to Shore with
the other Hand, and coming close to the Creature,
j>w the Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear, and (hoc
into the Head again, which dispatched him
quite.
This was Game indeed to us, but this was no
wed; and I was very sorry to lose three Charges
« Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was good

y brought it with him, and h was a monstrous
Peat one.
* .
1 be-
I bethought my self however> that perhaps the
Skin of him might one way or other be of some
value to us; and I resolv'd to take off his Skin if
I could. So Xury and I went to wdrk with him;
but Xury was much the better Workman at it, for
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us
up both the whole Day, but at last we got off
the Hide of him; and spreading it on the top of
pur Cabin, the Sun efsectually dried it in two
Days time, and it afterwards scrv'd me to lie upon.
After this Stopi we made on to the Southward
continually for ten or twelve Days, living very
sparing on our Provisions, which began to abate
very much, and going no oftner in to the Shore than
we were obliged to for fresh Water. My design in
th;s was to make the River Gambia or Senegal!, that
is to fay, any where about the Cape de Verd, where
I was in hopes to meet with some European Ship4
and if I did not, I knew not what Course I had to
take, but to seek for the Ijlands, or perish there a-
mong the Negroes. I knew that all the Ships from
Europe, which sail'd either to the Coast of Guiney,
or to Brasil, or to the East Indies, made this Cape,
or those Iflands; and in a word, I put the whole
of my Fortune upon this single Point, either that
I must meet with some Ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this Resolution about teii
Days longer, as I have said, I began to see that the
Land was inhabited, and in two or three Places
as we sailed by, we saw People stand upon the
Shore to look at us; we could also perceive they
were quite black and stark naked. I was once
inclin'd to have gone on Shore to them; but Xury
was my better Counsellor, and said to me, No go,
no go; however, I haul'd in nearer the Shore, that I
might talk to them, and I found they run along
the Shore by me a good way. I observ'd they bad
no
no Weapons in their Hands, except one, who had
along (lender Stick, which Xury said wa$ a Lance,
and that they would throw them a great way with
good Aim; so I kept at a distance, but talk'd with
them by Signs as well as I could, and particularly
made Signs for something to eat; they beckon'd to
me to stop my Boat, and they would setch me
some Meat; upon this I lower'd the Top of my
Sail, and lay by, and two of them run up into the
Country, and in less than half an Hour came back
and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flesh,
and some Corn, such as is the Produce of their
Country; but we neither knew what the one or the
other was; however, we were willing to accept it.
But how. to come at it was our next Dispute ;s for
I was not for venturing on Shore to them, and they
were as much afraid of us; but they took a safe
Way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore
*nd laid it down, and went and stood a great way
off, till we setch'd it on Board, and then .came;
close to us again.'"'
We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an Opportu-
nity osser'd that very Instant, to oblige them won-
derfully; for while we were lying by the Shore,
came two mighty Creatures, one pursuing the other
(« we took it) with great Fury,from the Mountains
towards the Sea; whether it was the Male pursuing
Female, or whether they were In Sport or in
^ge, we could not tell, any more than we could
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it
WJS the latter; because in the first place those ra-
Te"°?s Creatures seldom appear but in the Night;
*"d in the second place, we found the People terri-
jty frighted, especially the Women. The Man that
sty from them,
twoCreaw1*8
ran
ran directly into the Water, they did not seem to
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plung'd
themselves into the Sea, and swam about as if they
had come for their Diversion; at last one of them
began to come nearer our Boat than at first I ex-
pected, but I lay ready for him, for 1 had loaded
my Gun with all possible Expedition, and bid
Xury load both the other; as soon as he came fair-
ly within my Reach I fir'd, and shot him directly
into the Head; immediately he funk down into
the Water, but rose instantly, and plung'd up and
down as if he was struggling for Lise, and so in-
deed he was; he immediately made to the Shore,
but between the Wound, which was his mortal
Hurt, and the strangling of the Water, he died just
before he reach'd the Shore. .
It is impossible to express the Astonishment of
these poor Creatures at the Noise and the Fire of
my Gun ; some of them were ready even to die for
-Fear,. and sell down as dead with the very Terror.
But when they saw the Creature dead, and sunk in
the Water, and that I made Signs to them to come
to the Shore, they took Heart, and came to the
Shore, and began to search for the Creature. I
sound him by his Blood staining the Water, and
by the help of a Rope, which I slung round him,
and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragg'd him on
Shore, and found that it was a most curious Leo-
pard, spotted and fine to an admirable degree;
and the Negroes held up their Hands with. Admira-
tion, to think what it was I had killed him with.
The other Creature, frighted with the Flash of
Fire and the Noise of the Gun, swam on Shore,
and rart up directly to the Mountains, from whence
they come, nor could I at that distance know
what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were
for eating the Flesli of this Creature, so I was wil-
ling to have them take it as a Favour from me,
which when I made Signs to them that they might
take him, they-were very thankful ior. Immediate-
ly they fell to work with him; and,tho' they had
no Knife, yet with a slurpeaed piece of Wood,they
took osf his Skin as readily, and much more readily
than we could have done with a Knise; they oftcr'd
me some of the Flesh, which I declin'd, making as
if I would, give it them, but made Signs for the
Skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their Provision, which tho
I did not understand, yet I accepted; then I made
Signs to them for some Water, and held out one of
my Jars to them, turning it Bottom upward, to
stew that it was empty, and that I wanted to have
it silled; they called immediately to some of their
Friends, and there came two Women and brought
a great Vessel made pf Earth, and burnt, as I sup-
pose, in the Sun; this they set down for me, as
before, and I, sent Xury on Shore with my Jars,
and filled, them all three. The Women were as
Mnaked as the Men./ V/ ;i *«.; .„ . a'ai;.,0...
I was now fumish'd with Roots andCorn, such
35 it was, and Water, and leaving my friendly ZVe-
P«, I made forward for about eleven Days more,
without offering to go near the Shore, tils I saw
the Land run out a great length into the Sea, at
about the distance of four or five Leagues before
*«. and the Sea being very calm, I kept a..large.
Offing to make this Point; at length, doiiblin'e-the.
roint at about two Leagues from the Land,- I
uw plainly Land on the other side to/Se^y'ard;
™n I concluded, as it was most certain indeed,
™» this was the Cape de Verd, and those the
p called from thence Cape de Verd Ifland-t.
However, they were at a great Distance, and I
Wuld not well tell what I had best to do; for if I
D 2 -' should
should be taken with a Fresh of Wind, I might
neither reach one or other.
In this Dilemma, as I was very pensive, I slept
into the Cabin, and fat me down, Xury having
the Helm, when on a sudden the Boy cry d out,
Master, Master, a Ship with a Sail! and the foolish
Boy was frighted out of his Wits, thinking it must
needs be some of his Master's Ships sent to put-
sue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough
out of their Reach. I jump'd out of the Cabin, -
and immediately saw not only the Ship, and what
slie was, (viz,.) that it was a Portuguese Ship, andy
as I thought, was bound to the Coast of Guiney for
Negroes: But when I observ'd theCourse she steer'd',
I was soon convinc'd they were bound some othet
way, and did not design to come any nearer to
the Shore; upon which I stretched out to Sea as
much as I could, resolving to speak with them if
possible. ";
With all the Sail 1 could make, I found I fihould
not be able to come in their Way, but that they
would be gone by, before I could make any Signal
to them; but after I had crowded to the utmost,
and began to despair, they it seems saw me by the
help of their Perspective-Glasses, and that it waa
tome European Boat, which they supposed must be-
long to some Ship that was lost; so they sl;ortned
Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my Patron's Antient on board, I
made a Waft of it to them for a Signal Of Distress*
and fir'd a Gun, both which they saw, for they
told me they saw the Smoke, tho* they did not
hear the Gun; upon these Signals they very kindly
brought to, and lay by for me, and in about three
Hours time I came up with them. 1
They ask'd me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spawst, and in French, but I understood none of
them;
them . but at last a Sailor who was on board
calld to me, and I answer'd him, and told him f
was ati that I bad made my Escape
out of Slavery from the Moors at Sattee; then they
them . but at last a Sailor who was on board

Brajil, and when it camfe there, if any one osfer'd
- to give more, he would make it up; he ofser'd me
also 60 Pieces of Eight more sot my Boy Xury,
which I was loth to take, not that I was not wil-
. ling to let the Captain have him, but I was very
loth ro sell the poor Boy's Liberty, who had assi-
sted me so faithfully in procuring my own- How-
ever, when I let him know my Reason, he own'd
it to be just, and osser'd me this Medium, that he
would give the Boy an Obligation to set him free
in 10 Years, if he turn'd Christian : Upon this, and
Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the
Captain have him. - .'
We had a very good Voyage to the Brafils, and
arriv'd in the Bayde Todis los Santos, or All-Saints-
Bay, in about 22 Days after. And how I was
once more deliver'd from the most miserable of all
Conditions of Lise, and what to do next with my
self, I was now to consider.
The generous Treatment the Captain gave me,
I can never enough remember; he would take no-
thing of me for my Passage, gave me 20 Ducats for
the Leopard's Skin, and 40 for the Lion's Skin
which I had in the Boat, and caused every Thing
I had in the Ship to be punctually deliver'd me,
and what I was willing to sell, he bought; such as
the Case of Bottles, two of my Guns, and a Piece
of the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made Candles
of the rest; in a word, I made about 220 Pieces of
Eight of all my Cargo, and with this Stock I went
on Shore in the Brasilia.
I had not been, long here, but being recommen-
ded to the House of a good honest Man like him-
self, 'who had an lntenio, as they call it; that is, a
* Plan-
Plantation and a Sugar-House, I liv'd with him
some time, and acquainted my self by that Means.
with the Manner of their Planting and making of
Sugar; and seeing how well the Planters liv'd, and
how they grew rich suddenly, I resolv'd, if I could
get Licence to settle there, 1 would turn Planter a-'
mongthem resolving in the mean time to find out
some Way to get my Money which 1 had left in Lon-
im, remitted to me. To this Purpose, getting a kind
oh Letter of Naturalization, I purchased as much
Land that was Uncur'd, as my Money would reach,
andfotm'd a Plan for my Plantation and Settlement,
and such a one as might be suitable to the Stock
which I propos'd to myself to receive from England.
I had a Neighbour, a Portuguezœ of Lisbon, but
born of Englijh Parents, whole^Name was Wj,
and in much such Circumstances as I was: I call
him Neighbour, because his Plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My
Stock was but low as well as his; and we rather
planted for Food, than any thing else, for about
two Years. However, we began to increase, and
our Land began to come into Order; so that the
third Year we planted some Tobacco, and made
each of us a large Piece of Ground ready for plant-
ing Canes in the Year to come; but we both want-
ed Help; and now I found more than before, I had
done wrong in parting with my Boy Xury.
But alas 1 for me to do wrong that never did right,'
was no great Wonder: I had no Remedy but to go
on: I was gotten into an Employment quite remote
to my Genius, and directly contrary to the Lise I
delighted in, and for which I forsook my Father's
House, and broke thro' all his good Advice; nay,
1 was coming into the very middle Sration, or up-
per Degree of low Life, which my Father advised,
»e to before* and which, if 1 resolved to go on

with, I might as well have staid at home, and
never have fatigued my self in the World as I have
done; and I used often to say to rny self, I could
have done this as well in England among my Friends,
as have gone 5000 Miles oft' to do it amongStran-
gers and Savages in a Wilderness, and at such a
Distance, as never to hear from any Part of the
World that had the least Knowledge of me.
|n this manner I used to look upon my Condi-
tion with the utmost Regret. I had no body to
converse with, but now and ;hen this Neighbour;
nb Work to be done, but by the Labour of my
Hands ; and I used to say, I liv'd just like a Man.
castaway upon some desolate Island, that had no
body there but himself. But how just has it been,
and how should all Men.reslect, that, when they
compare their present Conditions with others that
a^e worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the Ex-
change,and be convine'd of their former Felicity, by
their Experience: I say, how just has it been, that,
the,, truly solitary Lise I reslected on in an Island of
meet Desolation should be my Lot, who had so
often unjustly compared it with the Lise which I
th^ri led, in which had I continued, I had in all
probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.
X was'in some degree settled in my Measures for
carrying on the Plantation, before my kind Friend
the Captain ef the Ship, that took me up at Sea,
went back; for the Ship remained there in provi-
ding his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage,-
neat three Months, when telling him what little,
S(o.ek I had left behind me in London, he gave me
this.friendly and sincere Advice: Seignior luglese, fays
he,, for so he always called me, if you will give
me Letters, and a Procuration here in form to me,
with Orders to the Person who has your Money in
London, to send your Efsects to.Lisbon, tosuchPer-
,' sons
1 -»' 1
sons as I shall direct, and in such Goods as are pro-
per for rhis Country, I will bring you the Produce
of them, God willing, at my Return; but since
human Affairs are all subject to Changes and Dis-
asters, I would have you giveOrders but for 100 /.
Sterl. which you fay is half your Stock, and let the
hazard be run for the first; so that if it come sase,
you may order the rest the same way; and if it
miscarry, you may have the other half to have re-
course, to for your Supply. :-'-<' t
This was so wholsome Advice, and look'd so
friendly, that I could not but be convine'd it was
the best Course I could take; so I accordingly pre-
pared Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I
had left my Money, and a Procuration to the Por-
tuguese Captain, as he desired.
I wrote the Englifo Captain's Widow a full Ac-
count of all my Adventures, my Slavery, Escape,
and how I had met with the Portugal Captain ac
Sea, the Humanity of his Behaviour, and in what
Condition I was now in, with all other necessary
Directions for my Supply; and when this honest
. Captain came to Lisbon, he found' means by some of
the Enghjk Merchants there, to send over not the
Order only, but a full Account of my Story to a
Merchant at London, who represented it effectually
to her; whereupon she not only delivered the Mo-
"ey, but ©ut ot' her own Pocket sent the Portugal
Captain a very handsome Present for his Humanity
and Charity to me.
j The Merchant in London vested this 100 /. in
Englifl> Goods, such as the Captain had writ for;
sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought
them all safe to me to the Brasils; among which,
without my Direction (for I was too young in my
Business to think of them) he had taken care to
nave all sorts of Tools, Iron-work, and Uten-
fils necessary for my Plantation, and which were
of great Use to me. j ..
When this Cargo arriv'd, I thought my For-
tune made, for I was surpriz'd with Joy of it; and
ray good Steward the Captain had laid out the jJL
which my Friend had sent him for a Present for
himself, to purchase, and bring me over a Servant
under Bond for six Years Service, and would not
accept of any Consideration, except a little To-
bacco, which I would have him accept, being of
my own Produce.
Neither was this all; but my Goods being all
Englijh Manufactures, such as Cloth, Stuff, Bays,
and Things particularly valuable and desirable in
the Country, I found means to sell them to a very
great Advantage; so that I may fay, I had more
than four times the Value of my first Cargo, and
was now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour, I.
mean in the Advancement of my Plantation; for
the first Thing I did, I bought me a Negroe Slave,
and an European Servant also; I mean another be-
sides that which the Captain brought me from
But as abused Prosperity is oftentimes made the
very Means of our greatest Adversity, so was it
with me. I went on the next Year with great Suc-
cess in my Plantation: I raised 50 great Rolls of
Tobacco on my own Ground more than I had
disposed of for Necessaries among my Neighbours;
and these 50 Rolls being each of above a 100 Ib. Wt.
were well c'ur'd and laid' by against the Return of
the Fleet from Lisbon. And now increasing in Bu-
siness and in Wealth, my Head began to be full of
Pro;ects and Undertakings beyond my Reach; such
as are indeed often the Ruin of the best Heads in
Business. -!: .0 - . 1 . ; - ..-.''..j
Had
Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy Things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my Father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet retired Lise, and of which he had
so sensibly described the middle Station of Lise to
be full of; but other Things attended me, and I
was still to be the wilful Agent of all my own Mi-
series; and particularly to encrease by Fault, and
double the Reflections upon my self, which in my
future Sorrows I should have Leisure to make, all
these Miscarriages were procured by my apparent
obstinate adhering to my foolish Inclination of wan-
dring abroad, and pursuing that Inclination, in.
Contradiction to the clearest Views of doing my
self good in a fair and plain Pursuit of those Pro^
spects and those Measures of Lise, which Nature
and Providence concurred to present me with, and
to make my Duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away from
Parents, so I could not be content now, but I
roust go and leave the happy View I had of being
a rich and a thriving Man in my new Plantation,
only to pursue a rash and immoderate Desire of
rising faster than the Nature of the Thing admit-
ted; and thus I cast my self down again into the
deepest Gulph of human Misery that ever Man fell
"ito, or perhaps could be consistent with Lise and
a State of Health in the World.
To come then by just Degrees to the Particu-
lars of this Part of my Story; You may suppose,
that having now lived almost four Years in the
Brasilio, and beginning to thrive and prosper very
^ell upon my Plantation, I had not only learn'd
the Language, but had contracted Acquaintance
and Friendship among my Fellow-Planrers, as well
as among the Merchants at St. Sahvadore, which
was our Port; and that in my Discourse among

C. 44 G
them, I had ffequently given them an account of
my two Voyages to the Coast of Guiney, the man-
ner of trading with the Negroes there, and how
easy it was to purchase upon the Coast, for Tri-
fles (such as Beads, Toys, Knives, Scissors, Hat-
chets, Bits of Glass, and the like) not only Goldr
Dust, Ga/'sey-Grains, Elephants Teeth, &c.' but
Negroes for the Service of the &rafils, in great
Numbers. >r. . - - ,:
They listened always very attentively to my
Discourses on these Heads, but especially to that
part which related to the buying Negroes, which
was a Trade at that time not only not far entered
into, but as faras.it was, had been carried on by
the Assiento's,.or Permission, of the Kings of Sfain
and Portugal, and engross'd in the Publick; so that
sew Negroes were bought, and those excessive
dear. \ ~ "'
It happen'd, being in Company with some Mer-
chants and Planters of my Acquaintance, and
talking of those things very earnestsy, three of
them came to me the next Morning, and told me
they had been musing very much upon what I had
discoursed with them of the last Night, and they
came to make a secret Proposal to me ; and after
enjoining me Secrecy, they told me that they had
a mind - to fit oat a Ship to go to Guiney; that
they had all Plantations as well as I, and were
straitned for nothing so much as Servants; that as
it was a Trade that could not be carried on, be-
cause they could not publickly sell the Negroes
when they came home, so they desired to make
but one Voyage* to bring the Negroes on Shore
privately, and divide them among their -own
Plantations; and in a Word, the Question was,
whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the
$hip, to manage the Trading Part upon the Coast
toy Part of the Stock. !^oat providing
... ^ M&
ot me otock.: . - -:;-. - - .
This was a fair Proposal, it must be consess'd,
had it been made to any one that had not had a
Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after*
which was. in a fair way of coming to be very con-
siderable, and with a good Stock upon it. But for
me that was thus entered and establish'd, and had
nothing to do but go on as I had begun for three
or four Years more, and to have sent for the other
ioo /. from England, and who in that Time, and
with that little Addition, could scarce have fail'd
of being worth ? or Anon / - -1
«i unie Audition, could scarce have fail'd
of being worth 3 or 4000 /. Sterling, and that en-
creasing too; for me to think ofsueh a Voyage,
was the most preposterous thing that ever Man ia
siich Circumstances could, be guilty of.
But I that was born to be my own Destroyer,
could no more resist the Osser than I could restrain
my first rambling Designs, when my Father's good
Counsel was lost upon me. In a Word, I told
them I would go with »tt «•»* u
v. w*s ioit upon me. In a Word, I told
them I would go with all my Heart, if they
would undertake to look after my Plantation in
my Absence, and would dispose of it to such as I
would direct, if I miscarried - This they all en-
gaged to do, and entered into Writings, or Cove-
nants, to do so; arid I made a formal Will, dispo-
sing of my Plantation and Efsects, in case of my
Death, making the Captain of the Ship that had
fav'd my Life, Us before, my universal Heir, but
obliging him to dispose of my Essects as I had di-
rected in my Will, one half of the Produce be-
ing to himself, and the other to be-fiiipp'd to Eng*
ft short,-1'took *!! possible Caution to preserve
my Effects, and to keep up my Plantation ; had I
used half aVm.VVt.:. ^-' -r
-fook'd into my
own
own Interest, and have made a Judgment of wha
I ought to have done, and not to have done, I hac
certainly never gone away from so prosperous ar
Undertaking, leaving all the probable Views of i
thriving Circumstance, and gone upon a Voyage tc
Sea, attended with all its common Hazards; tc
fay nothing of the Reasons I had to expect parti
cular Missortunes to my self.
But I was hurry'd on, and obey'd blindly the
Dictates of my Fancy rather than my Reason: And
accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Car-
go furnish'dj and all things done as by Agreement,
by my Partners in the Voyage, I went on board
in an evil Hour again, the ist of Sept. 1659, being
the fame Day eight Years that I went from my
Father and Mother at Hull, in order to act the
Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to my own
Interest.
Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried
6 Guns and 14 Men, besides the Master, his Boy,
and my self; we had on board no large Cargo os
Goods, except of such Toys as were fit for our
Trade with the Negroes, such as Beads, Bits os
Glass, Shells, and odd Trisles, especially little
Looking-Glasles, Knives, ScisTars, Hatchets, and
the like.
The fame Day I went on board, we set Sail
standing away to the Northward upon our owr
Coast, with design to stretch over for the Ajrkai
Coast. When they came about 10 or 12 Degrees o
Northern Latitude, which it seems was the man
ner of their Course in those Days, we had ven
good Weather, only excessive hot, all the Way upoi
our own Coast, till we came to the Height o
Cape St. Augustim, from whence keeping farther ol
at Sea, we lost sight of Land, and steer'd as if w
were bound for the Isle Fernand deNtronha, holdini
[47 3
our Course N. E. by N. and leaving those Isles
on the East. In this Course we past the Line in
about « Days time, and were by our last Obser-
vation in 7 Degrees 22 Min. Northern Latitude,
when a violent Teurnado, or Hurrkane,took us quite
out of our Knowledge; it began from the South-
East, came about to the North-West, and then
settled into the North-East, from whence it blew
in such a terrible mariner, that for 12 Days toge-
ther we could do nothing but drive ; and scudding
away before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate
and the Fury of the Winds directed; and during
these 12 Days, I need not fay, that I expected
every Day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any
in the Ship expect to save their Lives.
In this Distress we had, besides the Terror of
the Storm, oneofour Men died of the Calenture,
and one Man and the Boy wash'd over-board. A-
bout the 12th Day the Weather abating a little,
the Master made an Observation as well as he
could, and found that he was in about ri Degrees
North Latitude, but that he was 22 Degrees of
Longitude Disference West from Cape St. Augusiino,
so that he found he was gotten upon the Coast of
Guiana, or the North Part of Brasil, beyond the
"-iver Amaz,ones, toward that of the River Oroo-
»oque, commonly called the Great River, and began
to consult with me what Course he should take,
for the Ship was leaky, and very much disabled,
and he was going directly back to the Coast of
1 was positively against that, and looking over
the Charts of the Sea-Coast of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited Country for
"s to have recourse to, till we came within the
Circle of the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved
to stand away for Barbados, which by keeping osf
«t Sea, to avoid the Indraught of the Bay or Gulp!
of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped
in about fifteen Days Sail; whereas we could noi
possibly make our Voyage to the Coast of Africa.
without some Assistance both to our Ship and tc
our selves.
With this Design we chang'd Our Course, and
sieer'd away N. W. by W. in order to reach som<
of our Englijh Islands, where I hoped for Reiief
but our Voyage was otherwise derermined, for be-
ing in the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a seconc
Storm,came upon us, which carry'd us away wit!
the fame Impetuosity Westward, and drove us si
out of the very way of all human Commerce
that had all our Lives been saved, as to the Sea
we were rather in danger of being devourec
by Savages, than ever returning to our owi
Country.
In this Distress, the Wind still blowing ver;
hard, one of our Men, early in the Morning, cry'c
put, Land; and we had no sooner run out of th<
Cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabout
in the World we were, but the Ship struck upon 1
Sand, and in a Moment, her Motion being s<
stopp'd, the Sea broke over her in such a mannet
that we expected we should all have perish'd im
mediately; and we were immediately driven int<
our close Quarters, to shelter us from the ver
Foam and Sprye of the Sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not bee
in the like Condition, to describe or conceive th
Consternation of Men in such Circumstances; w
knew nothing where we were, or upon what Lan
it was we were driven, whether an Island or t\
Main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; ^ an
as the Rage of the Wind was still great, the-' n
thex less than ac first, we could not so much;
linr
Zvl .
hope to have the Ship hold many Minutes with-
out breaking in Pieces, unless the vVinds by a kind
of Miracle should turn immediately about. In a
Word, we fat looking one upon another, and ex-
pecting Death every Moment, and every Man act-
ing accordingly, as preparing for another World,-
for there was litde or nothing more for us to do in
this; that which was our present Comfort, and
all the Comfort we had, was, that contrary to our
Expectation the Ship did not break yet, and that
the Master said the Wind began to abate.
Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little
abate, yet the Ship having thus struck upon the
Sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her get-
ting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of saving our
Lives as well as we could; we had a Boat at our
Stern, just before the Storm, but she was first stav'd
by dasiiing against the Ship's Rudder, and in the
next Place see broke away, and either funk or
was driven off to Sea, so there was no Hope from
net; we had another Boat on board, but how to
g« her off into the Sea, was a doubtful thing;
however, there was no room to debate, for we
sancy'd the Ship would break in pieces every Mi-
nute; and some told us, she was actually broken
already.
In thii Distress the Mate of our Vessel lays hold
of the Boat, aud with the help of the rest of the
Men, they got her slung over the Ship's side, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed our
•elves, being Eleven in number, to God's Mercy;
and the wild Sea; for tho' the Storm was abated
considerably, yet the Sea went dreadful high upon
we Shore, and might well be call'd Den wild Zeet
as the Dutch call the Sea in a Storm. .
Pan I. E Aat
And now our Case was very dismal indeed; sot
we all saw plainly, that the Sea went so high, that
the Boat could not live, and that we should be ine-
vitably drowned. As to making Sail, we had none,
nor, if we had, could we have done any Thing with
it; so we work'd at the Oar towards the Land,
tho' with heavy Hearts, like Men going to Executi-
on ; for we all knew, that when the Boat came near-
er the Shore, ihe would be dash'd in a thousand
Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. However, we
committed our Souls to God in the most earnest
manner, and the Wind driving us towards the.
Shore, we hasten'd our Destruction with our owa
Hands, pulling as well as we could towards Land.
What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand,
whether Steep or Shoal;, we knew not; the only
Hope that could rationally give us the least shadow
of Expectation, was, if we might happen into some
Bay or Gulph, or the mouth of some River, where
by great Chance we might have run our Boat in, or
got under the Lee of the Land, and perhaps made
smooth Water. But there was nothing of this ap-
peared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
Shore, the Land look'd more frightful than the Se&
After we had row'd, or rather driven about a
League and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging
Wave, Mountain-like, came rowling a-stern of us,
and plainly bid us expect the Coup de Grace. In
a word, it took us with such a Fury, that it over-
set the Boat at once, and separating us as well
from the Boat, and from one another, gave us not
time hardly to fay, O God! for we were all swal-
lowed up in a Moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of Thought
which I selt when I sunk into the Water; for tho' I
swam' very well, yet I could not deliver my self from
th« Wa?es so as to draw Breath, till that Wave
having
Ut ]
havftig driven me, or rather carried me a vast Way
on towards the ShoTe, and hiving spent it self, went
back, and left me upon the Land almost dry, but
half dead with the Water I took in: I had so much
Presence of Mind, as well as Breath left, that seeing
my self nearer the main Land than I expected, I got
upon my Feet, and endeavoured to make on to-
wards the Land as fast as I could, before another
Wave should return, and take me up again. But I
soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw
the Sea come after me as high as a great Hill, and
as furious as an Enemy, which I had no Means or
Strength to contend with; my Business was to hold
my Breath, and raise my self upon the Water, if I
could, and so by swimming to preserve my Breath-
ing, and Pilot my self towards the Shore, if possi-
ble; my greatest Concern now being, that the Sea,
as it would carry me a great Way towards the
Shore when it came on, might not carry me back
again with it when it gave back towards the Sea.
The Wave that came upon me again, buried mq
at once 20 or 30 Foot deep in its own Body; and I
could seel my self carried' with a mighty Force and
Swiftness towards the Shore a very great way; but
J held my Breath, and assisted my self to swim still
forward with all my Might. I was ready to burst
with holding my Breath, when, 'as* I felt my self
Vsmg up, sq, to my immediate Relief, I found my
Head and Hands.Qioot out above the Surface of the
Water; and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time
that I could keep my self so, yet it reliev'd me
greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was
covered again with Water a good while, but not
so long but I held it out; and finding the W*1"
had spent it self, and began to return, I struck for-
ward against rhe Return of the Waves, and felt
^OUnd agaia with my Eeet. I stood fiiU a sew
E z Moments
Moments to recover Breath, and till the Water
went from me, and then took to my Heels, and
run with what Strength 1 had farther towards the
Shore. But neither would this deliver me from
the Fury of the Sea, which came pouring in after
me again, and twice more 1 was lifted up by the
Waves, and carried forwards as before, the Shore
being very slat.
The last time of these two had well near been
fatal to me; for the Sea having hurried me along
as before, landed me, or rather dash'd me against a
piece of a Rock, and that with such Force, as it
left me senilese, and indeed helpless, as to my own
Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and
Breast, beat the Breath as it were quite out of my
Body; and had it returned again immediately, I
must have been strangled in the Water; but I re-
cover' d a little before the Return of the Waves,
and seeing I should be cover'd again with the
Water, 1 refolv'd to hold fast by a piece t>f the
Rock, and so to hold my Breath, if possible, till
the Wave went back; now as the Waves were noc
so. high as at first, being near Land, I held my
Hold till the Wave abated, and then setch'd ano-
ther Run, which brought me so near the Shore,
that the next Wave, tho' it went over me, yet did
not so swallow me up, as to carry me away, and
the next Run I took, I got to the main Land,'
where, to my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the
Gifts of the Shore, and fat me down upon the
Grass, free from Danger, and quite out of the
Reach of the Water.
I was now landed, and sase on Shore, and began
to look up and thank God that my Lise was sav'd in
a Case wherein there was some Minutes before scarce
any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to ex-
press to the Lise what the Extasies and Transports of
... the
the Soul are, when it is so sav'd, as I may fay, out
of the very Grave; and I do not wonder now ac
that Custom, viz,. That when a Malefactor, who
has the Halter about his Neck, is tied up, and just
going to be turn'd off, and has a Reprieve brought
to him; I fay, I do not wonder that they bring a
Surgeon with it, to let him Blood that very Mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the Surprize may not
drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart, and over-
whelm him: -.:»-:.:.;...
For sudden Joys, like Griefs, conjound at first.
Iwalk'dabouton the Shore, lifting up my Hands,
and my whole Being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the
Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a thou-
sand Gestures and Motions which I cannot describe,
reflecting upon all myComrades that were drown'd,
and that there should not be one Soul sav'd but my
felf; for as for them, I never saw them afterwards,
or any sight of them, except three of their Hats,
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows;
I cast my Eyes to the stranded Vessel, when the
Breach and Froth of the Sea being so big, I could
hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord5
how was it possible I could get on Shore!
After I had solac'd my Mind with the comforta-
ble part of my Condition, I began to look round
me, to see what kind of Place I was in, and what
Was next to be done, and I soon found my Comforts
abate, and that, in a Word, I had a dreadful Delive-
rance; for I was wet, had no Cloaths to shift me,
nor any thing either to eat or drink to comfort me,
neither did I see any Prospect before me, but thac
™ Perishing with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild
B=asts: And that which was particularly Afstict'nS
to me, was, that I had no Weapon either to hunt
E 3 *"*
and kill any Creature for my Sustenance, .or to de-
send my self against any other Creature that might
desire to kill me for theirs: In a Word, I had no-
thing about me but a Knise, a Tobacco-pipe, and
a little Tobacco in a Box; this was all my Provi-
sion, and this threw me into terrible Agonies of
Mind, that for a while I run about like a Mad-man.
Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
Heart to consider what wpuld be my Lot, if there
were any ravenous Beasts in that Country, seeing at
Night they always come abroad for their Prey.
Al l the Remedy that ofter'd to my Thoughts at
that time, was, to get up into a thick bustiyTree
like a Fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolv?d to sit all Night, and consider the
next Day what Death I should dye, for as yet I
saw no Prospect of Lise. I walk?d about a Furlong
from the Shore, to see if I could find any fresli
Water to drink, which I did, to my great Joy;
and having drank, and put a little Tobacco in my
Mouth to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree,
and getting up into it, endeavour'd to place my
self so, as that if I should sleep, I might not fall;
and having cut me a short Stick, like a Truncheon,
for my Desence, I took up my Lodging, and ha-
ving been excessively fatigu'd, I sell fast afleep, and
slept as comfortably as, I believe, sew could have
done in my Condition, and found my self die most
refreshed with it, that I think I ever was on such an
Occasion.
When 1 wak'd it was broad Day, the Weather
clear, and the Srorm abated, so that the Sea dW
not rage and swell as before: But that which sur-
priz'd me most, was, that the Ship was lifted osf
in the Night from the Sand where she lay, by
the Swelling of the Tide, and was driven up al-
most as far as the Rock which I Hist mentjon'd,
where
where I had been so bruis'd by the dashing me a-
gainst it; this being within about a Mile from the
Shore where I was, and the Ship seeming to stand
upright still, I wish'd my self on board, that, at
least, I might fave some necessary Things for my
Use. ^ ^ -'
When I came down from my Apartment in the
Tree, I look'd about me again, and the first thing
I found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and
the Sea had toss'd her up upon the Land, about
two Miles on my Right Hand; I walk'd as far as I
could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found
a Neck or Inlet of Water between me and the
Boat, which was about half a mile broad; so I
came back for the present, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship, where 1 hop'd to find some-
thing for my present Subsistence.
A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm,
and the Tide ebb'd so far out, that I could come
within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship: And here
I found a fresh renewing of my Grief; for I saw
evidently, that if we had kept on Board, we had
wen all sase, that is to fay, we had all got sase
on Shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be
'eft entirely destitute of a\! Comfort and Conw
pany, as I now was : This forced Tears from my
%es again, but as there was little Relief in that,
I resolv'd, if possible, to get to the Ship; so I
pull'd osf my Cloaths, for the Weather was hot to
Extremity, and took the Water; but when I came
Jo the Ship, my Difficulty was still greater to
know how to get on board, for as she lay a-ground,
*nd high out of the Water, there was nothing
within my Reach to lay hold of; I swam round
net twice, and the second time I espy'd a small
piece of Rope, which I wonder'd I did not see
« sitst, hang down by the Fore-Chains so sow,
E 4 **
as that with great Disficulty I got hold of it, and
by the Help of that Rope, got up into the Fore-
castle of the Ship. Here I found that the Ship was
bulg'd, and had a great deal of Water in her Hold,
but that she lay so on the Side of a Bank of hard
Sand, or rather Earth, and her Stern lay lifted up
upon the Bank, and her Head low almost to the
Water; by this means all her Quarter was free,
and all that was in that Part was dry; for you
may be sure my sirst Work was to search
and to see what was spoil'd, and what was
free; and first I found, that all the Ship's Pro-
visions were dry, and untouch'd by the Water,
and being very well disposed to eat, I went to
the Bread-room and fill'd my Pockets with Bis-
ket, and eat it as I went about other things, sot
I had no Time to lose. I also found some Rum
in the great Cabin, of which I took a large Dram,
and which I had indeed need enough ot to spirit
me for what was before me. Now I wanted
nothing but a Boat to furnish my self with many
things which I foresaw would be very necessary
to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was
not to be had, and this Extremity rouz'd my
Application. We had several spare Yards, and
two or three large Sparrs of Wood, and a spare
Top-mast or two in the Ship ; I resolv'd to fall to
work with these, and slung as many of them
over-board as I could manage of their Weight,
tying every one with a Rope that they might
not drive away; when this was done, I went
down the Ship's Side, and pulling them to me, I
ty'd four of them fast together at both Ends as
well as I could, in the Form of a Raft, and laying
two or three short pieces of Plank upon them
cross-ways; I found I could walk upon it very
well,
1

well, but that it was not able to bear any great
Weight, the Pieces being too light; so I went to'
work, and with the Carpenter's Saw I cut a spare
Top-mast into three Lengths, and added them to
my Raft, with a gteat deal of Labour and Pains;
but the Hope of furnishing my self with Necessaries,
encouraged me to go beyond what I should have
been able to have done upon another Occasion.
My Raft was now strong enough to bear any
reasonable Weight; my next Care was what to
load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon
it from the Surf of the Sea; but I was not long
considering this; I first laid all the P.anks or Boards
upon it that I could get, and having consider'd well
what I most wanted; I first got three of the Sea-
mens Chests, which I had broken open and emp-
ty'd, and lower*d them down upon my Raft; the
first of these I fill'd with Provisions, viz,. Bread,
Rice, three Dutch Cheeses, five Pieces of dry'd
Goats-Fled, which we liv'd much upon, and a lit-
tle Remainder of European Corn, which had been
laid by for some Fowls which we brought to Sea
with us, but the Fowls were kill'd; there had been
some Barley and Wheat together, but, to my great
Disappointment, I found afterwards that the Rats
had eaten or spoil'd it all. As for Liquors, I found
several Cases of Bottles belonging to our Skipper,
m which were some Cordial Waters, and in all
about five or six Gallons of Rack; these I stow'd
Py themselves, there being no need to put them
into the Chest, nor no room for them. While I was
d°ing this, I sound the Tide began to slow, tho'
^ty calm, and I had the Mortisication to see my
Coat, Shirt, and Wastecoat, which I had left on
Snort upon the Sand, swim away; as for my
Breeches, which were only Linnen and open-kneed,
1 warn on board in them and my Stockings: How-
evcr?
ever this put me upon rummaging for Cloaths, of
which I found enough, but cook no more than t
wanted for present Use, for 1 had other Things
which my Eye was more upon; as first, Tools to
work with on Shore, and it was after long search-
ing that I found out the Carpenter's Chest, which
was indeed a very useful Prize to me, and much
more valuable than a Ship-loading of Gold would
have been at that time; I got it down to my Raft,
even whole as it was, without losing Time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contain'd.
My next Care was for some Ammunition and
Arms; there were two very good Fowling-Pieces
in the great Cabin, and two Pistols; these I se-
cur'd first, with some Powder-Horns, and a small
Bag of Shot, and two old rusty swords: I knew
there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship,
but knew not where our Gunner had stow'd them,
but with much search I sound them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken Water; those
two I got to my Raft, with the Arms: And now I
thought my self pretty well freighted, and beg:.n
to think how I slrould get to Shore with their,
having neither Sail, Oar, or Rudder, and the least
Cap full of Wind would have overset all my Navi-
gation. ..
I had three Encouragements. 1. A smooth
calm Sea. 2. The Tide rising and setting into
the Shore, a. What little Wind there was, blew
me towards the Land; and thus, having found two
or three broken Oars belonging to the Boat, and
besides the Tools which were in the Chest, I found
two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this
Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile or thereabouts, my
Raft went very well, only that I found it drive a
little distant from the Place where I had landed be-
fore, by which Iperceiv'd that there was someln^
draught
C 58 ]
draught pf the Water, and consequently I hop'd to
find some Creek or River there, which I mighc
make use of as a Port to get to Land with my
Cargo. -;
As I imagin'd, so it was; there appear'd before
me a little opening of the Land, and I found a
strong Current of the Tide set into it; so I guided
my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Mid-
dle of the Stream: But here I had like to have
lusfer'd a second Shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think verily would have broke my Heart; for
knowing nothing of the Coast, my Raft run a-
ground at one End of it upon a Shoal, and not be-
ing a-ground at the other End, it wanted but a
little that all my Cargo had slipp'd osf towards that
End that was a-sloat, and so fallen into the Water:
I did my utmost by setting my Back against the
Chests, to keep them in their Places, but could
not thrust off tlH Raft with all my Strength, nei-
ther durst I stir from the Posture I was in, but hold-
ing up the Chests with all my Might, stood in that
manner near half an Hour, in which time the rising
of the Water brought me a little more upon a Le-
*e], and a little after, the Water still rising, my
Rift sloated again, and I thrust her off with the
Wtt I had, into the Channel, and then driving up
mgher, I at length found my self in the Mouth of
* little River, with Land on both Sides, and a
strong Current orTide running up ; Ilook'd on both
aides for a proper Place to get to Shore, for I was
not willing to be driven too high up the River,
J°ping in time to see some Ship at Sea, and there-
fore resolv'd to place my self as near the Coast as
IcoQld.
At length I fpy'd a little Cove on the right
*W« of the Creek, to which with great Pain and
difficulty I guided my Raft, and at last got so near,
as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I could
thrust her directly in; but here I had like to have
dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again; lor that Shore
lying pretty steep, that is to fay, Hoping, there
was no Place to land,, but where one End of the
Float, if it run on Shore, would lie so high, and
the other sink lower as before, that it would en-
danger my Cargo again: All that I could do, was
to wait till .the Tide was at the highest, keeping
the Raft with my Oar, like an Anchor to hold the
Side of it fast to the Shore, near a slat Piece of
Ground, which I expected the Water would slow
over; and so it did: As soon as I sound Water
enough, (for my Raft drew about a Foot of Water)
I thrust her upon that slat Piece of Ground, and
there fasten'd, or moor'd, her, by sticking my two
broken Oars into the Ground; one on one Side
near one End, and one on the other Side near the
other End; and thus I lay till thf Water ebb'd a-
way, and left my Raft and all my Cargo sase on
Shore.
My next Work was to view the Country, and
seek a proper Place for my Habitation, and where
to stow my Goods, to secure them from whatever
might happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whe-
ther on the Continent, or on an Island ; whether in-
habited, or not inhabited; whether in Panger of
Wild Beasts or not: There was a Hill not above
a Mile from me, which rose up very steep and high,
and. which scem'd to over-top some other Hills
which lay as in a Ridge from it Northward: I took
out one of the Fowling-Pieces, and one of the Pi-
stols, and an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I
travelled for Discovery up to the Top of that Hill,
where after I had with great Labour and Disficul-
ty aot up to the Top, I saw my Fare to my great
Affliction (viz,.) that I was in an Island environ'd
every
I 61 3
every way with the Sea, no Land to be seen, ex-
cept some Rocks which lay a great way oft', and
two small Islands less than this, which lay abouc
three Leagues to the West.
I found a.so that the Island I was in was barren,
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited,
except by wild Beasts, of whom however I saw
none, yet I saw abundance of Fowls, but knew
not their Kinds, neither when I kill'd them could
I tell what was fits for Food, and what not. At my
coming back, I shot at a great Bird which I saw
sitting upon a Tree on the Side of a great Wood; I
believe it was the first Gun that had been fir'd
there since the Creation of the World; I had no
sooner fir'd, but from all the Parts of the Wood
there arose an innumerable Number of Fowls of
nany sorts, making a confus'd Screaming, and
trying every one according to his usual Note; but
not one of them of any Kind that I knew: As for
that Creature I kill'd, I took it to be a kind of a
Hawk, its Colour and Beak resembling it, but had
no Talons or Claws more than common, its Flesh
was Carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this Discovery, I came back to
my Raft, and sell to work to bring my Cargo on
Shore, which' took me up the rest of that Day,
"hat to do with my self at Night I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest ; for I was afraid to lie
down on the Ground, not knowing but some
wild Beast might devour me, though, as I after-
wards found, there was really no need for those
Fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricado'd my
•elf round with the Chests and Boards that I had
brought on shore, and made a kind of a Hutt for
that Night's Lodging; as for Food, I yet saw not
*nich Way to supply my self, except that I had
.-cr. ' seen
seen two or three Creatures like Hares run oat of
the Wood where I shot the Fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a
great many things out of the Ship, which wouid be
useful to me, and particularly some of the Rigging
and Sails, and such other things as might come to
Land, and I resolv'd to make another Voyage oh v
Board the Vessel, if possible; and as I knew that
the first Storm that blew must necessarily break her
all in Pieces, I resolv'd to set all other things apart,
till I got every thing out of the Ship that I could
get; then I call'd a Council, that is to fay, in my
Thoughts, whether I should take back the Raft,
but this appear'd impracticable; so I resolv'd to
go as before, when the Tide was down, and I
did so, only that I stripp'd before I went from my
.Hutt, having nothing on but a checquer'd Shirt,
and a pair of Linnen Drawers, and a pair of Pumps
on my Feet.
I got on Board the Ship as before, and prepar'd
a second Raft, and having had Experience of the
first, I neither made this so unweildy, nor loaded
it so hard, but yet I brought away several things
very useful to me; as first, in the Carpenter's Scores
I found two or three Bags full of Kails and Spikes,
a great Skrew-Jack, a dozen or two of Hatchets,
and above all, that most useful thing call'd a Grind-
stone; all these I secur'd together, with several
things belonging to the Gunner, particularly twd
ot three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of Mufquet-
Bullets, seven Musquets, and another Fowling-
Piece, with some small Quantity of Powder more;
a large Bag full of small Shot, and a great Roll of
Sheet Lead; but this last was so heavy, I could
not hoist it up to get it over the Ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the Men's Cloaths
that I could find, and 2 spare Fore-top-sail, Ham-
mock,
mock and some Bedding; and with this I loaded
my second Raft, and brought them all sase on Shore
to my very great Comfort.
I was under some Apprehensions during roy Ab-
sence from the Land, that at least my Provisions
might be devour'd on Shore; but when I came back
I found no sign- of ahy Visitor, only there fat a
Creature like a wild Cat upon one of the Chests,
which when I came towards it, ran iway a little
Distance, and then stood still; she sat very com-
pos'd, and uneoncern'd, and look'd full in my Face,
as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me:
I presented my Gun at her, but as she did not un-
derstand it, she was persectly unconcerned at it,
nor did she osser to stir away; upon which I toss'd
her a bit of Bisket, tho' by the way I was not very
free of it, for my Store was not great. However,
I spar'd her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smell'd
of it, and eat it, and look'd (as pleas'd) for more;
but I thank'd her, and could spare no more, so
&e march'd off.
Having got my second Cargo on Shore, (tho' I
was fain to open the Barrels ef Powder, and bring
them by Parcels, for they were too heavy, being
ktge Casks,) I went to work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and some Poles which I cut sot
that Purpose; and into this Tent I brought every
Thing that I knew would spoil, either with Rain,
« Sun, and I piled all the empty Chests and Cask}
DP in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it front
any sudden Attempt, either from Man or Beast.
When I had done this, I block'd up the Door of
the Tent with some Boards within, and an empty
Chest set up an End without, and spreading one
of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pi-
stols just at my Head, and my Gun at Length by
»e, Iwent to bed.fcr the; first time, and slep*
very
very quietly all Night, for I was very weary and
heavy, for the Night before I had slept little, and
had labour'd very hard all Day, as well to setch
all those Things from the Ship, as to get them on
Shore.
I had the biggest Magazine of all Kinds now
that ever were laid up, I believe, for one Man?
but I was not satissied still; for while the Ship sac
upright in »hat Posture, I thought I ought to get
every thing out of her that I could; so every day
at low Water I went on board, and brought away
something or other: But particularly the third
Time I wenr, I brought away as much of the Rig-
ging as I could, as also all the small Ropes and
Rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare Can-
vas, which was to mend the Sails upon occasion,'
and the Barrel of wet Gun-powder: In a Word, I
brought away all the Sails sirst and last, only that
I was fain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as
much at a Time as I could ; for they were no more
useful to be Sails, but as meer Canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still, was,
that at last of all, after I had made five or six such
Voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the Ship that was worth my med-
dling with; I fay, after all this, I found a great HogJ
shead of Bread, and three large Runlets of Rum jpr
Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine
Flower; this was surprizing to me, because I had
given over expecting any more Provisions, except
what was sooil'd by the Water: I soon empty'd
the Hogshead of that Bread, and wrapt it up,
Parcel by Parcel, in Pieces of the Sails, which I
cut out; and in a Word, I got all this sase on
.Shore also.
Whe next Day I made another Voyage; and
now having plunder'd the SJiip of what was porta-
ble
'ble, and fit to hand out, I began with the Cables;
and catting the great Cable into Pieces, such as I
could move, I got two Cables and a Haulscr on
Shore, with all the Iron-work I could get; and
having cut down the Spritlail-yard, and the Mi-
sen-yard, and every thing I could to make a large
Raft, I loaded it with all those heavy Goods, and
came away: But my good Luck began now to
leave me; for this Raft was so unweildy, and so
overladen, that after I was enter'd the little Cave,
where I had landed the rest of my Goods; nor.
being able to guide it so handily as 1 did the other,
it overset, and threw me and all my Cargo into
the Water: As for my self it was no great Harm,
for I was near the Shore; but as to my Cargoe, it
was great part of it lost, especially the Iron, which
I expected would have been of great Use to me:
However, when the Tide was out, I got most of
the Pieces of Cable ashore, and some of the Iron,
tho' with infinite Labour, for I was fain to dip for
it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd me very
much ; after this, I went every Day on Board,
and brought away what I could get.
I had been now 13 Days on Shore, and had been
ti times on Board the Ship j in which time I had
brought away all that one pair of Hands could
Well be suppos'd capable to bring, tho' I believe
verily, had the calm Weather held; I should have
brought away the whole Ship , Piece by Piece:
But preparing the t ath time to go on Board, I found
the Wind began to rise; however, at low Water I
went on Board, and tho' I thought I had rum-
maged the Cabin so efsedually, as that nothing
more could be found, yet I discovered a Locked
with Drawers in it, in one of which I found two
W three Razors, and one pair of large Scislars,
*"h some ten ot a dozen of good Knives and
Parti. F Forks;
Forks; in another I found about thirty six pounds
Value in Money, some European Coin, some Brafil,
some Pieces or Eight, some Gold, some Silver.
I smil'd to my selt at the sight of this Money.
0 Drug! said I aloud, what art thou good for?
Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off
of the Ground; one of those. Knives is worth all
this Heap; I have no manner of use for thee, e'en
remain where thou art, and go to the Bottom as
a Creature whose, Lise is not worth saving. How-
ever, upon second Thoughts, I tcok it away, and
wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, I began
to think of masting another Raft; but while I was
preparing this, I found the Sky over-cast, and the
Wind began to rise , and in a quarter of an Hour,
it blew a fresh Gale from the Shore ; it presently
occur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a Raft with the Wind osf Shore, and that it
was my Business to be gone before the Tide of
Flood began, otherwise I might not be able to
reach the Shore -at all: Accordingly I let my self
down into the Water, and swam cross .the Channel,
which lay between the Ship and the Sands, and
even that with Difficulty enough, partly with the
weight of the things I had about me, and partly
the roughness of the Water, fqr the Wind rose very
hastily, and before it was quite high Water, it blew
a Storm. . . - ,
But I was gotten home to my .little'Tent, where
1 lay with all my Wealth about me very secure. It
blew very hard all that Night, and in the Morning
when I look'd out, behold no more Ship was to be
seen. I was a little surpriz'd, but recover'd my
/elf with this satisfactory Reflection, viz,. That |
had lost no Time, nor abated no Diligence to get
every thing out of her that could be useful to me,
and that indeed.there was little left in her that I
was
was able to bring away, if I had had more Time.
1 now gave-over any more Thoughts ot' the
Ship, or of any thing out of her, except what
might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed
divers Pieces of her afterwards did; but those
things were of small use to me.
My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd about
securing myself' against either Savages, if any
should appear, or wild Beasts, if any were in the
Island; and t had.many Thoughts of the Method
how to do this, and what kind of Dwelling to
make; whether I should make me a Cave in the
Earth, or a Tent upon the Earth: And, in short,
1 refolv'd upon both; the Manner and Description
of which it may not be improper to give an Ac-
count of.
I soon found the Place I was in was not for my
Settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moorish Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd would
not be wholfome, and more particularly because
there was no freih Water near it; so i refolv'd to
find a more healthy and more convenient Spot of
Ground.
1 consulted several things in my Situation,whicH
J found Would be proper for me; first, Health, and
fresh Water I just now mentioned; secondly, Shel-
ter from the Heat of the Sun; thirdly, Security
from ravenous Creatures, whether Man or Beast;
fourthly, A View to the Sea, that if God sent any
Sl,ip in sight, I might not lose any Advantage sot
mv deliverance, for which I was not willing to
Mnish all my Expectation yet.
'n search of a Place proper for this, T found a
J** Plain on the side of a rising Hill, whose
front towards this little. Plain was steep as a
House-side, so that nothing could come down up-
on me from the Top: on the side of this Rock
... a F a there
there was a hollow Place worn a little way in, like
the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was
not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all.-
On the Flat of the Green, just before this hollow
Place, I refolv'd to pitch my Tent. This Plain was
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about
twice as long, and lay like a Green before my
Door, and at the End of it descended irregularly
every way down into the low Grounds by the Sea-
side. It was on the N. N. W. side of the Hill, so
that it was shelter'd from the Heat every Day, till
it came to a VV. and by S. Sun, or thereabouts,
which in those Countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my Tent, I drew a half Circle
before the hollow Place, which took in about ten
Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Rock, and
twenty Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning
and Ending.
In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of strong
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till they stood
very firm like Piles, the biggest End being out of
the Ground about five Foot and a half, and shar-
pen' d on the Top; the two Rows did not stand
above six Inches from one another.
Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had
cut in the Ship, and laid them in Rows upon one
another, within the Circle between these two Rows
of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other Stakes in
the Inside, leaning against them, about two Foot
and a half high, like a Spur to a Post, and this
Fence was so strong, that neither Man or Beast
could get into it or over it. This cost me a great
deal of Time and Labour, especially to cut the
Piles in the Woods, bring them to the Place, and
drive them into the Earth.
The Entrance into this Place I made to be, not
by a Door, but by a short Ladder, to* go over
the
3
the Top, which Ladder, when I was in, I listed
over after me, and so I was compleatly senced in,
and fortify'd, as 1 thought, from all the World,
and consequently slept secure in the Night, which
otherwise I could not have done, tho', as it appear'd
afterward, there was no need of all this Caution
from the Enemies I apprehended Danger from.
Into this Fence,or Fortress,with infinite Labour,
I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provisions, Am-
munition and Stores, of which you have the Ac-
count above, and I made me a large Tent, which
to preserve me from the Rains, that in one Part of
the Year are very violent there, I made double,viz,.
one smaller Tent within, and one larger Tent above
it, and cover'd the uppermost with a large Tar-
paulin which 1 had sav'd among the Sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed
which I had brought on Shore, but in a Hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belong'd
to the Mate of the Ship.
Into this Tent 1 brought all my Provisions, and
every Thing that would spoil by the Wet; and ha-
ying thus enclos'd all my Good, I made up the
Entrance, which till now I had left open, and so
pass'd and repass'd, as I said, by a short Ladder.
, WhenT had done this, I began to work my Way,
ffltd the Rock, and bringing all the Earth and
Stones that I dug down, out thro' my Tent, I
"ji them up within my Fence in the Nature of a
Terrace, so that it rais'd the Ground within about
» Foot and a Half; and thus I made a Cave just
behind my Tent, which serv'd 'me like a Cellar to,
ffly House.
It cost me much Labour, and many Days, before
alt these Things were brought to Persection, and
therefore I must go back to some otherThings which
took up some of my Thoughts. Ac the sameTime it
'F 3 happens
happen'd after I had laid my Scheme for the set-
ting up my Tent, and making the Cave, that a
Storm of Rain falling from a thick dark Cloud, a
sudden Flash of Lightning happen'd, and after that,
a great Clap ot Thunder, as is naturally the Essect
of it: I was not so much surpriz'd with the Light-
ning, as I was with a Thought which darted into
my Mind as swift as the Lightning it self: O my
Powder! my very Heart sunk within me, when \
thought, that at one Blast all my Powder might
be destroy'd; on which, not my Desence only, but
the providing me Food, as I thought, entirely de-
pended; I was nothing near so anxious about my
own Danger, tho' had the Powder took Fire, I had
never known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that
after the Storm was over, I laid aside all my Works,
my Building and Fortifying, and apply'd my self
to make Bags and Boxes to separate the Powder,
and to keep it a little and a little in a Parcel, in
hope, that whatever might come, it might not
all take Fire at once, and to keep it so apart, that
it should not be possible to make one part fire
another. I finish'd this Work in about a Fortnight,
and I think my Powder, which in all was about
140 Ib. Wt. was divided in not less than a hun-
dred Parcels. As to the Barrel that had been wet,
I did not apprehend any Danger from that, so I
plac'd it in my new Cave, which in my Fancy I
call'd my Kitchin; and the rest I hid up and
down in Holes among the Rocks, so that no Wet
might come to it, marking very carefully where I
laid it.
In the interval of Time while this was doing, I
-went out at least once every day with my Gun, as
well to divert my self, as to see if I could, kill any
thing fit for Food, and as near as I could, to ac-
quaint
quaint myself with what the Island produc'd. The
first Time I went out, 1 presently discover'd that
there were Goats in the Island, which was a great
Satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with
this Misfortune to me, viz,. That they were so
toy, so subtle, and so swift of Foot, that it was the
difficultest Thing in the World to come at them:
But 1 was not discourag'd at this, not doubting
but 1 might now and then shoot one, as it soon hap-
pen'd; tor after I had sound their Haunts a little,
1 laid wait in this Manner for them : I observ'd, if
they saw me in the Valleys, tho' they were upon
the Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
Fright; but if they were seeding in the Valleys,
and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice
of me; from whence I concluded, that by the
Position of their Opticks, their Sight was so di-
rected downward, that they did not readily see
Objects that were above them: so afterwards I
took this Method, I always climb'd the Rocks first,
to get above them, and then had frequently a faic
Mark. The first Shot I made among these Crea-
tes, I kill'd a She-Goat which had a little Kid'
by her which she gave Suck to, which grieved me
heartily; but when the Old. one sell, the Kid
stood Stock still by her till I came and took her up;
and not only so, but when I carried the Old one
with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid follow'd me
quite to my Enclosure; upon which 1 laid down
the Dam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and car-
ried it over my Pale, in Hopes to have bred it up
tame, but it would not eat, so I was fore'd to
kill it and eat it my self; these two supply'd me
with Fle(h a great while, for I eat sparingly; and
»v d my Provisions (my Bread especially) as much
as possibly I could.
F 4 Having
Having now fix'd my Habitation, I found it
absolutely necessary to provide a Place to make a
Fire in, and Fuel to burn; and what I did for
that, as also how I enlarg'd my, Cave, and what
Conveniences I made, I. shall give a full Account
of it in its Place : But I must first give some little
Account of my self, and of my Thoughts about
Living, which it may well be suppos'd were not
a sew.
I had a dismal Prospect of my Condition ; for as
I was not cast away upon that Island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent Storm quite out of
the Course of our intended Voyage, and a. great
Way, viz,, some Hundreds of Leagues out of the
ordinary Course os the Trade of Mankind, I had
great Reason to consider.it as a Determination of
Heaven, that in this desolate Place, a«d in this
desolate Manner I should end my Lise: the Teats
would run plentifully down my Face when I made
these Reslections, and sometimes I would expostu-
late with my self, Why Providence should thus
compleatly ruin its Creatures, and render them so
absolutely miserable, so without Help abandon'd,
so entirely depress'd, that it could hardly be ra-
tional to be thankful for such a Lise.
But something always, retum'd swift upon me to
check these Thoughts, and to reprove me ; and
particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my
Hand by the Sea-side, I was very pensive upon the
Subject of my present Condition, when Reason, as
it were expostulating with me to'ther Way, thus:
Well, you are in a desolate Condition 'tis true, but
pray remember, where are the rest of you? Did
not you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where
are the Ten? Why were not they sav'd, and you
lost ? Why were you singled out? Is it better to be
here or there? and then I pointed to the Sea. All
Evils
Evils are to be consider'd with the Good that is in
them, and with what worse attended them.
Then it occur'd to me again, how well I was
furnisiVd for my Subsistence, and what would have
been my Case if it had not happen'd, Whkh was
at HundredThmsand to One, that the Ship sloated
from the Place were she first struck, and was dri-
xen so near to the Shore that I had time to gee
48 these things out of her: What would have
been my Case, if I had been to have liv'd in the
Condition in which I at first came on Shore, with-
out Necessaries of Lise, or Necessaries to supply
and procure them? Particularly said I aloud, (tho'
to my self) what should I ha' done without a
Gun, without Ammunition, without any Tools
to make any thing, or, to work with, without
Gloaths, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of
Corerings ; and that now I had all these to a suffi-
cient Quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
my sen in such a manner, as to live without my
Gun when my Ammunition was spent? So that
I had a tolerable View of subsisting without any
Want as long as I liv'd ; for I consider'd from the
Beginning how I would provide for the Accidents
that might happen, and for the Time that was to
come, even not only aftet my Ammunition should
be spent, but even after my Health or Strength
firould decay.
I consess I had not entertain'd any Notion of my
Ammunition being destroy'd at one Blast, I mean
my Powder being blown up by Lightning, and this
made the Thoughts of it so surprizing to me when
K 1'ghten'd and thunder'd, as I observ'd just now.
And now being to enter into a melancholy
Elation of a Scene of silent Lise, such perhaps as
w« never heard of in the World before, I shall
take it from its Beginning, and continue it m its
Order
Order. It was, by my Account, the 30th of Sep-
tember, when, in the manner as abovesaid, 1 first set
Foot upon this horrid Island, when the Sun being,
to us, in its Autumnal Equinox, was almost just
over my Head, for I reckon'd my self, by Obser-
vation, to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees 22 Mi-
nutes North of the Line.
After I had been there about Ten or Twelve
Days it came into my Thoughts, that I should lose
my Reckoning of Time for want of Books, and
Pen and Ink, and should even forget the Sabbath
pays from the working Days: But to prevent this,
I cut it with my Knise upon a large Post, in Ca-
pital Letters, and making it into' a great Cross, I
set it up on the Shore where I first landed, viz,. I
tfime on Shore here the $oth of Sept. 1659. Upon
the Sides of this square Post, I cut every Day a
Notch with my Knise, and every seventh Notch
was as long again as the rest, and every first Day
of the Month as long again as that long one ; and
thus 1 kept my Kalendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly Reckoning of Time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought off the Ship in
the several Voyages, which, as abovemention'd,
I made to it, I got several things of less value,
but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted set-
ting down before; as in particular, Pens, Ink, and
Paper, several Parcels in the Captain's Mate's,
Gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or. four -
Compasses, some Mathematical Instruments, Dials^,
Perspectives, Charts, and Books of Navigation,'
all which I huddled together, whether I might
want them orno; also I found three very good
Bibles, which came to me in my Cargo from Eng-
land, and which I had pack'd up among my things;
some Portuguese Books also, and among them two
or
or three Popish Prayer-Books, and several othec
Book, all which I carefully secur'd. And 1 must
not forget that we had in the Ship a Dog and two
Cats, of whose eminent History I may have occa-
sion to fay something in its Place; for I carry'd
both the Cats with me; and as for the Dog, he
jump'd out of the Ship of himself, and swam on
Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore with
my sirst Cargo, and was a trusty Servant to me
many Years : I wanted nothing that he could setch
me, nor any Company that he could make up to
pe; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but
that would not do. As 1 observ'd before, I found
Pen, Ink and Paper, and I husbanded them to the
utmost; and 1 shall shew, that while my Ink lasted,
I kept things very exact; but after that was gone,
I could not; for I could not make any Ink, by any
Means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amass'd to-
gether; and of these, this of Ink was one, as also
Spade, Pick-Axe and Shovel, to dig or remove
the Earth; Needles, Pins and Thread; as for
Linnen I soon learn'd to want that without much
Difficulty.
This Wane of Tools made every Work I did go
on heavily, and it was near a whole Year before I
hid entirely finished my little Pale, or surrounded
Habitation: The Piles, or Stakes, which were as
heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cut-
tmg and preparing in the Woods, and more by far
in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two
Days in cutting and bringing home one of those
Posts, and a third Day in driving it into the Ground:
for which purpose I got a heavy Piece of Wood
V first, but at last bethought my self of one of the
won Crows, which however, tho' I found it, yet
it made driving those Posts or Piles very laborious
and tedious Work.
But what need I ha' been concerned at the Te-
diousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other Em-
ployment if that had been over, at least, that I
could foresee, except the ranging the Island to seek
for Food, which i did more or less every Day.
1 now began to consider seriously my Condition*
and the Circumstance I was reduc'd to; and 1 drew
up the State of my Asfairs in Writing, not so much
to leave them to any that were to come after me,
for I was like to have but sew Heirs, as to de-
liver my Thoughts from daily poring upon them,
and afflicting my Mind; and as my Reason began
now to master my Despondency, 1 began to com-
fort my self as well as I could, and to set the Good
against the Evil, that I might have something to
distinguish my Case from worse; and I stated it
very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the
Comforts I enjoy'd, against the Miseries I sussei'd,
thus:

I could hardly wear them.
I am without any De-

Violence of Man or Beast.
I have no Soul to speak
to, or relieve me.
But I am cast on ait l-
fland, where I see no wild
Beasts to hurt me, as Isavi
on the Coast of Africa:
And what if I had been
Shipwreck'd there?
But God wonderfully
sent the Ship in near enough
to the Shore, that I have
gotten out so many necessary
Things as will either sup-
ply my Wants, or enable me
to supply myself, even at
long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Testi-
mony, that there was scarce any Condition in the
World so miserable, but there was something ne-
gative ot something positive to be thankful for in it;
and let this stand as a Direction from the Expe-
rience of the most miserable of all Conditions in
this World, that we may always find in it some-
thing to comfort ourselves from, and to set in the
Description of Good and Evil, on the Credit side
of the Account.
Having now brought my Mind a little to relislx
*y Condition, and given over looking but to Sea,
* see if I could spy a Ship; I say, giving ovee
"Kse things, I began to apply myself to accom-
modate my way of Living, and to make things as
Wy to me as 1 could.
I have
I have already described my Habitation, which
was a Tent under the side of a Rock, surrounded
with a strong Pale of Posts and Cables, but 1 might
now rather call it a Wall; for I raised a kind of
Wall up against it of Turfs, about two Foot thick
on the Outside; and after some time, (I think it
was a Year and half) 1 raised Rafters from it, lean-
ing to the Rock, and thatch'd or cover'd it with
Boughs of Trees, and such things as 1 could get,
to keep out the Rain, which 1 found at some times
of the Year very violent.
1 have already observ'd how I brought all my
Goods into this Pale, and into the Cave which I
had made behind me:. But I must obsctve too,
that at first this was a confused Heap of Goods,
which as they lay in no Order, so they took up
all my Place, 1 had no room to turn myself; so
I set myself to enlarge my Cave and Works far-
ther into the Earth; for it was a loose sandy
Rock, which yielded easily to the Labour I be-
stowed on it: And so when I sound I was pretty
sase as to Beasts of Prey, I work'd sideways to the
Right Hand into the Rock; and then turning to
the Right again, work'd quite out, and made me
a Door to come out on the Outside of my Pale
or Fortisication.
This gave me not only Egress and Regress, as it
were a Back Way to my Tent, and to my Store-
house, but gave me room to stow my Goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a Chair and a Table; for without these I was
not able to en;oy the sew Comforts I had in the
World; I could not write or eat, or several things,
with so much Pleasure without a Table.
So 1 went to work: and here I must needs 6b-
serve, that as Reason is the Substance and Origi-
nal
nal of the Mathematicks, so by stating and squa-
ring every thing by Reason, and by making the
most rational Judgment of things, every Man may
be in time Master of every Mechanick Art. I had,
never handled a Tool in my Lise, and yet in lime
by Labour, Application and Contrivance, I found
at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made
it, especially if I had had Tools; however, I made
abundance of things even without Tools, and
some with no more Tools than an Adisc and
a Hatchet, which perhaps were never made that
way before, and that with infinite Labour. Foe
Example, If I wanted a Board, I had no other
way but to, cut down a Tree, set it on an edge
before me, and hew it -slat on either Side with my
Axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a Plank,
and then dubb it smooth with my Adise. It is
true, by this Method I could make but one Board
out of a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy
for but Patience, any more than 1 had for the pro-
digious deal of Time and Labour which it took
me up to make a Plank or Board: But my Time
or Labour was little worth, and so it was as well
employ'd one way as another.
However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as
Iobscrv'd above, in the first Place, and this I did
out of the short Pieces of Boards that I brought on
my Raft from the Ship : But when I had wrought
out some Boards, as above, I made large Shelves
of the breadth of a Foot and a half, one over an-
other, all along one side of my Cave, to lay all my
Tools, Nails and Iron-work, and in a Word, to se-
parate every thing at large in their Places, that I
. might easily come at them; I knock'd Pieces into
hk Wall of the Rock to hang roy Guns, and all
wmgs that would hang up.

So that had my Cave been to be seen, it look'd
like a general Magazine of all necessary things; and
I had every thing so ready at my Hand, that it
was a great Pleasure to me to see all my Goods in
fi;ch Order, and especially to find my Stock of all
Necessaries so great.
And now it was when I began to keep a Jour-
nal of every Day's Employment, for indeed at first
I was in too much a Hurry, and not only Hurry
las to Labour, but in too much Discomposure of
Wind, and my Journal would ha' been full of many
dull things. For Example, I must have said thus:
Sept. the 30th. After I got to Shore, and had escap'd
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my
Deliverance, having first vomited with the great
Quantity of salt Water which was gotten into my
Stomach, and recovering my self a little, I ran
about the Shore, wringing my Hands and beating
my Head and Face, exclaiming at my Misery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone, till tir'd
and faint, I was forc'd to lye down on the Ground
to Repose, but durst not sleep for sear of being de-
voured.
Some Days after this, and after I had been on
board the Ship, I got all that I could out of
Jier, yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top
of a little Mountain, and looking out to Sea, in
dopes of seeing a Ship, then fancy at a vast Di-
stance I spy'd a Sail, please my self with the Hopes
of it, and then after looking steadily till I was al-
most blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep
like a Child, and thus encreasc my Misery by my
Folly.
But having gotten over these things in some mea-
sure, and having settlest my Houshold-Stussand Ha-
bitation , made me a Table and a Chair, and all
as handsome about me as I could, I began to keep
my
my Journal, of which I shall here give you the Co-
py, (tho' in it will be tpld all these Particulars over
again) as long as it lasted; for haying np more In]c,
I was forced to leave it off.
The J O U,R N AX«
SEptember 30, 1659. I, pfeor miserable Robinson
Crusoe, being shipwreck'd^during a dreadful
Storm in the Offing, came on shore on this dismal
unfortunate Island, which I call'd the Ijland os De-
spair, all the rest of the Ship's Company being
drown'dj and myself almost dead.
All the rest os the Day I spent in asflicting my
self at the dismal Circumstances I was brought to,
««» I had neither Food, Houle, Cloaths, Wea-
pon, or Place to sly to, and in Despair of any Re-
lief, saw nothing but Death before me, either that
I should be devour'd by wild Beasts, murder'd by
Savages, or starv'd to Death for want of Food.
At the Approach of Night, I slept in a Tree for
fear of wild Creatures, but slept soundly, tho' it
rain'd all Night.
OBober 1. In the Morning I saw, to my great
Surprize, the Ship had sloated with the high Tide,
and was driven on shore again much nearer the
Mand, which, as it was some Comfort on one hand,
(for feeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces,
1 "oped, if the Wind abated, I might get on board,
and get some Food and Necessaries out of her for
my Relief) so on the other hand, it renew'd my
««f at the Loss of my Comrades, who, I ima-
gined, if we had all staid on board, might have
jived the Ship, or at least that they would not have
oeen all drown'd as they were; and that had the
Men been saved, we might perhaps have built us
a Bpat out of the Ruins of the Ship, to have car-
Part I. q N ried,
...' C 8i ]
ried us to some other Part of the World. I spent
great Part of this Day in perplexing myself on
these things; but at length seeing the Ship almost
dry, I went upon the Sand as neap as I could, and
then swam on board: This Day also continued
raining, tho* with no Wind at all.
From the ist of Olhber to the 24th. All these
Days entirely spent in many several Voyages to
get all I could out of the Ship, which I brought
on shore every Tide of Flood upon Rafts. Much
Rain also in these Days, tho' with some Intervals
of fair Weather: But, it seems, this was the rainy
Season. . -
Oct. 20. I overset my Raft, and all the Goods
I had got upon it; but being in shoal Water, and
the things being chiesly heavy, I recover'd many
of them when the Tide was out.
OB. 25. It rain'd all Night and all Day, with
some Gusts of Wind, during which Time the Ship
broke in Pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be seen, except
the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water. I
spent this Day in covering and securing the Goods
which I had saved, that the Rain might not spoil
them.
OB.%6: I walk'd about the Shore almost all Day
to find out a Place to fix my Habitation, greatly
concern'd to secure myself from any Attack in the
Night, either from wild Beasts or Men. Towards
Night I fix'd upon a proper Place under a Rock,
and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my Encampment,
which I resolv'd to strengthen with a Work, Wall,
or Fortisication, made of double Piles, lined with-
in with Cable, and without with Turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I work'd very hard
in carrying all my Goods to my new Habitation,
tho'
tho' some Part of the 1 ime it rain'd exceeding
hard.
The 3 ill in the Morning I went out into the
Island with my Gun to see for some Food, and dis-
cover the Country, when 1 kill'd a She-Goat, and
her Kid sollow'd me Home, which 1 afterwards
kill'd also, because it would not seed.
November i. I setup my Tent under a Rock, and
lay there for the first Night, making it as large as
1 could with Stakes driving in to swing my Ham-
mock upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my Chests and Boards, and
the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and
with them form'd a Fence round me, a little with-
in the Place I had mark'J out for my Fortifica-
tion.
Nov. 3.1 went out with my Gun, and kill'd two
Fowls like Ducks, which were very good Food.
In the Afternoon went to work to make me a
Table.
Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my
Times of Work, of going out with my Gun,Time
w Sleep, and Time of Diversion, fix.. Every
Morning I walk'd out with my Gun for two or
three Hours, if it did not rain, then employ'd my
tell to work till about eleven a Clock, then eat what
J had to live on, and from twelve to two I lay
down to sleep, the Weather being excessive hot,
then in the Evening to work again: The
working Part of this Day and the next were whol-
ly employ'd in making my Table, for 1 was yet
hM avery sorry Workman, tho' Time and Neces-
"ty made me a compleat natural Mechanick soon
"ter, as I believe it would do any one else.
«w. 5- This Day I went abroad with my Gun
»nd my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat, her Skin
P«tty soft, but her Flesh good for nothing: Every
G a Creature
Creature I kill'd, I took off the Skins and preserv'd
them. Coming back by the Sea Shore, 1 saw ma-
ny Sorts of Sea-Fowls which I did not understand;
but was surprized, and almost frighted with two or
three Seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well
knowing what they were, got into the Sea, and
escaped me for that time. ,
Nov. 6. After my Morning Walk, I went to
Work with my Table again, and finished it, tho*
not to my Liking; nor was it long before I learn'd
to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair Wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, pth, 10th, and Part of the
12th (for the nth was Sunday, according to my
Reckoning) I took wholly up to make me a Chair,
and with much ado brought it to a tolerable Shape,
but never to please me; and even in the Making t
pull'd it to Pieces several times. Note, I soon ne-
glected my keeping Sunday; for omitting my Mark
for them on my Post, I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13. This Day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the Earth, but it was ac-
company'd with terrible Thunder and Lightning,
which frighted me dreadfully, for sear of my Pow-
der: As soon as it was over, I resolved to separate
my Stock of Powder into as many little Parcels as
possible, that it might not be in Danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three Days I spent in
making little square Chests or Boxes, which might
hold about a Pound, or two Pound, at most, of
Powder ; and so putting the Powder in, I stowed
it in Places as secure and remote from one another
as possible. On one of these three Days I kill'd a
large Bird that was good to eat, but I know not
what to call it.
Nov. 17. This Day I began to dig behind my
Tent into the Rock, to make room for my farther
Convc-
3
Convenience Note, Three Things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this Work, viz,, a Pick-axe, a Shovel,
and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, so I desisted from
my Work, and began to consider how to supply
that'Want, and make me some Tools. .As for a
Pick-axe, I made use of the Iron Crows, which
were proper enough, tho* heavy; but the next
Thing was a Shovel or Spade; this was so abso-
lutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing
effectually without it; but what kind of one to
make I knew not.
Nov. 18. The next Day in searching the Woods,
I found a Tree of that Wood, or like it, which
in the Brafils they call the Iron Tree, for its ex-
ceeding Hardness of this, with great Labour,
and almost spoiling my Ax, I cut a Piece, and
brought it Home too with Difficulty enough, for
it was exceeding heavy. . .
The excessive Hardness of the Wood, and having
10 other Way, made me a long while upon this
Machine, for I work'd it effectually, by little and
little, into the Form of a Shovel or Spade, the
Handle exactly shap'd like ours in England,- only
that the broad Part having no Iron shod upon it
at Bottom, it would not last me so long ; however
it scrv'd well enough for the Uses which I had
Occasion to put it to; but never was a Shovel,
1 believe, made aftet that Fashion, or so long a
making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a
Whefil-barrow 3 a Basket I could not make by any
means, having no such Things as Twigs that would
bend to make Wicker Ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to the Wheel-barrow, I fancy d I could
make all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion,
of, neithet did I know how to go about it; besides,
I had no possible Way to^ make Iron Gudgeons
for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, so
I gave it over; and so for carrying away the Earth
which I dug out of the Cave, I made me a Thing
like a Hoad which the Labourers carry Mortar in
when they serve the Bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making
the Shovel ; and yet this, and the Shovel, and the
Attempt, which 1 made in vain, to makeaWheel-
barrow, took me up no less than four Days; I mean
always, excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun,
which 1 seldom fail'd, and very seldom fail'd also
of bringing home something fit to eat.
Nov. 23. My other Work having now stood
still, because of my making these Tools; when they
were finish'd, I went on, and working every Day,
as my Strength and Time allow'd, I spent eigh-
teen Days entirely in widening and deepening my
Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodi-
ously.
Note, During all this Time, I work'd to make
this Room or Cave spacious enough to accommo-
date me as a Warehouse or Magazine, a Kitchen,
a Dining-room, and a Cellar as for a Lodging,
I kept to the Tent, except that sometimes in the
wet Season of the Year, it rain'd so hard that I
could not keep my self dry, which caus'd me after-
wards to cover all my Place within my Pale with
long Poles in the form of Rafters, leaning against
the Rock, and load them with Flags, and large
Leavest>f Trees like a Thatch.
Itygfhiher 10. I began now to think my Cave or
Vauit^finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large) a great Quantity of Earth
sell down from the Top and one Side, so much,
that in short it frighted me, and not without Rea-
son too, for if I had been under it, I had never
wanted a Grave-digger: Upon this Disaster I had
a (Treat
a^great deal of Work to do over again; for I had
rhe loose Earth to carry out, and, which was of
more importance, I had the CJeling to prop up, so
that I might be sure no more would come down.
Dec. ii. This Day I went to work with it ac-
cordingly, and got two Shoars or Pqsts pitch'd up-
right to the Jap, .with two Pisces of Boards a-crofs
over each £qsl: this I finished ihp next Day; and
setting more Posts up with Boards, in about a
Week more I had the Roof secured; and the Post's
standing in .Rows,' served me 'for Partitions to pai;t
of my House. '". .
Dec. 17. From this Day to the 20th, I placed
Shelves, and knock'd up Nails^on the Posts to hang
every thing up * that could be hung up; anc* "~"7'
began to be in some Order ^kbin Ppogk.;... . .
Dec. 20. Now I carried every .thing' into the
Cave, and began to furnish my House, and set up
some Pieces pf Boards like a$ceffer, to order my
Victuals upon; but'Boards began to be very, scares
with me: AlsoT.made me.anbther T~Mf£ . ,'.'[ i

Dec. ,25. .Rain all Day.' . J
Dec.26. No Rain, and.tbe^atth .much cooler

Dec. 27. Kill'd a young Goat, and lam'd ano-
ther, so that I catch'd it, ,and led it Home in a
^ring; when 1 had it Home, Xbound and splin-
ter'd up its Leg which was broke. N. &t I took
such care of.it that it lived, 'and the Leg^rew
w«ll, and as strong as ever; but by^nursing it so
'ong ic grew tame, and sed upon the little Green
,at my iDoor, and .would ,not go away. This
was the first-time that I entertained a Thought
os breeding up some tame Creatures, that I
G 4 'might
might have Food when my Powder and Shot was
all spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the
Evening for Food: this Time I spent in putting
all my Things in Order within Doors.
January 1. Very hot still, but I Went abroad ear-
ly and late with my Gun, and lay still in the middle
of the Day s This Evening going farther into the
Valleys, which lay towards the Center of the Island,
I fouhd there was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding
sliie and hard to come at; however, I resolv'd to try
if I could not bring my Dog to huht them down.
Jan. i. Accordingly, the next Day I went out
with my Dog, and set him upon the Gdats; but I
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the
Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he
would not come neat them.
Jan. 3. I began ihy Fence or Wall, which, be-
ing still jealous of my beingattack'd by somebody,
J resolv'd to make very thick and strong.
N.B. This Wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit -what -was said in the Journal ..
it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less
Time than from the 3d of January to the
14th of April, working, finijhing and per-
fecting this Wall, tho' it was no more than
about 24 Yards in length, being a half Circle
'. from one Place in the Rock to another Place
about eight Yards from it, the DoOr of the
Cave being in the Center behind it.
All this time I work'd very hard, the Rains
hindering me many Days, nay, sometimes Weeks
together; but I thought I should never be per-
sectly secure till this Wall was finish'd; and it is
scarce credible what inexpressible Labour every
thing was done with, especially the bringing Piles
out of the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground; for I made them much bigger than I
needed to have done.
When this Wall was finisiVd, and the Outside
double senced with a Turf-Wall raised up close to
it, I perswaded myself, that if any People were to
come on fliore there, they would not perceive
any thing like a Habitation : and it was very well
I did so, as may be observ'd hereafter, upon a very
remarkable Occasion.
During this time, I made my Rounds in the
Woods for Game every Day when the Rain ad-
mitted me, and made frequent Discoveries in these
Walks of something or other to my Advantage;
particularly I found a kind of ,wild Pidgeons, who
built not as Wood-Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather
as House-Pidgeons, in the Holes of the Rocks;
and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up tame, and did so; but when they
grew older, they slew all away,, which perhaps
was at first for want of seeding them, for I had no-
thing to give them; however, I frequently found
their Nests, and got their young ones, which were
very good Meat.
And now in the managing my Houshold Asfairs,
I found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at first it was impossible for me to make,
8s indeed as to some of them it was; for Instance,
I could never make a Cask to be hoop'd; I had a
small Runlet or two, as I observ'd before, but I
could never arrive to the Capacity of [making one
by them, tho' I spent many Weeks about it; I
could neither put in the Heads, or join the Staves
so true to one another, as to make them hold Wa->
ter; so I gave that also over. ..' . T^
In the next place, I was at a great loss for Can-
dle; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which
was generally by Seven o' Clock, I was obliged to
go to Bed. I remember the Lump of Bees-Wax,
with which I made Candles in my African Adven-
ture; but I had none of that now: the only Re-
medy I had was, that when I had kill'd a Goat,
I saved the Tallow, and with a little Dish made
of Clay, which I baked in the Sun, to which I
added a Wick of some Oakum, I made me a
Lamp; and this gave me Light, tho' not a clear
steady Light like a Candle. In the middle of all
my Labours it happen'd, that rummaging my
Things, I found a little Bag, which, as I hinted
before, had been fill'd with Corn for the seeding
of Poultry, not for this Voyage, but before, as I
suppose, when the Ship came from Lisbon; what
little Remainder of Corn had been in the Bag,
was all devour'd with the Rats, and I saw nothing
in the Bag but Husks and Pust; and being willing
to have the Bag for some other Use, (I think it was
to put Powder in, when I divided it for sear of
-the Lightning, or some such Use,) I shook the
iHusks of Corn out of it on one side of my Forti-
fication under the Rock.
It was a little before the great Rains, just now
mention'd, that I threw this Stuff away, taking no
notice of any thing, and not so much as remem-
bring that I had thrown any thing there^ when
about a Month after, or thereabouts, i saw-some
sew Stalks of something green shooting out of the
.Ground, which I fancied might be some Plant ;I
had not seen; but I was surprized and persectly
astonish'd, when after a little longer time I saw
about ten or twelve Ears come out, which we^e
persect green Barley of the fame &iqd. as our;i&»-
refean, nay, as our Englijh Barley.
It is impossible to express the Astonishment and
Confusion of my Thoughts on this Occasion; I
had hitherto acted upon no religious Foundation ac
all; indeed I had very sew Notions of Religion in
my Head, nor had entertain'd any Sense of any
Thing that had befallen me, otherwise than as a
Chance, or, as we lightly fay, what pleases God;
without so much as enquiring into the End of Pro-
vidence in these Things, or his Order in govern-
ing Events in the World: But after I saw Barley
grow there, in a Climate which I knew was not
proper for Corn, and especially that I knew not
how it came there, it startled me strangely, and I
began to suggest, that God had miraculously caus'd
this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed sown,
and that it was so directed purely for my Suste-
nance on that wild miserable Place.
This touch'd my Heart a little, and brought
Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to bless my
self, that such a Prodigy of Nature should happen
upon my Account; and this was the more strange
to me, because I saw near it still all along by the
Side of the Rock, some other straggling Stalks,
which prov'd to be Stalks of Rice, and which I
knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa when
I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure Productions
ot Providence for my Support, but not doubting,
but that there was more in the Place, I went all
over that Part of the Island, where I had been
before, peering in every Corner, and under every
Rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find
any; at last it occur'd to my Thoughts, that I had
slwok a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place,
and then the Wonder began to cease ; and I must
confess, my religious Thankfulness to God's Pro-
vidence began to abate too upon the discover-
ing
ring that all this was nothing but what was com-
mon; tho' I ought to have been as thankful for so
strange and unforeseen Providence, as if it had
been miraculous; for it was really the Work of
Providence as to me, that should order or appoint,
that 10 or 12 Grains of Corn should remain un-
spoil'd (when the Rats had destroy'd all the rest)
as if it had been dropt from Heaven : As also that I
should thiow it out in that particular Place where,
it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it sprang up
immediately,; whereas, if I had thrown it any
where else at that Time, it had been burnt up and
destroy'd.
I carefully fav'd the Ears of this Corn, you maybe
sure in their Season, which was about the End of
and laying up every Corn, I resolv'd to sow
them all again, hoping in Time to have some
Quantity sufficient to supply me with Bread; but
it was not till the 4th Year that I could allow my
self the least Grain of this Corn to eat, and even
then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its
Order; for I lost all that I sow'd the first Season,
by not observing the proper Time, for I sow'd it
just before the dry Season, so that it never came
vp at all, at least, not as it would have done : Of
which in its Place.
Besides this Barley, there was, as above, 26 or
30 Stalks of Rice, which I prescrv'd with the fame
Care, and whose Use was of the fame Kind, or to
the fame Purpose, (viz,.) to make me Bread, or
rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up with-
out baking, tho' I did that also after some Time.
But to return to my Journal.
I work'd excessive hard this three or four
Months, to get my Wall done ; and the 14th of
April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not
by a Door, but over the Wall by a Ladder, that
ther&
there might be no Sign on the Outside of my
Habitation.
April 16.1 finish'd the Ladder, so I went up with
the Ladder to the Top, and then pull'd it up as',
ter me, and let it down on the Inside : This was a
compleat Enclosure to me; for within I had room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unless it could first mount my Wall.
The very next Day after this Wall was finish'd,
I had almost had all my Labour overthrown at
once, and my self kill'd ; the Case was thus: As I
was busy in the Inside of it,, behind my Tent, just
in the Entrance' into my Cave, I was terribly fright-
ed with a most dreadful surprizing thing indeed;
for all on a sudden I found the Earth came crum-
bling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from
the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of
the Posts I had set up in the Cave, crack'd in a
frightful manner: I was heartily scared, but thought
nothing of what really was the Cause, only think-
ing that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as some
of it had done before; and for sear I should be bu-
ried in it, I ran forward to my Ladder, and not
thinking my self sase there neither, I got over my
Wall for sear of the Pieces of the Hill which I ex-
pected might roll down upon me. I was no sooner
stept down upon the firm Ground, but I plainly
saw it was a terrible Earthquake, for the(Ground
I stood on shook three times, at about eight Mi-
nutes Distance, with three such Shocks as would
have overturned the strongest Building that could
be supposed to have stood on the Earth; and a
great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which stood
about Half a Mile from me next the Sea, fell down
with such a terrible Noise, as I never heard in all
my Lise. I perceived also, the very Sea was put
into a violent Motion by it; and I believe the
Shock
Shocks were stronger under the Water than on the
Island.
I was so amaz'd with the Thing it self, having
never selt the like, or discours'd with any one that
had, that I was like one dead or stupify'd ; and the
Motion of the Earth made my Stomach sick, like
one that was toss'd at Sea; but the Noise os the
falling of the Rock awaked me, as it were, and rou-
zing me from the stupisied Condition 1 was in,
fill'd me with Horror, and I thought of nothing
then but the Hill falling upon my Tent, and all my
Houshold Goods, and burying all at once; and
this sunck my very Soul within me a second time.
After the third Shock was over, and I selt no
more for some Time, I began to take Courage, and
yet I had not Heart enough to get over myWall a-
gain, for sear of being buried alive, but fat still
upon the Ground, greatly cast down and-disconso-
late, not knowing what to do: All this while I had
not the least serious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord ha Mercy uf on mt; and
when it was over, that went away too.
While I fat thus, I found the Air over cast, and
grew cloudy, as if it would rain; so that in less
than half an Hour it blew a most dreadful Hurri-
cane: The Sea was all on a sudden cover'd over
with Foam and Froth, the Shore was cover'd with
the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up
by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was; and
this held about three Hours, and then began to
abate and then in two Hours more it was calm, and
began to rain very hard.
All this while I fat upon the Ground very much
terrify'd and dejected, when on a sudden it came
into my Thoughts, that theseWinds and Rain being
the Consequence of the Earthquake, the Earthquake
itself
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my Cave again. With this Thought my Spirits
began to revive, and the Rain helping also to per-
fwade me, 1 went in and fat down in my Tent;
but the Rain was so violent, that my Tent was
ready to be beaten down with it, and I was forced
to go into my Cave, tho' very much afraid and un-
easy, for sear it should fall on my Head.
This violent Rain forced me to a new Work,
viz,, to cut a Hole thro' my new Fortisication like
a Sink to let Water go out, which would else have
drown'd my Cave. After I had been in my Cave
some time, and found- still no more Shocks of the
Earthquake follow, I began to be more composed;
and now, to support my Spirits, . which indeed
wanted it very much, 1 went to my little Store,
and took a small ,sup of Rum, which however I
did then and always very sparingly, knowing I
could have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that Night, and great
Part of the next Day, so that I could not stir a-
hroad; but my Mind being more composed, I
began to think of what I had best do, conclud-
ing, that if the Istand was subject to these Earth-
quakes, there would be no living for me in a Cave,
hut I must consider of building me some little Hut
in an open Place, which I might surround with a
Wall, as I had done here, and so make myself se-
cure from wild Beasts or Men; but concluded, if
1 staid where I was, I should certainly, one time
ot other, be buried alive.
With these Thoughts I resolv'd to remove my
Tent from the Place where it stood, which was
just under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and
which, if it should be shaken again, would certain-
ty fill upon my Tent: And 1 spent the two next
r 1 Day*
Days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in con-
triving where and how to remove my Habitation.
The Fear of being swallow'd up alii e, made me
that I never slept in quiet; and yet the Apprehen-
sion of lying abroad without any Fence, was al-
most equal to it: But still, when 1 look'd about,
and saw how every thing was put in Order, how
pleasantly conceal'd I was, and how sase from
Danger, it made me very loth to remove.
In the mean time it occurr'd to me, that it would
require a vast deal of Time for me to do this, and
that I must be contented to run the Venture where
I was, till I had form'd a Camp for myself, and
had secured it so as to remove to it: So with this
Resolution I composed myself for a Time, and re-
solv'd that I would go to work with all speed to
build me a Wall with Piles and Cables, &c. in a
Circle, as before, and set my Tent up in it when
it was finish'd, but that I would venture to stay
where I was, till it was finish'd and fit to remove to.
This was the 21st.
April 2i. The next Morning I began to consider
of Means to put this Resolve in execution; but I
was at a great Loss about my Tools: I had three
large Axes, and abundance of Hatchets, ( for we
carry'd the Hatchets for Trasfic with the Indians)
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
Wood, they were all full of Notches, and dull;
and tho' I had a Grindstone, I could not turn it and
grind my Tools too: this cost me as much Thought
as a Statesman would have bestow'd upon a grand
Point of Politicks, or a Judge upon the Lise and
Death of a Man. At length I contrived a Wheel
with a String, to turn it with my Foot, that I
might have both my Hands at Liberty. Note, I
had not seen any such Thing in England, or at least
not to take Notice how it was done, tho' since I
have
have observed, it is very common there; besides
that, my Grindstone was very large and heavy.
This Machine cost me a full Week's Work to bring
it to Persection.
Afril 28, 2p. These two whole Days I took up
in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turning my
Grindstone performing very well.
sipril 30. Having perceived my Bread had been,
low a great while, I now took a Survey of it, and
reduced myself to one Bisket-cake a Day, which
made my Heart very heavy.
- Maj 1. In the Morning looking towards the
Sea-side, the Tide being low, I saw something lie
on the Shore bigger than ordinary, and it iook'd
like a Cask; when I came to it, I found a small
Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of
the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the lare
Hurricane, and looking towards the Wreck itself,
I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the Water
than it used to do; I examined the Barrel which
was driven on Shore, and soon found it was a
Barrel of Gunpowder, but it had taken Water, and
the Powder was caked as hard as a Stone: How-
ever, I roll'd it farther on Shore for the present, and
went on upon the Sands, as near as I could to the
wreck of the Ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the Ship 1 found it strange-
ly removed: The Forecastle, which lay before bu-
ried in Sand, was heav'd up at least six Foot, and
™e Stern, which was broke to pieces, and parted
•torn the rest by the Force of the Sea, soon after
"ad left rummaging of her, was toss'd as it were
I «P, and cast on one Side, and the Sand was thrown
10 high on that Side next her Stern, that whereas
there was a great Piace of Water before, so that I
fould not come within a Quarter of a Mile of the
wreck without swimming, I could now walk
Part V H quite
quite up to her when the Tide was out. I was su^
prized with this at first:, but soon concluded it must
be done by the Earthquake; and as by this Vio-
lence the Ship was more broken open than former-
ly, so many things came daily on shore which the
Sea had loosen'dj and which the Winds and Water
roll'd by degrees to the Land.
This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the
Design of removing my Habitation; and I busied
myself mightily that Day especially, in searching
whether I could make any way into the Ship, but
I sound nothing was to be expected of that kind,
for that all the inside of the Ship was choak'd up'
with Sand: However, as I had learnt not to de-
spair of any thing, I resolv'd to pull every thing;
to pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding that
every thing I could get from her would be of some
Use or other to me.
May 3. I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece
of a Beam thro', which I thought held some of
the upper Part, or Quarter-Deck, together, and
when I had cut it thro', I clear'd away the Sand
as well as I could, from the Side which lay highest;
but the Tide coming in, I was obliged to give over
for that time.
May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not oneFish
that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my Sport,
when just going to leave osf, I caught a young Dol-
phin. I had made me a long Line of some Rope-
Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently caught
Fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which
I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them dry.
May y. Work'd on the Wreck, cut anothet
Beam asunder, and brought three great Fir Planks
off from the Decks, which I tied together, and
- made swim on shore when the Tide of Flood
came on.
May
May 6. Work'd on the Wreck, got several Iron
Bolts out of her, and other Pieces of Iron Work,
work'd very hard, and came home very much tir'd,
and had Thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an
Intent not to work, but found the V/eight of the
Wreck had broke itself down, the Beams being cut,
that several Pieces of the Ship seem'd to lye loose,
and the Inside of the Hold lay so open, that I
could see into it, but almost full of Water and Sand.
May 8. Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an Iron
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now
quite cleat of the Water or Sand; I wrench'd open
two Planks, and brought them on Shore also with
the Tide: I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for
next Day., . .
May 9. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow
made Way into the Body of the Wreck, and selt
several Casks, and loosen'd them with the Crow,
but could not break them up ; I selt also the Roll
of Englijh Lead, and could slir it, but it was too
wavy to move. '..
May 10, ii, 12, 13, 14. Went every Day to
the Wreck, and got a great deal of Pieces of Tim-
ber and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or 300 Weight
of Iron.
Maj 15. I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I
could not cut a Piece osf of the Roll of Lead, by
Placing the Edge -of one Hatchet, and driving it
with the other; but as it lay about a Foot and a
half in the Water, I could not make any Blow to
drive the Hatchet.
May 16. It had blow'd hard in the Night, and
the Wreck appear'd more broken by the Force of
the Water ; but I stay'd so long in theWoods to gee
ridgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented me
going to the Wreck that Day.
h 1 May
May 17. I saw some pieces of the Wreck blown
on Shore, at a great Distance, two Miles off me,
but resolv'd to see what they were, and found it
was a piece of the Head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24. Every Day to this Day I work'd on
the Wreck, and with hard Labour I loosen'd some
things so much with the Crow, that the first blow-
ing Tide several Casks sloated out, and two of the
Seamen's Chests ; but the Wind blowing from the
Shore, nothing came to Land that Day, but pieces
of Timber, and a Hogshead which had some Bra-
z,il Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand had
spoil'd it.
I continued this Work every Day to the 15 th of
'June, except the time necessary to get Food,
which I always appointed, during this Part of my
Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that I
might be ready when it was ebb'd out, and by this
Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron-
Work enough to have built a good Boat, if I
bad known how; and also I got at several timesi
and in several Pieces, near 100 Weight of the Sheet-
Lead.
June j 6. Going down to the Sea-side, I found
a large Tortoise or Turtle; this was the first I had
seen, which it seems was only my Misfortune, not
any desect of the Place, or Scarcity; for had I hap-
pen'd to be on the other side of the Island, I
might have had Hundreds of them every Day, as
I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear
enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the Turtle; I
found in her threescore Eggs; and her Flesh was to
me at that rime the most savoury and pleasant
that ever I tasted in my Lise, having had no Flesh,
but
t'**
— [ ,0r 3
but of Goats and Fowls, fince I landed in this
horrible Place.
June 18. Rain'd all Day, and I stay'd within.
I thought at this Time the Rain selt cold, and I
was something chilly, which 1 knew was not usual
in that Latitude.
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the Wea-
ther had been cold.
June 20. No Rest all Night, violent Pains in
my Head, and severish,
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to Death
with the Apprehensions of my fad Condition, to
be sick, and no Help: Pray'd to God for the
first Ti me since the Storm of Hull, but scarce
knew what I said, or why; my Thoughts being
all confused.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful
Apprehensions of Sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering,
and then a violent Head-ach-
June 24. Much better,
June 25. An Ague very violent; the Fit held
me seven Hours, cold Fit and hot, with faint
Sweats after it.
June 2d. Better; and having no Victuals to eat,
took my Gun, but found my self very weak;
however I kill'd a She-Goat, and with much Dif-
ficulty got it Home, and broii'd some of it, and
eat; I would fain have stew'd it, and made some
Broath, but had no Pot.
June 2 j. The Ague again so violent, that 1 lay
a-Bed all Day, and neither eat or drank. I was
ready to perish for Thirst, but so weak, I had
not Strength to stand up, or to get my self any
Water to drink: Pray'd to God again, but was
"ght-headed, and when I was not, 1 was so igno~
WHt»that I knew not what to fay; only I lay and
H 3 W «»
cry'd, Lord 'look upon me, Lord pity me, Lord home
Mercy upon me: I suppose I did nothing else for two
or three Hours, till the Fit wearing oft, I sell asleep,
and did not wake till far in the Night. When I
wak'd, I found myself much refresh'd, but weak,
and exceeding thirsty : However, as I had no Wa-
ter in my whole Habitation, I was forc'd to lye till
Morning, and went to steep again: In this second
Sleep, I had this terrible Dream.
I thought, that I was sitting on the Ground on -
the Outside of my Wall, where I fat when the
Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that I saw
a Man descend from a great black Cloud, in a
bright Flame of Fire, and light upon the Ground:
He was all over as bright as a FJame,fo that I could
but just bear to look towards him; his Counte-
nance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible
for Words to describe ; when he stepp'd upon the
Ground with his Feet, I thought the Earth trem-
bled, just as it had done before in the Earthquake,
and all the Air look'd, to my Apprehension, as if
it had been fill'd with Flashes of Fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the Earth, but
he moved forward towards me, with a long Spear
or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me; and when he
came to a rising Ground, at some Distance, he
spoke to me, or I heard a Voice so terrible, that
it is impossible to express the'Terror of it; all that
I can fay, I understood, was this, Seeing all these
Things have not brought thee to Repentance, now thou
jhalt die .- At which Words, I thought he lifted up
the Spear thar was in his Hand to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this Account, will
expect that I should be , ble to describe the Horrors
of my Soul at this rerrible Vision; I mean, that e-
ven while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of those
Horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe
'C "3 1 ;.
the Impression that remain'd upon my Mind when
I awaked and found it was but a Dream.
I had,alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had
received by the good Instruction of my Father was.
then worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8
Years, of Seafaring Wickedness, and a constant Con-
versation with nothing but such as were like my
self, wicked and profane to the last degree: I do
not remember that I had in all that Time one
Thought that so much as tended either to look-
ing upwards towards God, or inwards towards a
Reslection upon my own ways: But a certain Stu-
pidity of Soul, without Desire of Good, or Con-
science of Eyil, had entirely overwhelm'd me, and
I was all that the most hardned, unthinking, wicked
Creature among our common Sailors can be sup-
posed to be, not having the least Sense,' either of
the Fear of God in Danger, or of Thankfulness to
God in Deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my Story,
this will be the more easily believ'd, when I shall
add, that thro' all the Variety of Miseries that
had to this Day befallen me, I never had so much
as one Thought, of it being the Hand of God, oc
that it was a just Punishment for my Sin, my re-
bellious Behaviour against my Father, or my pre-
sent Sins, which were great, or so much as a Pu-
nishment for the general Course of my wicked Lise.
When I was on the desperate Expedition on the.
desart Shores of Africa, I never had so much as one
Thought of what would become of me, or one
Wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or
to keep me from the Danger which apparently fur-
rounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as
cruel Savages: But I was meerly thoughtless of God,
or a Providence, acted like a meer Brute from the
Principles of Nature, and by the Dictates of com-
»cm Sense only, and indeed hardly that.
H 4 When.
When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by the
Portugal Captain, well used, and dealt justly and
honourably with, as well as charitabhy, I had not
rhe least Thankfulness on my Thoughts. When
again 1 was shipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in Danger of
drowning on this Island, I was as far from Re-
morse, or looking on it as a Judgment; I only said
to myself often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and
born to be always miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and
sound all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and myself
spared, I was surprized with a kind of Extasy, and
some Transports of Soul, which, had the Grace oF
God assisted, might have come up to true Thank-
sulness; but it ended where it begun, in a meer
common Flight of Joy, or, as I may fay, being glad
lu-asalive, without the least Reslection upon the
distinguishing Gqodness of the Hand which had
preserv'd me, and had singled me out to be pre-
serves, when all the rest were destroy'd; or an En^
quiry why Providence had been thus merciful to
me; even just the fame common sort of Joy which
Seamen generally have after they have got fate a-
sbore from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in the
next Eowl of Punch, and forget almost as soon as
it is over, and all the rest of my Lise was like it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due Conside-
ration, made sensible of my Condition, how I was
cast on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of hu-
mane Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Prospect
of Redemption, as soon as I saw but a Prospect of
living, and that I should not starve and perish for
Hunger, all the Sense of my Affliction wore osf,
and I begun to be very easy, apply'd mysels to the
Works proper for my Preservation and Supply, and
was far enough from being afflicted at my Con-
dition, as a Judgment from Heaven, or as the
Hand
Hand of God against me: these were Thoughts
which very seldom enter'd into my Head.
The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in my
Journal, had at first some little Insluence upon me,
and began to assect me with Seriousness, as long as
I thought it had something miraculous in it; but
as soon as ever that Part of the Thought was re-
moved, all the Impression which was raised from it
wore off also, as I have noted already.
Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be
more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately
directing to the invisible Power, which alone di-
rects such things, yet no sooner was the first Fright
over, but the Impression it had made went oft' also.
I had no more Sense of God or his Judgments,
much less of the present Affliction of my Circum-
stances being from his Hand, than if I had been in
the most prosperous Condirion of Lise.
But now when I began to be sick, and a leisure-
ly View of the Miseries of Death came to place
itself before me; when my Spirits began to sink
undet the Burden of a strong Distemper, and Na-
ture was exhausted with the Violence of the Fe-
ver; Conscience, that had slept so long, began to a-
wake, and I began to reproach myself with my past
Lise, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon
Wickedness,
provoked the Justice of God to lay me
under uncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in
so vindictive a manner.
These Reslections oppress'd me for the second or
third Day of my Distemper, and in the Violence,
as well of the Fever as of the dreadful Reproaches
°f my Conscience, extorted some Words from me,
like praying to God, tho' I cannot fay they were
either a Prayer attended with Desires, or with
Hopes; it was rather the Voice of meer Fright
and Distress; my Thoughts were confused, the
Con-
Convictions great upon my Mind, and the Horror
of dying in such a miserable Condition, raised Va-
pours into my Head with the meer Apprehensions;
and in these Hurries of my Soul, I know not what
my Tongue might express: But it was rarher Ex-
clamation, such as, Lord! what a miserable Crea-
ture am I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die
for want of Help, and what will become of me!
Then the Tears burst out of my Eyes, and I could
fay no more for a good while.
In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father
came to my Mind, and presently his Prediction,
which I mention'd at the beginning of this Story,
viz. That if I did take this foolijh Step, God would not
Hess me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to refleEi
upon having negletJed his Counsel, when there might be
none to assist in my Recovery. Now, said I aloud,
my dear Father's Words are come to pass: God's
Justice has overtaken me, and 1 have none to help
or hear me: I rejected the Voice of Providence^
which had mercifully put me in a Posture or Sta-
tion of Lise, wherein I might have been happy
and easy; but I would neither see it myself, or learn
to know the Blessing of it from my Parents; I left
them to mourn over my Folly, and now I am left
to mourn under the Consequences of it: I refused
their Help and Assistance, who would have lifted
me into the World, and would have made every
thipg easy to me, and now I have Difficulties to
struggle with, too great for even Nature itself to
support, and no Assistance, no Help, no Comfort,
no Advice. Then I cry'd out, Lord be my Help, for
1 am in great Distress.
This was the first Prayer, if I may call it so,'
that I had made for many Years. But I return to,
my Journal.
5f#«<
June 28. Having been somewhat refresh'd with
the Sleep I had had, and the Fit being entirely
off, I got up; and tho' the Fright and Terror of
my Dream was very great, yet I consider'd, that
the Fit of the Ague would return again the next
Day, and now was my Time to get something to
refresh and support niy self when I should be ill;
and the first thing I did, I fill'd a large square
Case Bottle with Water, and set it upon my Table,
in reach of my Bed; and to take off the chill
or aguish Disposition of the Water, I put about
a Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it, and mix'd
them together; then I got me a Piece of the
Goat's Flesh, and broil'd it on the Coals, but could
eat very little; I walk'd about, but was very weak,
and withal, very fad and heavy-hearted in the Sense
of my miserable Condition, dreading the Return
of my Distemper the next Day; at Night I made
my Supper of three of the Turtle's Eggs, which
I roasted in the Ashes, and eat, as we call it, in
the Shell; and this was the first Bit of Meat I had
ever ask'd God's Blessing to, even as I could re-
member, in my whole Lise.
After I had eaten, I try'd to walk, but found
my self so weak, that I could hardly carry the
Gun (for I never went out without that;) so I
went but a little Way, and sat down upon the
Ground, looking out upon the Sea, which was
just before me, and very calm and smooth: As
I fat here, some such Thoughts as these occurred
to me:
What is this Earth and Sea of which I have seen
10 much! whence is it produe'd, and what am I,
and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal, whence a^e we;?
Sure
Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
form'd the Earth and Sea, the Air and Sky ; and
who is that?
Then it sollow'd most naturally, it is God that
has made it all: Well, but then it came on strange-
ly ; if God has made all these Things, He guides
and governs them all, and all Things that concern
them; for the Power that could make all Things,
must certainly have Power to guide and direct
them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great Circuit
of his Works, either wiehout his Knowledge or
Appointment.
And if nothing happens without his Know-
ledge, he knows that 1 am here, and am in this
dreadful Cordition; and if nothing happens wirh-
out his Appointment, he has appointed all this to
befal me.
Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict
any of these Conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater Force, that it must needs
be, that God hath appointed all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miserable Circumstance
by his Direction, he having the sole Power, not of
me only, but of every Thing that happen'd in the
World. Immediately it sollow'd,
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to
be thus us'd?
My Conscience presently check'd me in that En-
quiry, as if I had blasphem'd, and methought it
spoke to me like a Voice j WRENCH! dost thou
ask what thou hast done! Look back upon a dreadful
mis-spent Life, and ask thy self what thou hast not
done? Ask, Why is it that thou wt not long ago de-
stroy'd? Why wert thou not drown d in Yarmouth
Roads? Kill'd in the Fight when the Ship was taken bj
the Sallee Men of War? Devourd by the. wild Beasts
on the Coast of Africa? Or, drown d HE R E, -when
all the Crew ferijb'dbut tbjself? Dost thou ask, What
have I done?
I was struck dumb with these Reslections, as one
astonish'd, and had not a Word to fay, no not to
answer to my self, but rose up pensive and sad,
walk'd back to my Retreat, and went up over my
Wall, as if I had been going to Bed, but my
Thoughts were sadly disturb'd , and I had no in-
clination to sleep; so 1 sat down in my Chair, and
lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark. Now,
as the apprehension of the return of my Distemper
terrify'd me very much,it occurr'd to my Thought,
that the Bmsilians take no Physick but their To-
bacco, for almost all Distempers; and I had a
Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of. the Chests,
which was quite cured, and some also that was
green, and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven no doubt, for in.
this Chest I found a Cure both for Soul and Body;
1 open'd the Chest, and found what I look'd for,
the Tobacco; and as the sew Books I had
sav'd, lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles
which I mention'd before, and which to this time I
had not found Leisure, or so much as Inclination
to look into; I fay, I took it out, and brought both
that and the Tobacco with me to the Table. ,
What Use to make of the Tobacco, I knew not,
as to my Distemper, or whether it was good for it
or no; but I try'd several Experiments with it, as
if I was resolv'd it should hit one Way or other:
1 first took a piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my
Mouth, which indeed at first almost stupify'd my
Brain, the Tobacco being green and strong, and
that 1 had not been much ns'd to it; then I took
some and steeped it an Hour or two in some Rum,
and resolv'd to take a Dose of it when I lay down;
and
and lastly, I burnt some upon a Pan os Coals, and
held my Nose close over the Smoke of it as long as
I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almost for
Suffocation.
In the interval of this Operation, I took up the
Bible and began to read, but my Head was too
much disturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading,
at least at that time; only having opened the Book
casually, the first Words that occurr'd to me were
these, Call on me in the Day of Trouble, and I will de-
liver, and thou Jhalt glorify me.
The Words were very apt to my Case, and made
some Impression upon my Thoughts at the Time of
reading them, tho' not so much as they did after-
wards; for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no
Sound, as Imay fay, to me; the Thing was so remote,
so impossible in my Apprehension of Things, that
I began to fay as the Children of Israel did, when
they were promis'd Flcssi to eat, Can God spread a
"Table in the Wilderness? So I began to fay, Can God
himself deliver me from this Place? And as it was
not for many Years that any Hope appear'd, this
prevail'd very often upon, my Thoughts: But
however, the Words made a great Impression upon
me, and I mused upon them very often. It grew
now late, and the Tobacco had, as I said, doz'd
my Head so much, that I inclined to sleep; so I
lest my Lamp burning in the Cave, lest I should
want any thing in the Night, and went to Bed;
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done
in all my Lise, I kneel'd down and pray'd to God
to fulfil the Promise to me, that if I call a upon him
in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me; af-
ter my broken and impersect Prayer was over, I
drunk the Rum in which I had steep'd theTobacco,
which was so strong and rank of the Tobacco*
that indeed I could scarce get it down. Immediately
a upon
till.-]
upon this I went to Bed, I found presently it slew
up in my Head violently; but I sell into a found
Sleep, and waked no more till by the Sun it must
necessarily be near Three o' Clock in the Afternoon
the next Day; nay, to this Hour I am partly of the
Opinion, that I slept all the next Day and Night,
and till almost Three that Day after; for other-
wise I knew not how I should lose a Day out of my
Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it appear 'd
some Years after I had done; for if I had lost it by
crossing and re-crossing the Line, I should have lost
more than one Day: But certainly I lost a Day in.
ay Account, and never knew which way.
Be that however one way or other, when I
awak'd I found myself exceedingly refresh'd, and
my Spirits lively and chearful; when I got up, I
was stronger than I was the Day before, and my
Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in short,
I had no Fit the next Day, but continued much
alter'd for the better: this was the 29th.
The 30th was my Well Day of Course, and I
went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to
travel too far: 1 kill'd a Sea-Fowl or two, some-
thing like a Brand-Goose, and brought them Home,
but was not very forward to eat them; so I eat some
more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very good..
This Evening I renew'd the Medicine which I had
supposed did me good the Day before, viz,, the To-
bacco steep'd in Rum, only I did not take so much
as before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or hold
my Head over rhe Smoke; however, I was not
so well the next Day, which was the 1st of July,
as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little
spice of the cold Fit, but it was not much.
July i. I renew'd the Medicine all the three
ways, and doled myself with it as at first, and
doubled the Quantity which I drank.
3- 1
3. I miss'd the Fit for good and all, tho' I did
not recover my full Strength for some Weeks after:
While I was thus gathering Strength, my Thoughts
run exceedingly upon this Scripture, / will deliver
thee ; and the Impossibility of my Deliverance lay
much upon my Mind, in bar of my ever expecting
it: But as I was discouraging myself with such
Thoughts, it occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored so
much upon my Deliverance from the main Affli-
ction, that I disregarded the Deliverance I had re-
ceived; and I was, as it were, made to ask my-
self such Questions as these, viz,. Have 1 not been
deliver'd, and wonderfully too, from Sickness?
From the most distress'd Condition that could be,
and that was so frightful to me? and what notice
had I taken of it? Had I done my Part, God bad
deliver'd me, but I had not glorified him: that is to
fay, I had not own'd and been thankful for that
as a Deliverance, and how could I expect greater
Deliverance ?.
This touch'd my Heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneel'd down and gave God Thanks a-
loud, for my Recovery from my Sickness.
July 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and be-
ginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a
while every Morning and every Night, not tying
myself to the Number of Chapters, but as long as
my Thoughts should engage me: It was not long
after I set seriously to this Work, but I found
my Heart more deeply and sincerely asfected with
the Wickedness of my past Lise: The Impres-
sion of my Dream revived, and the Words, Al
l
these Ihings have not brought thee to Repentance, ran se-
riously in my Thoughts: I was earnestly begging
of God to give me Repentance, when it happen d
providentially the very Day that reading the Scrip-
ture,
ture, I came to these Words, He is exalted a Prince
and a Saviour, to give Repentance, aud to give Remissi-
on: I threw down the Book, and with my Heart as
well as my Hands listed up to Heaven, in a Kind
of Extasy of Joy, I cry ed out aloud, Jesus thou Soft
of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour,
give me Repentance I , \: n
This was the first time that I could fay, in the
true Sense of the Words, that I prayed in all my
Lise ; sot now I prayed with a Sense of my Condi-
tion, and with a true Scripture View of Hope
founded on the Encouragement of the Word of
God; and from this time, I may fay, Ibegan to
have Hope that God would hear me,
Now I began to construe the Words mentioned
above, Call on me, and I will deliver you, in a disfe-
rent Sense from what I had ever done before; for
then I had no Notion of any thing being called
Deliverance, but my being delivered from the Cap-
tivity I was in, for tho' I was indeed at large in
the Place, yet the Island was certainly a Prison to
me, and that in the worst Sense in the World; but
now l learn'd to take it in another Sense. Now I
look'd back upon my past Life with such Horror,
and my Sins appeared so dreadful, that my Soul
fought nothing of God, but Deliverance from the
Load of Guilt that bore down all my Comfort.
As for my solitary Lise it was nothing; I did not
so much as pray to be delivered from it, or think
of it; it was all of no Consideration in Compari-
son to this; and 1 added this Part here, to hint to
whoever shall read it, that whenever they cometo
a true Sense of things, they will find Deliverance
from Sin a much greater Blessing, than Delive-
rance from Afiliaion.
But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal-
I My
Part I. . .
My Condition began now to be, tho' not less
miserable as to my Way of living, yet much easier
to my Mind; and my Thoughts being directed, by
a constant reading the Scripture, and praying to
God, to things of a higher Nature; I had a great
deal of Comfort within, which till now I knew
nothing of: Also, as my Health and Strength re-
turned, I bestirr'd my self to furnish my self with
every thing that I wanted, and make my way of
living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiesly
employ'd in walking about with my Gun in my
Hand, a little and a little at a Time, as a Man
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of
Sickness: For it is hardly to beitnagin'd, how low
I was, and to what Weakness I wasredue'd. The
Application which I made use os was persectly
new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to
practise, by this Experiment; and tho'it did car-
ry osf the Fir, yet it rather contributed to weaken-
ing me; for I had frequent Convulsions in my
Nerves and Limbs for some time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that be.
ing abroad in the rainy Season was the most per.
nicious thing to my Health that could be, especi-
ally in those Rains which came attended with
Storms and Hurricanes of Wind j for as the Rain
which came in a dry Season was always most ac-
company 'd with such Storms, so I found that Rain
was much more dangerous than the Rain which
sell in September and Oftober.
I had been now in this unhappy Island above 10
Months; all Possibility of Deliverance from this
Condition seem'd to be entirely taken from me;
and I firmly believed, that no human Shape had
ever set Foot upon that Place. Having now secur'd
my
toy Habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I
had a great Desire to make a more persect Disco-
very of the Island, and to see what other Produ-
ctions I might sind, which yet I knew nothing
. It was the 19th of July that I began to take a
more particular Survey of the Island it self: I went
up the Creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought
my Rafts on Shore. I found, after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not slow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little
Brook of running Water, and very fresh and good 3
but thisbeingthe dry Season, there was hardly any
Water in some Parts of it, at least not enough to
run in any Stream, so as it could be perceiv d.
On the Bank of this Brook I found many plea-
sant Sayanas, or Meadows, plain, smooth, and
cover'd with Grass; and on the rising Parts of
them next to the higher Grounds, where the Wa-
ter, as it might be supposed, never overslowed, I
found a great deal of Tobacco,green and growing
toagreatand very strong Stalk: There were divers
other Plants which I had no Notion of, or Under-
standing about, and might pethaps haveVertues
of their own which I could not find out.
I searched for the Cajsava Root, which the Indi-
an in all that Climate make their Bread of, but I
could find none. I saw large Plants of Aloes, but
did not then understand them. I saw several Sugar
Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented my self with these Discoveries
for this time, ahd came back musing with my self
what Course I might take to know the Vertue
and Goodness of any of the Fruits or Plants which
1 should discover, but could bring it to noConcIu-
fion ; for in ftort, I had made so little Observa-
tion while I was in the Brasih, that I knew little
I a oF
of the Plants i» the Field, at least very little that
might serve me to any Purpose now in my Di-
stress. - .;
The next Day, the i6tb, I went up the fame
Way again, and after going something farther than
I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook and
the Savana's began to cease, and the Country be-
came more woody than before. In this Part I found
disserent Fruits, and particularly I sound Melons
upon the Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes
upon the Trees ; the Vines had spread indeed over
: the Trees, and the Ousters of Grapes were jost
now in their Prime, very ripe and rich. This was
a surprizing Discovery, and I was exceeding glad
of them; but I was warn'd by my Experience to
cat sparingly of them, remembring, that when I
was ashore in Bariary, the eating of Grapes kill'd
several of our Englijh Men who were Slaves there,
by throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers: But I
found an excellent Use for these Grapes, and that
was to cure or dry them in the Sun, and keep
them as dry'd Grapes or Raisins are kept, which
I thought would be, as indeed they were, as
wholesome, as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes
might be to be had.
I spent all that Evening there, and went not
back to my Habitation, which by the way was
the first Night, as I might fay, I had Iain from
Home. In the Night I took my first Contrivance,
and got up into a Tree, where I slept well, and
the next Morning proceeded upon my Discovery,
travelling near four Miles, as I might judge by
the Length of the Valley, keeping still due North,
with a Ridge of Hills on the South and North-
Side of me.
At the End of this March I came to an Open;
ing, where the Country seemed to descend to the
West,
C "7s J
West, and a little Spring of fresh Water, which
issued out of the Side of the Hill by me, run the
other Way, that is, due East; and the Country
appeared so fresh, so green, so slourishing, every
thing being in a constant Verdure or Flourish of
Spring, that it look'd like a planted Garden.
I descended a little on the Side of that delicious
Vale, surveying it with a secret kind of Pleasure,
(tho* mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was King
and Lord of all this Country indeseasibly, and
had a Right of Possession ; and if I could convey
it, I might have it in Inheritance, as compleatly
as any Lord of a Manor in England. I saw here
Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange and Lemon
and Citron Trees; but all wild, and sew bear-
ing any Fruit, at least, not then: However,
the green Limes that I gathered, were not only
pleasant to eat, but very wholesome ; and I
nix'd their Juice afterwards with Water, which
made it very wholesome, and very cool and re-
freshing.
I found now I had Business enough to gather
and carry Home; and I resolved ro lay upaStore,
as well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to fur-
nish my self for the wet Season, which 1 knew
was approaching.
In order ro this, I gather'd a grear Heap of
Grapes in one Place, and a lesser Heap in another
f'ace, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons
m another Place ; and taking a sew of each with
I travell'd homeward, and resolved to come
again, and bring a Bag or Sack, or what i could
make, to carry the rest Home.
Accordingly, having spent three Days in this
Journey, l came Home (so I must now call my
*ent and my Cave) but before I got thither, the
I , Grapes
Grapes were spoilt, the Richness of the Fruits
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them,
and bruised them, they were good for little or no-
thing; as to the Limes, they were good, but I
could bring but a sew.
The next Day, being the ipth, I went back,
having made me two small Baggs to bring Home
my Harvest: But I was surpriz'd, when coming to
my Heap of Grapes, which were so rich and fine
when 1 gathered them, I found them all spread
about, trod to Pieces, and dragg'd about, some
here, some there, and Abundance eaten and de-
voured : By this I concluded there were some wild
Creatures thereabouts, which had done this;
but what they were I knew not.
However, as I found that there was no laying
them up on Heaps, and no carrying them away in
a Sack, but that one Way they would be destroy'd,
and the other Way they would be crusii'd with
their own Weight, I took another Course ; for I
gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung
them upon the Out-Branches of the Trees, that
they might cure and dry in the Sun; and as for
the Limes and Lemons, I carry'd as many back
as I could well stand under.
When I came Home from this Journey, I con-
templated with great Pleasure the Fruitfulness of
that Valley, and the Pleasantness of the Situation,
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water,
and the Wood, and concluded that I had pitch'd
upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far
the worst Part of the Country. Upon the whole,
I began to consider of removing my Habitation,
and to look out for a Place equally sase, as where
I now was situate, if possible, in that pleasanc
fruitful Part of the Island.
This
This Thought run long in my Hoad, aud I was
exceeding fond of it for some Time, the Pleasant-
ness of the Place tempting roe; but when I came
to a nearer View of it, and to consider that I was
now by the Sea side, where it was at least possible
that something might happen to my Advantages
and by the fame ill Fate that brought mo hither,
might bring some other unhappy Wretches to the
fame Place; and tho' it was scarce probable that
any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose
my self among the Hills and Woods, in the Center
of the Island, was to anticipate my Bondage, and
to render such an Asfair not only improbable, but
impossible; and that therefore I ought not by a-
ny Means to remove.
However, I was so enamour'd of this Place,
that I spent much of my Time therefor the whole
remaining Part of the Month of July; and tho*
upon second Thoughts I refolv'd as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a Bower,
and surrounded it at a Distance with a strong
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could
reach, well stak'd, and fill'd between with Brufi-
.mod; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two
or three Nights together, always going over it
with a Ladder, as before ; so that I fancy'd now
I had my Country House, and my Sea-Coast-
House: And this Work took me up to the Be-
ginning of August.
I had but newly finisiVd my Fence, and began
to enjoy my Labour, but the Rains came on, and
made me stick close to my first Habitation ; for
tho' I had made me a Tent like the other, with a
Piece of a Sail, and spread it very well ; yet I
had not the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from
Storms, nor a Cave be^jnd me to retreat into,
when the Rains were extraordinary. .
1 ^ About
About the Beginning of August, as J said, I had
finish'd my Sower, and began to enjoy myself.
The third of August, I found the Grapes I had
hung up were persectly dry'd, and indeed, were
excellent good Raisins of the Sun; so I began to
take them down from the Trees, and it was very
happy that I did so; for the Rains which follow-
ed would have fpoil'd them, and I had lost the
best Part of my Winter Food; for I had above
two hundred large Bunches of them. No sooner
had I taken them all down and carry'd most of
them Home to my Cave, but it began to rain; and
from hence, which was the fourteenth of August,
it rain'd more or less every Day, till the middle of
oBobtr ; and somtimes so violently, that I could
not stir out of my Cave for several Days
fn this Season I was much surpriz'd with the
Increase of my Family: I had been concern'd for
the Loss of one of my Cats, who run away from
me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Astonish-
ment (he came home about the End of August,
with three Kittens. This was the more strange to
me, because tho* I had kill'd a wild Cat, as I
eall'd it, wirh my Gun ; yet I thought it was a
quite differing Kind from our European Cats; yet
the young Cats were the fame kind of House-
breed like the old one ; aDd both my Cats being
Females, | thought it very strange: But from these
three Cats, [ afterwards came to be so pester'd
with Cats, that I was forc'd to kill them like Ver-
min, or wild Beasts, and to drive them from my
House as much as possible.
From the fourteenth of August to the twenty
sixth, incessant Rain, so that 1 could not stir, and
W3s now very careful not to be much wet. Jn this
Confinement I began to be straitned for Food, but
venturing
venturing out twice, t one Day kill'd a Goat; and
the last Day, which was the twenty-sixth, found
a very large Tortoise which was a Treat to me,
and my Food was regulated thus-: I eat a Bunch
of Raisins for my Breakfast, a Piece of the Goat's
Flcfli, or of the Turtle, for my Dinner broil'd;
(for to my great Misfortune, 1 had no Vessel to
boil or stew any thing) and two or three of the
Turtle's Eggs for my Supper.
During this Confinement in my Cover by the
Rain, I work'd daily two or three Hours at en--
larging my Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on
towards one Side, till !came to the Outside of the
Hill, and made a Door or Way out, which came
beyond my Fence or Wall, and so I came in and
out this Way: But I was not perfectly easy at
lying so open; for as I had manag'd my self be-
fore, I was in a persect Enclosure, wfiereas now I
thought I lay expos'd, and, yet I could not per.
ceive that there was any living thing to sear, the
biggest Creature that I had yet seen upon the island
being a Goat.
September the thirtieth, I was now come to the
unhappy Anniversary of my Landing. 1 cast up the
Notches on my Post, and found I had been on
Shore three hundred and sixty five Days. 1 kept
this Day as a solemn Fast, setting it apart to Re-
ligious Exercise, prostrating my self on the Ground
w"th the most serious Humiliation, consessing my
Sins to God, acknowledging his righteous Judg-
ments upon me, and praying to him to have Mer-
cy on me, thro' Jesus Christ; and having not
tasted rhe least Refreshment for twelve Hours,
even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat a
Bisket-Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went
f° Bed, finishing the Day as I began it.
I bad all this time observed no Sabbath-Day;
for as at sirst I had no Sense of Religion upon my
Mind, I had after some time omitted to distin-
guish the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and so did not really
know what any of the Days were; but now ha-
ring cast up the Days, as above, I found I had
been there a Year; so I divided it into Weeks,
and set apart every seventh Day for a Sabbath;
tho' I found at the End of my Account I had lost
a Day or two in my Reckoning.
A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and
so I contented my self to use it more sparingly,
and to write down only the most remarkable E*
vents of my Lise, without continuing a daily Me-
morandum of other things.
The rainy Season, and the dry Season, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learnt to divide
them so, as to provide for them accordingly. But
I boughr all my Experience before I had it; and
this I am going to relate, was one of the most dis-
couraging Experiments that I made at all. I have
mention'd that I had sav'd the sew Ears of Barley
and Rice which I had so surprizingly found spring
up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe there
were about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twen-
ty of Barley ; and now I thoughtit a proper time
to sow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its
Southern Position going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground, as
well as I could with my wooden Spade, and di-
viding it into two Parts, I sow'd my Grain; but
as I was sowing, it casually occur'd to my
Thoughts, that 1 would not sow it all at first, be-
cause I did not know when was the proper time
for it; sol sow'd about two thirds of the Seed,
leaving about a Handful of each.
It
It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that
I did so, for not one Grain of that I sow'd this
time came to any thing ; for the dry Months fol-
lowing, the Earth having had no Rain after the
Seed was sown, it had no Moisture to assist its
Growth, and never came up at all, till the wet
Season had come again, and then it grew as if it
had been but newly sown.
Finding my first Seed did not grow, which I
easily imagin'd was by the Drought, I sought for
a moister Piece of Ground to make another Trial
in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new
Bower, and sow'd the rest of my Seed in February,
a little before the Vernal Equinox; and this hav-
ing the rainy Months of March and April to water
it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very
good Crop; but having Part of the Seed left on-
ly, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a
small Quantity at last, my whole Crop not a-
mounting to above half a Peck of each kind.
But by this Experiment 1 was made Master of
my Business, and knew exactly when the proper
Season was to sow; and that I might expect two
Seed -times, and two Harvests every Year.
While this Corn was growing, I made a little
Discovery which was of Use to me afterwards:
As soon as the Rains were over, and the Weather
began to settle, which was about the Month of
November, I made a Visit up the Country to my
Bower, where tho' I had not been some Months,
yet I found all things just as I lefc them. The Cir-
cle or double Hedge that I had made, was not on-
ly fitm and entire, but the Stakes which I had cut
out of some Trees that grew thereabouts, were all
Ihot out, and grown with long Branches, as muck
as a Willow-tree usually shoots the first Year after
lopping its Head. I could not tell what Tree to
call it, that these Stakes were cut from. I was
furpriz'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to see the
young Trees grow; and I prun'd them, and led
them up to grow as much alike as I could; and
it is scarce credible how beautiful a Figure they
grew into in three Years; so that tho' the Hedge
made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Dia-
meter, yet the Trees, for such I might now call
them, soon cover'd it; and it was a com-
pleat Shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry
Season.
This made me resolve to cut some more Stakes,
and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle
round my Wall, I mean that of my first Dwell-
ing, which I did ; and placing the Trees or Stakes
in a double Row, at about eight Yards distance
from my first Fence, they grew presently, and
were at first a fine Cover to my Habitation, and
afterward serv'd for a Desence also, as 1 shall ob-
serve in its Order.
I found now, that the Seasons of the Year
might generally be divided, not into Summer and
Winter; as in Europe; but into the rainy Seasons,
and the dry Seasons, which were generally thus:
Half February, ) R-^y, the Sun being then on,

The Rainy Season sometimes held longer or
shorter, as the Winds happen'd to blow ; but this
was the general Observation I made. After I had
found, by Experience, the ill Consequence of be-
ing abroad in the Rain, I took Care to furnish my
self with Provisions before-hand, that I might noC
be oblig'd to go out ; and T fat within Doors as
much as possible during the wet Months.
In this Time I found much Employment, (and
very suitable also to the Time) for I found great
Occasion of many things which I had no way to
furnish my self with, but by hard Labour and con-
stant Application; particularly, Itry'd many Ways
to make my self, a Basket, but all the Twigs I
could get for the Purpose prov'd so brittle, that
they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellent Ad-
vantage to me now, that when I Was a Boy, I
used to take great Delight in standing at a Basket-
maker s in the Town where my Father liv'd, to.
see them make their IVicker-viare; and being, as
Boys usually are, very officious to help, and a
great Observer of the Manner how thev work'd
those things, and sometimes lending a Hand, I
had by this means full Knowledge of the Methods
of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials;
when it came into my Mind, that the Twigs of
that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew,
might
might possibly be as tough as the Sallows, and
Willows, and Osiers in England, and I resolv'd to
try.
Accordingly the next Day I went to my Coun-
try-House, as I call'd it, and cutting some of the
smaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpose as
much as I could desire ; whereupon I came the next
time prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down a
Quantity, which I soon found, for there was great
Plenty of them; These I set up to dry withfn my
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Use,
I carry'd them to my Cave; and here during the
next Season, I employ'd myself in making, as well
as I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry
Earth, or to carry or lay up any thing as I had oc-
casion; and tho'l did not finish them very hand-
somely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for
my Purpose; and thus afterwards I took Care ne*
ver to be without them; and as my Wicker-ware
decay'd, I made more, especially I made strong
deep Baskets to place my Corn in, instead ofSacks,
when I should come to have any Quantity of it.
Having master'd this Difficulty, and employ'd
a world of Time about it, I bestirr'd myself to see,
if possible, how to supply two Wants. I had no
Vessels to hold any thing that was Liquid, ex-
cept two Runlets which were almost full of Rum,
and some Glass Bottles, some of the common Size,
and others which were Case-Bottles square, for
the holding of Waters, Spirits, &c. I had not so
much as a Pot to boil any thing, except a great
Kettle which I sav'd out of the Ship, and which
was too big for such Use as I desir'd it, viz,. to
make Broth, and stew a Bit of Meat by itself.
The second Thing I would fain have had, was a
Tobacco-Pipe; but it was impossible to me to
make
make one; however 1 found a Contrivance for
that too at last.
I employ'd my self in planting my second Rows
of Stakes or Piles* and in this Wicker working all
the Summer, or dry Season, when another Busi-
ness took me up more Time than it could be ima-
magin'd I could spare.
I mention'd before, that I had a great Mind to
see the whole Island, and that I had travelled up
the Brook, and so on to where I built my Bower,
and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on
the other Side of the Island. I now resolved to
travel quite cross to the Sea-shore on that Side:
So taking my Gun, a Harchet, and my Dog, and
a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than usual,
with two Bisket-Cakes, and a great Bunch of
Raisins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my
Journey. When I had pass'd the Vale where my
Bower stood, as above, I came within View of
the Sea, to the West, and it being a very clear
Day, I fairly desery'd Land, whether an Island or a
Continent, I could nor tell ; but it lay very high,
extending from the West to the W. S.W. at a
very great Distance; by my Guess it could not be
less than fifteen or twenty Leagues off.
I could not tell what Part of the World this
might be, otherwise than rhat I knew it must be
Part of America; and as I concluded by all my
Observations, must be near the Spanijh Dominions,
and perhaps was all inhabited by Savages, where
if I should have landed, 1 had been in a worse
Condition than I was now; and therefore 1 ac-
quiesced in the Dispositions of Providence, which
I began now to own, and to believe, order'd eve-
ry thing for the best; I fay, I quieted my Mind
*ith this, and left afflicting my self with fruitless
Wishes of being there.
- - Besides,
Besides, after some Pause upon this Affair, I
consider'd, that if this Land was the Spanijh Coast,
I.should certainly, one Time or other, see some
Vessel pass or re-pase one Way or other; but if
not, then it was the SavageGo&{k between the Spa-
ttifi Country and Brafils, which-where indeed the
worst of Savages; for they are Cannibals, or Men-
Eaters, and fail not to murther and devour all the
human Bodies that fall into their Hands. . .*. ..
With these Considerations I walk'd very lei-
surely forward. I found that Side of the Island
where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the
open or Savana Fields sweet, adorn'd with Flowers
and Grass, and full of very fine Woods. I saw A-
bundance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught
one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and
taught it to speak to me. I did, after some Pains
.raking, catch a young Parrot, for I knock'd it
-jdown with a Stick, and having recover'd it, I
.brought it home; but it was some Years before I
couid make him speak: However, at last I taught
him to call me by my Name very familiarly: But
the Accident that sollow'd, tho' it be a Trisle,
will be very diverting in its Place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I
found in the low Grounds, Hares, as I thought
them to be, and Foxes, but they disser'd greatly
from all the other Kinds Iliad met with ; nor could
I satisfy myself to eat them, tho' I kill'd several:
But I had no need to be venturous; for I had no
Want of Food, and of that which was very good
too; especially these three Sorts, v/«. Goats, Pid-
geons, and Turtle or Tortoise; which, added to my
Grapes, Leaden-Hall Market could not have fur-
nish'd a Table better than I, in Proportion to the
Company; and tho' my Case was deplorable
enough, yet I had great Cause for Thankfulness,
and
that 1 Was riot driven to any Extremities for
Food; but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.
I never travell'd in this Journey above two
Miles Outfight irt a Day, Or thereabouts; but I
took so many Turhs and Returns to see what Dis-
coveries I could make, that I came weary enough
to the Place where I refolv'd to sit down for all
Night; and then I either repos'd my self in a
Tree, or surrounded myself with a Row of Stakes
set upright in the Ground, either frem one Tree
to another, or so as no wild Creature could come
at me, without waking me.
As.soon as I came to the Sea-Shore, I was sur-
prized to see that I had taken up my Lot on the
worst Side of the Island; for here indeed the Shore
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles, whereas
on the other Side I had found but three in a Year
and half. Here was also an infinite Number of
Fowls of many Kinds, some of which I had seen,
and some of which I had not seen before, and
many of them very good Meat; but such as I knew
not the Names of, except those call'd Penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleas'd, but was
very sparing of my Powder and Shot; and there-
fore had more Mind to kill a She-Goat, if I could,
which I could better seed on: And tho* there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the
Island, yet it was with much more Difficulty that
I could come near them, the Country being flat
and even, and they saw me much sooner than
when I was on the Hill.
I consess this Side of the Country was much
pleafanter than mine, but yet I had not the least In-
clination to remove ; for as I was fix'd in my Ha-
bitation, it became natural to me,*and T scem'd all
the while I was here, tobeas it were upon a Jour-
ney, and from Home i However, 1 travell'd along
Part I. K thc
]
the Shore of the Seai towards the East, I suppose
about twelve Miles; and then setting up a great
Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I
would go Home again; and that the next Journey
I took should be on the other Side of the Island,
East from my Dwelling, and so round till I came
to my Post again; Of which in its Place.
I took another Way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island so
much in my View, that I could not miss sinding
my first Dwelling by viewing the Country; but i
found my self mistaken ; for being come about two.
ot three Miles, I found my self descended into a
very large Valley ; but so surrounded with Hills,
and those Hills covered with Wood, that I could
not see which was my Way by any Direction but
that of the Sun, nor even then, unless I knew very
well the Position of the Sun at that Time of the
Day.
It happen'd, to my farther Misfortune, that
the Weather prov'd hazey for three or four Days,
while I was in this Valley; and not being able to
fee the Sun, 1 wander'd about very uncomfortably,
and at last was obliged to find out the Sea-Side,
look for my Post, and come back the fame Way
I went; aud then by easy Journeys I turn'd home-
ward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my
Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, and other Things
very heavy.
In this Journey my Dog surpriz'd a young Kid,
and seiz'd upon it, and I running in to take hold
of it, caught it, and sav'd it alive from the Dog:
I-had a great mind to bring it Home if I could i
for I had often been musing, whether it might not
be possible to gtt a Kid or two, and so raise a
Breed of tame Goats, which might supply me
when my Powder and Shot should be all spent.
I made
t>3«]
I made a Collar to this little Creature, and
With a String which I made of some Rope-Yarn
which 1 always carry'd about me, I led him along,
tho' with some Disficulty, till I came to my Bow-
er, and there I enclos'd him, and left him; for I
was very impatient to beat Homejfrotn whence I
had been absent above a Month.
I cannot express what a Satisfaction it was to
tae, to come into my old Hutch, and lie down in
tay Hammock-Bed : This little wandring Journey,
without settled Place of Abode, had been so un.
pleasant to me, that my own House, as I call'd it
to my self, was a persect Settlement to me, com-
par'd to that; and it rendcr'd every thing about
tae so comfortable, that I resolv'd I would never
go a great Way from it again, while it should be
toy Lot to stay on the Island.
I repos'd myself here a Week, to rest and regale
myself after my long Journey ;during which, most
of the Time was taken np in the weighty Asfair
of making a Cage sot my Poll, who began now to
be a meer Domestick, and to be mighty well ac-
quainted with me. Then I began to think of the
poor Kid, which I had pent in within my little
Circle, and resolv'd to go and setch it Home, or
give it some Food; accordingly 1 went, and found
it where 1 left it; for indeed it could not get out,
but was almost starv'd for want of Food: I went
»od cut Boughs of Trees, and Branches of such.
Shrubs as 1 could find, and threw it over, and ha-
ving sed it, I ty'd it as 1 did before, to lead it a-
w*y ; but it was so tame with being hungry, that
I had no need to have ty'd it ; for it follow'd me
like a Dog ; and as I continually sed it, the Crea-
ture became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that
"became from that time one of my Domesticks
•Iso, and would never leave me afterwards.
K % The
[
The rainy Season of the Autumnal Equinox was
now come, and I kept the .30th of September in the
fame solemn manner as before, being the Anniver-
sary of my LandingontheMand, havmgnowbeen
there two Years, and nomore Prospedos being de-
liver' d than the first Day I came there. I spent the
whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledg-
ments of the many wonderful Mercies which my so-
litary Condition was attended with,and without,
which it might have been infinitely more miserable.
I gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had
been pleased to discover to me, even that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary 1
Condition, than 1 mould have been in a Liberty or
Society, and in all the Pleasures of the World. That
He could fully make up to me the Deficiences ot
my solitary State, and the want of Human So-
ciety, by his Presence, and the Communrcations or
his Grace to my Soul, supporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon his Providence
here, and hope for his Eternal Presence hereaster.
Ir was now that I began sensibly to seel how
much more happy the Lise I now led was, with
all its miserable Circumstances, than the wicked,
cursed abominable Lise I led all the past Part of
my Days; and now I changed both my Sorrows
and my Joys; my very Desires alter d. my Affe.
dions changed their Gusts, and my Delights were
persedly new, from what they were at my hrit
coming, or indeed for the two Years palt.
Before, as 1 walk'd about, either on my Hunt-
ing, or for viewing the Country, the Anguish of
mvSoul at my Condition would break out upon
rm- on a sudden, and my very Heart would die
within me, to think of the Woods, the Mountains,
the Desarts I was in ; and how I was a Prisoner
lock'd up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts^f the
[ 133 V
Ocean, in an uninhabited Wilderness, without
Redemption. In the midst of the greatest Com-
posures of my Mind, this would break out upon
me like a Storm, and make me wring my Hands,
and weep like a Child. Sometimes it would take
me in the Middle of my Work, and 1 would im^
mediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
Ground for an Hour or two together; and this-
was still worse to me; for if I could burst out into
Tears, or vent my self by Words, it would go off,
and the Grief having exhausted itself, would abate.
But now I began to exercise my self with new
Thoughts, 1 daily read the Word of God, and
apply'd all theComfdrts of it to my present State.
One Morning being very sad, I opened the Bible
upon these Words, / will never, never have thee, r.or
forsake thee; immediately it occurr'd, that these
Words were to me, why else should they be dire-
cted in such a Manner, just at the. Moment when I
was mourning over my Condition, as one forsaken
of God and Man? Well then, said I, if God does
not forsake me, of what ill Consequence can it be,
or what matters it, tho' the World should all for-
sake me ; seeing on the other Hand, if I had all the
World, and .should lose the Favour and Blessing
of God, there would be no ComDarison in the
Loss.
From this Moment I began to conclude in my
Mind, that it was possible for me to be more hap-
py in this forsaken, solitary Condition, than it was
probable I should have ever been in any other par-
ticalarState in the World ; and with this Thought
I was going to give Thanks to God for bringing
me to this Place.
I know not what it was, but something fhock'd
my Mind at that Thought, and 1 durst not speak
the Words: How canst thou be such a Hypocrite,
K 3 (i^d
(said I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for
a Condition, which however thou may'ft endea-
vour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather
pray heartily to be delivered from; so I stopt
there : But tho' { could not say, I thank'd God for
being there; yet I sincerely gave Thanks to God
for opening my Eyes, by whatever afflicting Pro-
vidences, to see the formerCpndiripn of my Lise,
and to mourn for my Wickedness, and repent. \
never open'd the Bible or shut it, but my very Soul
within me bkss'd God for directing my Friend in,
. England, without any Order of mine, to pack it
up among my Goods; and for assisting me after-
wards to save it out of the Wreck of the Ship.
Thus, and in this Disposition of Mind, I began
niy third Year ; and tho' { have not given the Rea-
der the Trouble of so particular an Account of my
Works this Year as the first; yet in general it may
be observed, that I was very seldom idle; but ha-
ving regularly divided my Time, according to the
several daily Employments that were before me,
such as, First, my Duty to God, and the reading
the'Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some
time for, thrice every Day. Semtd/y, The going
Abroad with my Gun for Food, which generally
took me up three Hours in every Morning, when if
did not Rain. Thirdly, The ordering, curing,pre-
serving and cooking what I had kill'd or catch'd for
my Supply ; these took up great Part of the Day t
Also it is to be considered, that the Middle of the
Day when the Sun was in the Zenith, the Violence
of the Heat was too great to stir out; so that
about four Hours in the Evening was all the time
I could be supposed to work in; with this Excep-
tion, that sometimes I changed my Hours of
Jlunting and Working, and went to Work in. the
Meaning,
Morning, and Abroad with ray Gun in the Aster-
noon.
To this short time allow'd for Labour, I desire
may be added the exceeding Laboriousness of my
Work, the many Hours which for want of Tools,
want of Help, and want of Skill, every thing I
did, took up out of my Time: For Example, I
was full two and forty Days making me a Board
for a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave;
whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, and Saw-
Pit, would have cut six of them out of the fame
Tree in half a Day. ;.»> .
My Case was this; it was to be a large Tree
which was to be cut down, because my Board was
to be a broad one. This Tree I was three Days
a cutting down, and two more cutting osf the
Bows, and reducing it to a Log, or Piece os Tim-
ber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing I
reduced both theSides of it into Chips, till it be-
gun to be light enough to move; then 1 turn'd it,
and made one side of it fmpoth, and slat, as a
Board from End to End; then turning that side
downward, cut the other side, till I brought the
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and smooth-
on both Sides. Any one may ;udge the Labour of
my Hands in such a Piece of Work; but Labour
and Patience carry'd me thro' that and many o-
ther things; 1 only observe this in particular, to
stew the Reason why so much of my time went
away with so little Work, w'x. that what might
be a little to be done with Help and Tools, was
a vast Labour, and requir'd a prodigious time to
do alone, and by Hand.
But notwithstanding this, with Patience and La-
bour I went thro' many things, and indeed every
thing that my Circumstances made necessary to me
* do, as will appear by what follows.
fp £ 1 l was
I was now in the Months of Ntvember and De-
cember, expecting my Crop of Barley and Rice,
The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them
was not great ; for as I obfcrv'd, my Seed of eath
was not above the Quantity of half a Peck; for
I had lost one whole Crop by sowing in the dry
Season; but now my Crop promis'd very well,
when cm a sudden I found 1 was in Danger of
losing it all again by Enemies of several Sorts,
which it was scarce possible to keep from it; as
first, the Goats, and wild Creatures which I call'd
Hares, who tasting the Sweetness of the Blade,
lay in it Night and Day, as soon as it came up,
and eat ic so close, that it could get no time to shoot
up into Stalk.
This I saw no Remedy for, but by making an
Enclosure about it with a Hedge, which I did
with a great deal of Toil ; and the more, because
it requir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land
was but small, suited to my Crop, I got it totally
well senced in about three Weeks time; and shoot-
ing some of the Creatures in the Day-time, I set
my Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him up
to a Stake at the Gate, where he would stand and
bark all Night long; so in a little time the Ene-
mies forsook the Place, and the Corn grew very
strong and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the Beasts ruined me before, while my
Corn was in the Blade, so the Birds were as likely
to ruin me now, when it was in the Ear; for go-
ing along by the Place to see how it throve, I saw
my little Crop surrounded with Fowls of I know
not how many Sorts, who stood as it were watchr
ing till I should be gone. I immediately let sly
among them (for I always h*d my Gun with me.)
I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little
Cloud
Cloud os Fowls, which I had not seen at all,
from among the Corn it self.
This touch'd me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in
a few Days they would devour all my Hopes,
that 1 (hould be starv'd, and never be able to raise
a Crop at al), and what to do I could not telT:
However, I resolv'd not to lose my Corn, if possi-
ble, tho' 1 lhould watch it Night and Day. In
the first Place, I went among it to see what Da-
mage was already done, and found they had
spoil'd a good deal of it; but rhat as it was yet
too green for them, the Loss was not so great, bat
that the Remainder was like to be a good Crop
if it could be sav'd.
I staid by it to load my Gun, and then coming
away I could easily see the Thieves sitting upon
all the Trees about me, as if they only waited rill
I was gone away, and the Event proved it to be
so ; for as I walk'd osf as if I was gone, I was no
sooner out of theirSight, but they dropt down one
by one into the Corn again. I was so provok'd,
that I could not have Patience to stay till more
came on, knowing that every Grain that they eat
now, was, as it might be said, a Peck-loaf to me in
the Consequence; but coming up to the Hedge, I
fir'd again, and kill'd three os them. This was
what Iwish'd for; so I took them up, and serv'd
them as we serve notorious Thieves in England,
(viz,) Hang'd them in Chains fora Terror to other's.
It is impossible to imagine almost, that this should
have such an Effect as it had; for the Fowls would
not only not come at the Corn, but in short they
forsook all that Part of the Island, and I cpuld
never see a Bird near the Place as long as my
Scare-Crows hung there.
This
This I was very glad of, you maybe sure; and
about the latter end of December, which was our
second Harvest of the Year, I reap'd my Crop.
I was sadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle to
cutitdown, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could out of one of the broad Swords or
Cutlasses, which 1 fav'd among the Arms out of
the Ship. However, as my first Crop was but
small, I had no great Disficulty to cut it down: In
stort, I reap'd it my way, for I cut nothing off but
the Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket
which I had made, and so rubb'd it out with my
Hands s And at the End of all my Harvesting, I
found that out of my half Peck of Seed, I had
near two Bushels of Rice, and above two Bushels
and a half of Barley, that is to jay, by my Guess*
tor I had no Measure at that time.
However, this was a great Encouragement to
me; and I foresaw that in time, it would please
God to supply me with Bread: And yet here I
was perplex'd again, for I neither knew how to
grind or make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how
to clean it and part it; nor if made into Meal, how
to make Bread of it ; and if how to make it, yet
I knew not how to bake it. These things being
added to my Desire of having a good Quantity for
Store, and to secure a constant Supply, 1 resolv'd
not to taste any os this Crop, but to preserve it all
for Seed against the next Season, and in the mean
time to employ all my Study and Hours of works
mg to accomplish this great Wori of providing
my self with Corn and Bread.
It might be truly said, that now I work'd fof
my Bread. 'Tis a little wonderful, and what I bc»
lieve sew People have thought much upon, (wz.) the
strange Multitude of little things necessary in the
Pfo*
Providing, Producing, Curing, Dressing, Making
and Finishing this one Article of Bread.
I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature,
found this to be my daily Discouragement, ami
was made more and more sensible of it every Hour,
even after I had got the first handful of Seed Corn,
which, 3$ I have said, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a Surprize.
First, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no
Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquer'd,
by making a wooden Spade, aslobserv'd before;
but this did my Work but in a wooden Manner;
and tho' it cost me a great many Days to make it,
yet for want of Iron it not only wore out the
sooner, but made my Work the harder, and made
it be perform'd much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it out with Patience, and bear with the Bad-
ness of the Performance. When the Corn was
sow'd, I had no Harrow, but was forced to go
Over it my self, and drag a great heavy Bough of a
Tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be call'd, ra-
sher than Rake or Harrow it.
When it was growing and grown, I have ob-
sery'd already how many things 1 wanted, to
sence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and
carry k Home, thrasli, part it from the Chaff,
and save it. Then I wanted a Mill to grind it,
Sieves to dress it, Yeast and Salt to make it into
Bread, and an Oven to bake it; and yet all these
things I did without, as stall be obscrv'd ; and
yet the Corn was an inestimable Comfort and Ad-
vantage to me too. All this, as I said, made
every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that
there was no Help for; neither was my time so
W-uch Loss to me, because 1 had divided it, a
certain Part of it was every Day appointed to
, these
9
these Works; and as I resolv'd to use none of the
Corn for Bread rill I had a greater Quantity by
me, I had the next six Months to apply my self
wholly by Labour and Invention to furnish my self
with Utensils proper for the performing all the
Operations necessary for the making the Corn
(when I had it) fit for my Use.
But first, I was to prepare more Land, for I
had now Seed enough to sow above an Acre of
Ground. Before I did this, I had a Week's Work
at least to make me a Spade, which when it was
done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy,
and requir'd double Labour to work with it;
however I went thro' that, and sow'd my Seed in
two large slat Pieces of Ground, as near my
House as I could find them to my Mind, and
sepc'd them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were all cut of that Wood which I had set
before, and knew it would grow, so that in one
Year's time I knew I should have* a Quick or Li-
ving Hedge, that would want but little Repair.
This Work was not so little as to take me up less
than three Months, because great Part of that
time was of the wet Season, when I could not
go abroad.
Within Doors, that is, when it rained, and I
could not go out, I found Employment on the fol-
lowing Occasions; always observing, that all the
while I was at Work, I diverredmy self with talk-
ing to my Parrot, and teaching him to Speak;
and I quickly learned him to know his own Name,
and at last to speak it out prerty loud, POLL,
which was the first Word I ever heard spoken in
the Island by any Mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my Work, but an Assistant to my
Work; for now, as I said, I had a great Employ-
ment upon my Hands, as follows, (vii) I had
long
long study'd, by some Means or other, to make
my self some Earthen Vessels, which indeed I
wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at
them: However, considering the Heat ot the
Climate, I did not douot but if I could find ouc
any such Clay, 1 might botch up some such Pot, as
might, being dty'd in the Sun, be hard enough,
and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold
any Thing that was dry, and required to be kept
so; and as this was necessary in the preparing
Corn, Meal.drc. which was the Thing I was up-
on, 1 resolved to make some as large as I could,
and fit only to stand like Jars to hold what should
be put into them. . >
It would make the Reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how 'many aukward Ways I
took to taise this Paste, what odd mishapen ugly
Things I made, how many of them fell in, and how
many sell out, the Clay not being stiff enough to
bear its own Weight; how many crack'd by the
over violent Heat of the Sun, being set out too
hastily ;and how many sell in Pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dry'd;
and in a Word, how after having laboured hard
to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper ir, to bring
it home and work it, 1 could not make above two
large Earthen ugly things, I cannot call them Jars,
in about two Months Labour.
However, as the Sun bak'd these two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set
them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets,
which I had made on purpose for them, that they
might not break ; and as between the Pot and the
Basket there was a little roomro spare, I stuss'd it
full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and these two
Pots being to starid always dry, I thought would.
hold
hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal when
the Corn was bruised-
Tho' I miscarried so much in my Design for
large Pots, yet I mide several smaller things with
better Success; such as little round Pots, slat Dish-
es, Pitchers and Pipkins, and any thing my Hand
turn'd to, and the Heat of the Sun bak'd them
strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my End, which
was to get an Earthen Pot to hold what was Li-
quid, and bear the Fire, which none of these could
do. It happen'd aster some time, making a pretty
large Fire for cooking my Meat, when I went to
put it out after I had done with it, I found a bro-
ken Piece of one of my Earthen-ware Vessels in the
Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile.
1 was agreeably surpriz'd to see it, and said to my
self, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to studying how to order my Firei
so as to make it burn me some Pots, i had no
notion of a Kiln, such as the Potters burn in, of
of glazing them with Lead, tho' I had some Lead
to do it with; but I plac'd three large Pipkins,
and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon another*
and plac'd my Fire-wood all round it with a great
Heap of Embers under them; I ply'd the Fire
with fresh Fuel round the Outside, and upon the
Top, till I saw the Pots in the Inside red hot quite
thro', and obscrv'd that they did not crack at all;
when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in
that Heat about 5 or 6 Hours, till I found one of
them, tho' it did not crack, did melt or rpn, for
the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted
by the Violence of the Heat, and would have run
into Glass if I had gont on; so I slack'd my Fire
gradually, till the Pots began to abate of the red
Colour
Colour, awl watching them all Night, that I
might not let the Fire abate too fast, in the Morn-
ing I had three very good, I will not say hand-
some Pipkins, and two other Earthen Pots, as hard
burnt as could be desir'd ; and one of them per-
sectly glaz'd with the Running of the Sand.
After this Experiment, I need not fay that I
wanted no fort of Earthen Ware for my Use ; but
1 must needs fay, as to the Shapes of them, they
were very indisserent, as any one may suppose,
when I had no Way of making them, but as the
Children make Dirt-Pyes, or as a Woman would
make Pyes that never learnt to raise Paste.
No Joy at a Thing of so mean a Nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an
Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire; and 1 had
hardly Patience to stay till they were cold, before
I set one upon the Fire again, with some Water in
it, to boil me some Meat, which it did admirably
well; and with, a Piece of a Kid I made some ve-
ry good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and
several other Ingredients requisite to make it so
good as I would have had it been.
My
next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor-
tar to stamp or beat some Corn in; for as to the
Mill, there was no Thought at arriving to that
P«ssecticmof Art, with onePair of Hands. To sup-
ply this. Want I was at a great Loss; for of all
Trades in the World I was as persectly unqualisied
for aStone-Cutter,as for any whatever; neither had
I any Tools to go about it with. I spent many 4
Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cue
hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could find
none at all, except what was in the solid Rock, and
which I had no Way to dig or cut out; nor indeed
were the Rocks in the lsland of Hardness susfiei-
«nt, but were all of a sandy crumbling Stone,
which
which would neither bear the Weight of a heavy
Pestle, or would break the Corn without filling it
with 6and : So aster a gre3t deal of Time lost in
searching for a Stone, I gave it over, and resolv'd
to look out a great Block of hard Wood, which
I found indeed much easier; and getting one as
hig as 1 had Strength to stir, I rounded it, and
form'd it on the Outside with mv Axe and Hat-
chet, and then with the Help of Fire and infinite
Labour, made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians
in Brafil make their Canoes. After this, I-made a
great heavy Pestle or Beater, of the Wood call'd
the Iron-Wood, and this 1 prepared and laid by
against I had my next Crop of Corn, when I pro-
pos'd to my self to grind, or rather pound, my
Corn into Meal to make my Btead.
My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or
Searse, to dress my Meal, and to part it from the
Bran and the Husk, without which I did not see
it possible I could hare any Bread. This was a
most difficult Thing, so much as but to think on;
fortobe sure I had nothinglike the necessary Thing
to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas, ot Stuff to
search the Meal through. And here I was at a full
Stop for many Months; nor did I really know
what to do ; Linnen I had none left, but what was
meer Rags; I had Goats Hair, but neither knew
I how to weave it or spin it; and had 1 known
haw, here was no Tools to work it with ; all the
Remedy that I found for this, was, That at last I
did remember I had among the Seamens Cloaths
which were fav'd out of the Ship, some Neckloaths
of Callicoe or Muslin: and with some Pieces of
these I made three small Sieves, but proper enough
for the Work ; and thus I made shift for some Years;
how I did afterwards, I shall shew in its Place.
The
The baking Part was the next thing to be con-
sider'd, and how I should mate Bread when] came
to have Corn; for first 1 had no Yeast. As to that
Part, as there was no supplying the Want, so I did
not concern my self much about it: But for an
Oven, I was indeed in great Pain. At length I
found out an Experiment for that also, which was
this; I made some Earthen Vessels very broad, but
not deep; that is to fay, about two Foot Diame-
ter, and not above nine Inches deep; these I burnt
in the Fire, as i had done the other, and laid them
by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
Fire upon my Hearth, which I had pav'd with
some square Tiles of my own making and burn-
ing also ; but I should not call them square.
When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty muchinto
Embers, or live Coals, I drew them forward upon
this Hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there I
let them lye, till the Hearth was very hot; then
sweeping away all the Embers, I set down my
Loaf, or Loaves, and whelming down the Earth-
en Pot upon them, drew the Embers all round the
Outside of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the
Heat; and thus, as well as in the best Oven in the
World, I bak'd my Barley-Loaves, and became in
little time a meer Pastry.-Cook into the. Bargain;
for 1 made my self several Cakes of the Rice and
Puddings; indeed I made no Pics, neither had I
any Thing to put into them, supposing I had, ex-
cept the Flesl; either of Fowls or Goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took me up most Part of the third Year of my A-
boad here? for it is to be Observ'd, that in the In-
tervals of these Things, I had my new Harvest an4
Husbandry to manage; for I reap'dmy Corn in its
Season, and carry'd it Home as well as 1 could, and
'aid it up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, till I had
Part L L Tiroe
Time to rub it out; for I had no Floor to thrash
ir on, or Instrument to thrash it with.
And now indeed my Stock of Corn encreasing, I
really wanted to build my Barns bigger: i wanted
a Place to lay it up in; for the Increase of the Corn
now yielded me so much, that I had of the Barley
about twenty Bushels, and of the Rice as much, or
more ; insomuch, that now I resolved to begin to
use it freely, for my Bread had been quite gone a
great while; also 1 resolved to see what Quantity
would be sufficient for me a whole Year, and to
sow but once a Year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bushels
of Barley and Rice was much more than I could
consume in a Year; so I resolved to sow just the
same Quantity every Year that I sow'd the last, in
hopes that such a Quantity would fully provide me
with Bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may
be sore my Thoughts run many rimes upon the
Prospect of Land which 1 had seen from the other
Side of the Island, and I was not without secret
Wifiies that I was on Shore there, fancying the
seeing the main Land, and an inhabited Country,
1 might find some Way or other to convey myself
farther, and perhaps at last find some Means of
Escape.
But all this while I made no Allowance for the
Dangers of such a Condition, and how J might fall
into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps such as I
might have Reason to think far worse than the Li-
ons and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came in-
to their Power, 1 should run a Hazard more than a
thousand to one of being kill'd, and perhaps of be-
ing eaten ; for 1 had heard that the People of the Car-
rMan Coasts were Cannibals, or Men-eaters; and
I knew by the Latitude, that I could not be far osf
from.
from that Shore; That suppose they were not Can-
nibals, yet that they might kill me, as many Euro-
pans who had fallen into their Hands had been ser-
ved, even when they had been ten or twenty
together ; much more I that was but one, and
could make little or no Desence. Al l these
things, I fay, which I ought to have consider'dwell
of, and I did cast up in my Thoughts afterwards,
yet tookup noneof my Apprehensions at first; and
my Head run mightily upon the Thought ot
getting over to the Shore.
Now I wisiVd for my Boy Xury, and the Long-
Boat with the Shoulder of Mutton Sail, with
which I sail'd above a Thoufand Miles on the
Coast of Africk; but this was in vain. Then I
thought I would go and look on our Ship's Boar,
which, as I have said, was blown up upon the
Shore a great Way in the Storm, when we were
first castaway. She lay almost where she did at first,
but not quite ;and was tutn'd by the force of the
Waves and the Winds, almost Bottom upward,
against a high Ridge of beachy rough Sand; but
no Water about her as before
If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to
have launch'd her into the Water, the Boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gon«
back into the Brasih with her easily enough; but
I might have easily foreseen, that 1 could no more
turn her, and set her upright upon her Bottom, than
I could remove the Island. However, I went to the
Wood and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought
them to the Boat, resolv'd to try what I could do;
suggesting to my self, that if I could but turn her
down, 1 might easily repair the Pamage see had
received, and see would be a very good Boat, and
1 might go to Sea in her very easily.
I spar d no Pains indeed in this Piece of fruitless
Toil, and spent, I think, three or four Weeks a*
L a bout
bout it: at last finding it impossible to heave it up
with my little Strength, 1 sell to digging away the
Sand to undermine it, and so to make it fall
down, setting Pieces of Wood to thrust and
guide it right in the Fall.
But when 1 had done this, I was unable to stir
it up again, or to get under it, much less to move
it forwards towards the Water; so I was forc'd
to give it over; and yet, tho' 1 gave over the
Hopes of the Boat, my Desire to venture over
for the Main increased, rather than decreased, as
the Means for it seem'd impossible.
This at length put me upon thinking, whether
it was not possible to make myself aCanoe mVjcria-
gua, such as the Natives of those Climates make,
even without Tools, or, as 1 might fay, without
Hands, viz,, of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I
not only thought possible, but easy, and pleas'd
my self extreamly with the Thoughts of making ir>
and with my having much more Convenience for
it than any of the Negroes or Indians; but not
at all considering the particular Inconveniences
which I lay under, more than the Indians did, viz..'
Wantof Hands to moveit, when it was made* into
the Water; a Difficulty much harder for me to
surmount, than all the Consequences of Want of
Tools could be to them .. For what was it to me,
that when I had chosen a vast Tree in the Woods,
I might with great Trouble cut it down, if after I
might be able with my Tools to hew and dub the
Outside into a proper Shape of a Boat, and
burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so
to make aBoat of it, if after all this, 1 must leave
ir just there where I found it, and was not able
to launch it into the Water.' J t"1s«^J
One would have thought, I could'riot? havehad1
the least Reslection upon my Mind of my Circum-..
*' v;.' . stance?
fiance, while I was making this Boat, but I should
have immediately thought how I should get it into
the Sea; but. my Thoughts were so intent upon
my Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never once
considet'd how I should get it osf of. the Land;
and it was really in its own Nature more easy for
me to guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than
about Forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay^
lo set it a-sloat in the Water.
I went to work upon this Boat the most like a
Fool that ever Man did, who had any of his
Senses awake. I pleas'd my self with the Design,
without determining whether I was ever, able to
undertake it j not but that the Disficulty of launch-
ing my Boat came often into my Head ; but I put
a stop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolish
Answer which 1 gave my self, Let's first make it, I'll
.warrant ill find some Way or other to get it along,
when 'tis datfir x -\ . ,
. This was a most preposterous Method; but the
Eagerness of my Fancy prevail'd, and to work I
went. I seH'd a Cedar Tree; I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the Build-
ing the Temple at Jerusalem. It was five Foot
ten Inches. Diameter at the lower Part next the
Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at
the End of twenty two Foot, after which it les-
sen'd for a while, and then parted into Branches:
It was not, without infinite Labour that I sell'd
this Tree,:.I was twenty Days hacking and hew-
ing at it at the Bottom; I was fourteen more get-
ting the Branches and Limbs, and the vast spread-
ing Head of it cut off, which 1 hack'd and hew'd
through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpressible
.-Labour: After this, it cost me a Month .to shape
.it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to something
like the Bottom of a Boat, that it might swim up-
L i r!§hc .
!>*>]
right as it ought to do. It cost me neai three
Months more to clear the Inside, and work it out
so, as to make an exact Boat of it: This I did in-
deed withoutFire, by mere Mallet and Chislel, and
by the dint of hard Labour, till I had brought it to
be a very handsome Periagua, and big enough to
have carried six and twenty Men, and consequently
big enough to have carried me and all my Cargo.
When I had gone through this Work, I was ex»
tremely delighted with it. The Boat was really
much bigger than I ever saw a Canoe, or Periagua,
that was made of one Tree, in my Lise. Many a
weary Stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and
there remained nothing but to get it into the Water;
'and had I gotten it into the Water, I make noque-
stion, but I should have began the maddest Voy-
age and the most unlikely to be perform'd, that
ever was undertaken.
But all my Devices to get it into the Water
fail'dme, though they cost me infinite Labour too.
It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water,
and not more: But the first Inconvenience was, it
was up Hill toWatds the Creek: Well, to take 4'-
way this Discouragement, I resolv'd to dig into
the Surface of the Earth, and so make a Declivi-
ty: This I begun, and it cost me a prodigious deal
of Pains; bur who grudges Pains, that have their
Deliverance in View? But when this was work'd
through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was still
much at one: for I could no more stir the Came
than I could the other Boat.
Then I measut'd the Distance of Ground, and
resolv'd to cut a Dock, or Canal, to bring the Wa-
ter up to the Canoe, seeing I could not bring the
Canoe down to the Water; Well, I began this
Work, and when 1 began to enter into it, and cal-
culated how deep it was to be dug, how broad,
haw
how the Stusf to be thrown out, I sound, that by
the Number of Hands I had, being none but my
own, it must have been ten or twelve Years before
1 should have gone through with it; for the Shore
lay high, so that at the upper End it must havet
been at least twenty Foot deep ; so at length, tho'
with great Reluctancy, I gave this Attempt over,
also. ..-..„
This griev'd me heartily, and now I ,saw, tho'
too late, the Folly of beginning aWork before we
'count the Cost, and before we ;udge rightly of
our own Strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this Work, I finisb'd my fourth
Year in this Place, and kept my Anniversary with
the same Devotion, and with as much . Comfort as
ever before; for by a constant Study, and serious
Application of the Word of God, and by the As-
sistance of his Grace, I gain'd a disserent Know-
ledge from what I had before. 1 entertain'd disse-
rent Notions of things. I Iook'd now upon the
World as a thing remote, which 1 had nothing to
do with, no Expectation from, and indeed no De-
sires about: In a Word, I had nothing indeed to
do with it, nor was ever like to have ; so l thought
k Iook'd as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
«*. as a Place I had lived in, but was come out of
it; and well might I fay, as Father Abraham to
Dives, Between me and thee is a great Gulf h fixed.
In the first Place, 1 was removed from all the
Wickedness of the World here: 1 had neither the
Lust of the Flejh, the Lust of the Eye, or the Pride of
Uft. I had nothing to covet; for I had all that t
was now capable of enjoying; I was Lord of the
whole Manor ; or if Ipleas'd I might call myself
King, or Emperor over the whole Country which
I had Possession of. There were no Rivals : I had
no Competitor, none to dispute Sovereignty or
Command wkh me. I might have fats'd Ship-
Load ings of Corn; but I had no Use for it; sol let
as little grow as I thought enough for my Occasi-
on. I had Tortoise or Turtles enough ; but now
and then one was as much as 1 could put to any
Use. I had Timber enough to have built a Fleet
of Ships. I had Grapes enough to have made Wine,
or to have cur'd into Raisins, to have leaded that
Fleet when they had been built.
But all I could make use of, was All that was
valuable. 1 had enough to eat, and to supply my
Wants, and what was all the rest to me? if i kill'd
more Flesh than 1 could eat, the Dog must eat it,
or the Vermin; if I sow'd more Corn than I
could eat, it must be spoil'd. The Trees that I
cut down were lying to rot on the Ground: I
could make no more Use of them than for Fewel,
and that 1 had no Occasion for, but to dress my
Food. 'v
In a Word, the Nature and Experience of
Things dictated to me upon just Reslection, that
all the good Things of this World, are no farther
good to ns.ithan they, are for our Use ; and that
whatever we may heap up indeed to: give others,
we enjoy as much as we can use, and no more.
The most covetous griping Miser in the World
would have been cured of the Vice of Covetousness,
if he had been in my Case ;for I possessed infinitely
more than 1 knew what to do with. 1 had no room
for Desire, except it was of things which 1 had not,
and they were but Trifles, tho' indeed of great
Use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Parcel
of Money, as well Gold as Silver, above thirty
six Pounds Sterling: Alas I there the nasty sorry
useless Stuff lay; I had no manner of Business
for it; and I often thought with my self, that I
would have given a Handful of it for a Gross of
Tobacco^.
Tobacco Pipes, or for a Hand-mill to grind my
Corn ; rtay,l would have given it all forSixpenny-
worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed put of England,
or for a Handful of Pease and Beans, and a Bottle
of Ink; As it was, I had not the least Advantage
by it, or Benefit from it; but there it lay in a Draw-
er, and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave,
in the wet Season; and if I had had the Drawer
full of Diamonds, it had been the fame Case ; and
they had been of no manner of Value to me, be-
cause of no Use.
I had now brought my State of Life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my Mind, as well as to my Body. J frequently
fat down to my Meat with Thankfulness, and ad-
mired the Hand of God's Providence, which had
thus spread my Table jn the Wilderness. \ learned
to look more upon the bright Side of my Condi-
tion, and less upon the dark Side; and to consider
iwbat. I enjoy'd, rather than what 1 wanted; and
this gave me sometimes such secret Comforts, that
I cannot express them; and which I take Notice
of here, to put those discontented People in mind
of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God
has giyen them, because they see and covet some-
thing that he has not given them. All our Dis-
contents about whatj.we want, appeared to me to
spring from the Want of Thankfulness for what
we have, ...... ;j'. .
. Another Reslection was of great Use to me, and
'doubtless would be so to any one that should fajl
into such Distress as mine was ; and this was to
compare my present Condition with what I at first
expected it should be; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good Providence of
God hid not wonderfully ordered the Ship to be
cast up nearer to the Shore, where I not only could
Lome
come at her, but could bring what I got out of
tier to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort;
without which, I had wanted for Tools to work,
Weapons for Desence, or Gun powder and Shoe
for getting my Food.
1 spent whole Hours, I may fay whole Days, in
representing to my self in the most lively Colours,
bow I must hare acted, if 1 had got nothing out
of the Ship ; how I could not have so much as
got any Food, except Fish and Turtles; and that
as it was long before 1 found any of them, I must
have perisiYd first: That I should baveliv'd, if I
had not perish'd. like a meer Savage: That if I
had kill'd a Goat, ora Fowl, by any Contrivance,
I had no way to slea or open them, or part the
Flesti from the Skin and the Bowels, or to cut it
.up ; but must gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it
with my Claws like a Beast."'1 r -
- These Reslections made me vcty sensible of the
Goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my present Condition, with all its Hard/hips
and Misfortunes : And this Part also I cannot but
recommend to the Reslection of'thbse who are apt
in their Misery to say, IsanyirfjjliEiion like mint?
Let them consider, how much-' worse the Cases of
some People are, and theirCase might have been,
if Providence had thought fic.
I had another Reslection which assisted me also
to comfort my Mind with Hopes; and this was
comparing my present Condition with what I had
deserv'd, and had therefore Reason to expect from
the Hand of Providence. I had liv'd a dreadful
Lise,persectly destitute of the Knowledge and Fear
of God. I had been well instructed by Father and
Mother; neither had they been wanting to me in
their early Endeavours, to infuse a religious Awe
of God into my Mind, a Sense of my Duty, and
of
of what the Nature and End of my Being requir'd
of me. But alas! falling early into the Sea-faring
Lise, which of all the Lives is the most destitute
of the Fear of God, tho' his Terrors are always
besore them; I fay, falling early into the Sea-fa^
ring Lise, and into Sea-faring Company, all that
little Sense of Religion which I had entertain'd,
was lau?ht out of me by my Mess-Mates, by a
harden'd despising of Dangers, and the Views
of Death, which grew habitual tome, by my long
Absence from all manner of Opportunities to con-
verse with any thing but what was like my self, or
to hear apy thing that was good, or tended to-
wards it. :o .is ;.;,<-,:.,
So v oid was I of every thing that was good, or
of the least Sense of what I was, or was to be,
that in the greatest Deliverances I enjoy'd, such
as my Escape from Salle, my being taken up by the
Portuguez,} Master of the Ship, my being planted
so well in Brafils, my receiving the Cargo from
England, and the like, I never once had the Word
Thank God, so much as on my Mind, or in my
Mouth; nor in the greatest Distress had I so mnch
as a Thought to pray to him 5 or so much as to fay,
Lord have Meny upon mel no nor to mention the
Name of God, unless it was to swear by, and
blaspheme itv v. - . i*
I had terrible Reslections upon my Mind forma-
my Months, asl have already observ'd, on the Ac-
count of my wicked and harden'd Lise past; and
when I look'd about me, and consider'd what par-
ticular Providences had attended me since my co-
ming into this Place, and how God had dealt boun*
> tifully with toe ; had notonly punished me less than
my Iniquity had deserv'd, but had so plentifully pro-
vided for me; this gave me great Hopes that my
> ~ Rcpen-
Repentance was accepted, and that GOD had
yet Mercies in Store for me; .,
With these Reslections I work'd my Mini up,
not only to Resignation to the Will of God in the
present Disposition of my Circumstances, but even
to a sincere Thankfulness for my Condition; and
that I who was yet a living Man, ought not to
complain, seeing I had not the due Punishment of
my Sins that I enjoy'd so many Mercies which
1 had no Reason to have expected in that Place;
that I ought never more to repine at my Condition,
but to rejoyce, and to give daily Thanks for that
daily Bread which nothing but a Croud of Wonders
could have brought. That I ought to consider I
had been sed even by a Miracle, even as great as
that of seeding Elijah by Ravens; nay, by a long
Series of Miracles, and that I could hardly have
nam'd a Place in the unhabitable Part of the World,
where I could have been cast more to my Advanv
tage; A Place, where, as I had no Society, which
was'my Affliction on one Hand, so I found no ra-
venous Beasts, no furious Wolves or Tygers to .
threaten my Lise; no venomous Creatures or poi-
sonous, which might seed on my Hurt, no Sa-
vages to murder and devour me, V ,
In a Word, as my Lise was a Lise of Sorrow
one Way, so it was a Lise of Mercy another; and
I. wanted nothing to make it a Lise of Comfort,
but to be able to make my Sense os God's Good:
ness to me, and Care over me in this Condition,
be my daily Consolation; and after I did make a
just Improvement of these Things,,I went away
and was no more fad. ..*.-.:
I had now been here so long, that many Things
which I brought on Shore for my Help, were ei-
ther quite gone, or very much wasted and near
spenr.
My
My Ink, as I obscrv'd, had been gone for some
Time, all but a very little, which I eek'd out with
Water a little and a little, till it was so pale it
scarce left any Appearance of Black upon the Pa-
per: As lortg as it lasted I made Use of it to mi-
nute down the Days of the Month on which any
remarkable Thing happen'd to me j and sirst by
casting up Times past, I remember that there was
a strange Concurrence of Days in the various Pro-
vidences which besel me, and which, if I had been
superstitiously inclin'd to observe Days as Fatal oc
Fortunate, 1 might have had Reason to have
look'd upon with a great deal of Ciiriosity.
First, 1 had observ'd, that the same Day that I
broke away from my Father and roy Friends, and
run away to Hull in order to go to Sea, the fame
Day afterwards I was taken by the Salle Man of
War, and made a Slave.
The fame Day of the Year that I escap'd out
Pf the Wreck of that Ship in Yarmouth Roads,
that fame Day-Year afterwards 1 made my Escape
from Salle in the Boat.
The fame Day of the Year I was born on, (viz,.)
the 30th of Sepember, the fame Day I had my Life
so miraculously saved 2<5 Year after, when I was
cast on Shore in this Island; so that my wicked
Lise and solitary Lise began both on a Day.
The next Thing to my Ink's being wasted, was
that of my Bread, I mean the Biskct Which I
brbught out of the Ship : This I had husbanded
to the last Degree, allowing my self but one Cake
of Bread a Day, fof above a Year; and yet I
was quite without Bread for near a Year before
.1 got any Corn of my own ; and great Reason I
had to be thankful that I had any at all, the get-
ting it being, as has been already observed, next
to miraculous.
My Clothes began to decay too mightily: As
to Linncn, I had none a good while, except some
checqucr'd Shirts which I found in the Chests of the
other Seamen, and which I carefully preserv'd, be-
cause many Times I could bear no other Clothes
on but a Shirt; and it was a very great Help to me
that I had among all the Mens Clothes of the
Ship almost three Dozen of Shirts. There were al-
so several thick Watch Coats of theSeamens, which
Were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear;
and tho' it is true, that the Weather was so vio-
lent hot, that there was no need of Clothes, yet I
could not go quite naked, no, tho' I had been
inclined to it, which I was not, nor could abide
the Thoughts of it, tho' I was all alone.
The Reason why I could not go quite naked,
was, 1 conld not bear the Heat of the Sun so well
when quite naked, as with some Clothes on; nay,
the very Heat frequently blifier'd my Skin; where-
as with a Shirt on, the Air itself made some Mo-
tion, and whistling under that Shirt, was twofold
cooler than withoutit: No more could lever bring
myself to go out in the Heat of the Sun without a
Cap or Hac; the Heat of the Sun beating with
such Violence as it does in that Place, would give
me the Head-Ach presently, by darting so direct-
ly on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on; so
that I could not bear it; whereas if I put on
my Hat, it would presently go away.
Upon those Views I began to consider about put*
ting the sew Rags I had, which I call'd Clothes,
into some Order: I had worn out all the Waste-
coats I had, and my Business was now to try if I
could not make Jackets out of the great Watch-
Coats which I had by me, and with such other
Materials as I had ; so I set to work a Tayloring,
or rather indeed a Botching; for 1 made most
piteous
piteous Work of it. However, I made shift to
make twoor three new Wastecoats, which I hoped
would serve me a great while; as for Breeches or
Drawers, I made but very sorry shift indeed, till
afterward.
I have mentioned, that I saved the Skins of all
the Creatures that 1 kill'd, I mean four-footed ones,
and 1 had hung them up slretch'd out with Sticks
in the Sun, by which means some of them were so
dry and hard that they were fit for little,but others
it seems were very useful. The first thing 1 made
of these was a great Cap for my Head, with the
Hair on the Outside to shoot osf the Rain; and
this I perform'd so well, that after this 1 made me
a Suit of Clothes wholly of these Skins, that is to
fay, a Wasteeoat and Breeches open at Knees, and
both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep
me cool, than to keep me warm. 1 must not omit
to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made;
for if 1 was a bad Carpenter, I was a worse laykr.
However, they were such as I made very good
sl;ift with; and when I was abroad, if it happen'd
to Rain, the Hair of the Wastecoat and Cap be-
ing outermost, lwas kept very dry.
After this I spent a great deal of Time and Pains
to make me an Umbrella. I was indeed in great
Want of one, and had a great Mind to make one
1 had seen them make in the Brasils, where they are
very useful in the great Heats which are there:
And I selt the Heats every jot as great here, and
gteatertoo, being nearest the Equinox; besides,^
1 was much obliged to be abroad, it was a most
useful thing to me, as well for the Rains as the
Heats. I took a world of Pains at it, and was a
great while before 1 could make any thing likely to
hold; nay, after 1 thought I had hit the Way, I
spoilt 2 or 3 before 1 made one to roy Mind; but
at
at last I made one thatanswer'd indifferently well j
the main Difficulty I sound was to make it to let
down. I could make it to spread, but it did not
let down too, and draw in; it was not portable sor
me any Way but just over my Head, which would
not do. However, at last, as I said, 1 made one
to answer, and covered it with Skins, the Hair up-
wards, so that it cast off the Rain like a Pent-
house, and kept off the Sun so effectually, that I
could walk out in the hottest of the Weather, with
greater Advantage than I could before in the cool-
est, and when I had no Need os it, could close it
and carry it under my Arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind be-
ing entirely composed by resigning to the Will of
God, and throwing my self wholly upon the Dis*
posal of his Providence. This made my Lise bet-
ter then sociable ; sor when I began to regret the
want of Conversation, I would ask my self, whether
thus conversing mutually with my own Thoughts,
and as 1 hope I may fay, with even God himself
by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmost
^Enjoyment of human Society in the World?
i cannot fay, that after this, for five Years, any
extraordinary Thing happen'dto me, butlliv'don
in the fame Course, in the same Posture and Place,
as just before. The chief Thing I was employ'din,
besides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and
Rice, and curing my Raisins, of both which I al-
ways kept up just enough to have sufficient Stock
of one Year's Provisions beforehand; I fay, besides
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going
out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me
a Canoe, which at last I finished : So that by dig-
ing a Canal to it of six Foot wide» and four Foot
deep, I brought it into the Creek, almost half a
Mile. As sor the first, which was so vastly bi?,
at
as I made it without considering before-hand, as I
ought to do, how 1 should be able to launch it; so
never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring
the Water to it,- 1 was oblig'd to let it lie where it
was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wiser
next Time. Indeed the next Time, tho' I could
not get a Tree proper for it, and was in a Place
where I could not get the Water to it, at any less
Distance than as I have said, near half a Mile; yet
as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it
over; and though I was near two Years about it,
yet I never grudg'd my Labour, in Hopes of hay-
ing a Boat to go off to Sea at last.
However, tho' my little Periagua was finish'd,
yet the Size of it was not at all answerable to the
Design which I had in View, when I made the
first; I mean of venturing over to the Terra Firma,
where it was above forty Miles broad ; accor-
dingly, the Smalness of my Boat assisted to put an
End to that Design, and now 1 thought no more
of it: But as I had a Boat, my next Design was to
make a Tour round the Island; for as 1 had been
on the other Side, in one Place, crossing, as I have
already described it, over the Land ; so the Dis-
coveries I made in that little Journey, made me
very eager to see other Parts of the Coast ;and now
I had a Boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round
thelsland.
For this Purpose, that I might do every thing
with Discretion and Consideration, I fitted up a
little Mast to my Boat, and made a Sail to it out
of some of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay
in Store, and of which I had a great Stock by me.
Having fitted my Mast and Sail, and try'd the
Boat, 1 found shc would fail very well: Then I
made little Lockers or Boxes, at either End of my
Boat, to put Provisions, Necessaries, and Ammuni-
Part 1. M tion,
tion, ^Tc. into, to be kept dry, either from Rain,
or the Sprye of the Sea ; and a little long hollow
Place I cut in the Inside of the Boat, where I could
lay my Gun, making a Flag to hang down over
it to keep it dry.
I six'd my Umbrella also in a Step at the Stern,
like a Mast, to stand over my Head, and keep the
Heat of the Sun oft of me like an Auning; and
thus I every now and then took a little Voyage
upon the Sea, but never went far our, nor far from
the little Creek ; but at last being eager to view
the Circumserence of my litrle Kingdom, I resolv'd
upon my Tour, and accordingly 1 victuall'd my
Ship for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of
my Loaves, (Cakes I should rather call them) of
Barley Bread, an Earthern Pot full of parch'd Rice,
a Food I cat a great deal of, a little Bottle of
Rum, half a Goat, and Powder and Shot for kill-
ing more, and two large Watch-coats, of those
which, as I mention'd before, I had fav'd out of
the Seamens Chests; these I took, one to lie up-
on, and the other to cover me in the Night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth Year
of my Reign, or my Captivity, which you please,
that 1 set out on this Voyage, and I found it much
longer than I expected; for though the Island it-
self was not very large, yet when I came to the
East Side of it, I found a great Ledge of Rocks
lie out about two Leagues into the Sea, some a-
bove Water, some under it; and beyond that, a
'Shoal of Sand, lying dry half a League more ; so
that I was oblig'd to go a great Way out to Sea
to double the Point.
When sirstldiscover'd them, I was going to give
over my Enterprise, and come back agaiu, not
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
Sea; and above ail, doubting howl should setback
"again;
agairi; so I came to an Anchor, for I had made
me a kind of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken
Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.
Having secur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and
went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which
seetn'd to overlook that Poinc, where I saw the
full Extent of it, and resolv'd to venture.
In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where 1
stood, I percciv'd a strong, and indeed, a most fu-
rious Current, which run to the East, and evert
came close to the Point; and I took the more
Notice of it, because I saw there might be some
Danger, that when I came into it, I might be car-
ry 'd out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be
able to make the Island again; and indeed, had I
not gotten first up Upon this Hill, I believe it
would have been so; for there was the fame Cur-
rent on the other Side the Island, only that it set
off at a farther Distance; and I saw there was a
strong Eddy under the Shore; so I had nothing to
do but to get in out of the first Current, and t
should presently be in an Eddy.
I lay here, however, two Days; because the
Wind blowing pretty fresh at E. S. E. and that
being just contrary to the said Current, made a
gr«at Breach of the Sea upon the Point; so that
it was not sase for me to keep too close to the;
Shore for the Breach, nor to go too far off be-
cause of the Stream.
The third Day in the Morning, the Wind ha-
ving abated over Night, the Sea Was calm, and C
vtntur'd; but 1 am a Warning Piece again to alf
rash and ignorant Pilots ; for no sooner was I come
to the Point, when even I was not my Boat's
Length from the Shore, but I found my self in a
great Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice
°f a Mill: It carry *d my Boat along with it
i M i with
with such Violence, that all I could do; could not
keep her so much as on the Edge of it; but 1 sound
it hurry'd me farther and farther out from the Ed-
dy, which was on my Left Hand. There was no
Wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with
my Paddles signify *d nothing; and now I began to
give my self over for lost; for as the Current was
on both Sides the Island, I knew in asewLeagues
Distance they must join again, and then 1 was ir-
recoverably gone; nor did I see any possibility of
svoiding it; so that I had no Prospect before me
but of perishing; not by the Sea, for that was
calm enough, but of starving for Hunger. I had
indeed sound a Tortoise on the Shore, as big al-
most as 1 could lift, and had tofs'd it into the
Boat; and 1 had a great Jar of fresh Water, that is
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all
this to being driven into the vast Ocean, where, to
be sure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or
Island, for a thousand Leagues at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the Provi-
dence of God to make the most miserable Condi-
tion Mankind could be in, worse. Now I Iook'd
back upon my desolate solitary Island, as the most
pleasant Place in the World, and all the Happiness
my Heart could wish for, was to be but there
again. 1 stretch'd out my Hands to it with eager
Wishes. O happy Desart, said I, I shall never see
thee more! O miserable Creature, said I, whi-
ther am I going! Then 1 reproach'd my self with
my unthankful Temper, and how Iliad repin'd at
my solitary Condition; and now what would I give
to be on Shore there again? Thus we never see
the true State of our Condition, till it is illustrated
to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value
what we enjoy, but by the Want of it. It is scarce
possible to imagine the Consternation I was now in,
being
being driven from my beloved Island (for so it ap-
peared to me now to be) into the wide Ocean, al-
most two Leagues, and in the utrrfost Despair of
ever recovering it again. However I work'd hard
till indeed my Strength was almost exhausted, and
ltept my Boat as much to the Northward, that is,
towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy
liy on, as possibly as I could ; when about Noon, as
the Sun pass'd the Meridian, I thought 1 felt a lit-
tle Breeze of Wind in my Face, springing up from
the S. S. E. This chear'd my Heart a little, and
especially when in about half an Hour more it
blew a pretty small gentle Gale- By this Time [
was gotten at a frightful Distance from the Island,
and had the least Cloud or hazy Weather interven'd,
1 had been undone another Way too; for I had no
Compass on Board, and should never have known
how to have steer'd towards* the Island, if 1 had
but once lost Sight of it; but the Weather con'
tinuing clear, I apply'd my self to get up my Mast
again, spread my Sail, standing away to the North
as much as possible, to get out of the Current.
Just as 1 had set my Mast and Sail, and the Boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the Clear-
ness of the Water, some Alteration of the Current
was near; for where the Current was so strong, the
Water was foul; but perceiving the Water clear, I
found the Current abate, and presently I found to
the East, at about half a Mile, a Breach of the Sea
upon some Rocks; these Rocks 1 found caus'd the
Current to part again, and as the main Stress if it
ran away more Southerly, leaving the Rocks to the
North-East, so the other rcturn'd by the Repulse of
the Rocks, and made a strong Eddy, which ran
back again to the North W,,st with a very sl arp
Stream.
M 3 They
They who know what it is to have a Reprieve
brought to them upon the Ladder, or to be rescii-
cd from Thieves just going to murder them, or
who have been in such like Extremities, may guess
what my present Surprize of Joy was, and how
gladly I put my Boat intothe Stream of this Eddy,
and the Wind also freshening, how gladly I spread
my Sail to it, running chearfully before the Wind,
and with a strong Tide or Eddy under Foot.
This Eddy carry'd me about a League in my
Way back again directly towards the Island, but
about two Leagues more to the Northward than
the Current which carried me away at first ; so
that when I came near the Island, I found my self
open to the Northern Shore of it, that is to fay,
the other End of the Island opposite to that which
J went out from.
When I had made something more than a League
of Way by the Help of this Current or Eddy, I
found it was spent and serv'd me no farther. How-
ever, I sound that being between the two great
Currents, (viz,) that on the South Side, which
had hurried me away, and that on the North,
which layabout a League on the other Side: I fay,
between these two, in the Wake of the Island, I
found the Water at least still and running no Way;
and having still a Breeze of Wind fair for me, I
kept on steering directly for the Island, tho* npt
making such fresh Way as I did before.
About four a-Csockin the Evening, being then
within about a League of the Island, I found the
Point of the Rocks which occasion'd this Disaster,
stretching put, as is described before, to the South-
ward, and casting qti'the Current more Southward-
ly, had of course made another Eddy to theNprtn,
and this I sound Very strong, but not directly setting

almost
almost sals North. However, having a sresti
Gale, 1 slretch'd a-cross this Eddy slanting North-
West, and in about an Hour came within about a
Mile of the Shore, where it being smooth Water,
I soon got to Land.
When I was on Shore I sell on my Knees, and
gave'God Thanks for my Deliverance resolving ro
lay aside all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my
Boat; and refreshing my self with such Things as
I had, 1 brought my Boat close to the Shore in a.
little Cave that I had fpy'd under some Trees, and
laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the
Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.
I was now at a great Loss which Way to gee
Home with my Boat: I had run, so much Hazard,
and knew too much the Case to think of attempt-
ing it by the Way I went out ; and what might be
at the other Side, (I mean the West-Side) I knew
not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures,
so 1 only resolved in the Morning to make my Way
Westward along the Shore, and to see if there was
no Creek where I might lay up my Fregate in Sase-
ty, so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
threeMiles,or thereabout, coasting the Shore,!came
to a very good Inlet, or Bay, about a Mile over,
which narrow'd till itcameto a very little Rivulet
or Brook, where I found a very convenient Harbour
for my Boat, and where she lay as is she had been
in a little Dock made on purpose for her. Here I
putin, and having stow'd my Boat very sase, I went
on Shore to look abouc me, and see where 1 was.
1 soon found 1 had but a little pass'd by the Place
where I had been before, when I travell'd on. Foot
to that Shore ; so taking nothing out of my Boar,
but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was ex-
ceeding hot, 1 began my March. The Way was
comsortable enough after such a Voyage as 1 had
M 4 bectl
been upon, and I reach'd my old Bower in the
Evening, where I found every thing standing as I
left it; for I always kept it in good Order, being,
as I said before, my Country-house.
t got over the Fence, and laid me down in the
Shade to rest my Limbs, for I was very weary, and
sellasleep: Bur judge you, if you can, that read my
Story what a Surprize I must be in, when I was
wak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by
my Name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe,
poor Robin Crusoel where are you Robin Crusoe?
Where are you? Where have you been?
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigu'd with
Rowing, or Paddling, as ir is call'd, the first
Part of the Day, and with Walking the latter
Parr, that 1 did not wake throughly; but dozing
between sleeping and waking, thought 1 dream'd
that some body spoke to me; But as the Voice
continu'd to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at
last I began to wake more persectly, and was at
first dreadfully frighted, and started up in the ut-
most Consternation: But no sooner were my Eyes
open, but 1 saw my Poll sitting on the Top of the
Hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that
spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning Language
I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and he
had learn'd it so persectly, that he would fit upon
my Finger, and lay his Bill close to my Face, and
cry, Poor Robin Crusoe, Where are you} Where have
you been? How came you here? and luch things as I
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the Parrot,
and that indeed it could be no body else, it was
a good while before I could compose my self.
First, I was amazed how the Creature got thither,
and then how he should just keep about the Place,
and no where else: But as I was well satisfied it
could
[ i69-3
could be no body but honest Poll, I got it over;
and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his
Name Poll, the sociable Creature came to me, and
sat upon my Thumb, as he used to do, and conti-
nued talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and how
did 1 come here? And where had I been? Just as
if he had been overjoy'd to see me again ; and so
I carry'd him Home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for
some time, and had enough to do for many Days
to fit still, and reslect upon the Danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had
my Boat again on my Side of the Island; but I
knew not how it was practicable to get it about.
As to the East Side of the Island, which I had
gone round, I knew well enough there was no ven-
turing that Way; my very Heart would shrink,
and my very Blood run chill but to think of it:
And as to the other Side of the Island, I did not
know how it might be there; but supposing the
Current ran with the same Force against the Shore
at the East, as it pass'd by it on the other, I might
run the fame Risk of being driven down the
Stream, and carry'd by the island, as I had been
before, of being carry'd away from it; so with these
Thoughts I contented my self to be without any
Boat, tho' it had been the Product of so many
Months Labour to make it, and of so many more
to get it unto the Sea.
In this Government of my Temper I remain'd
near a Year, lived a very sedate retired Lise, as
you may well suppose; and my Thoughts being
very much composed as to my Condition, and
mlly comforted in resigning my self to the Dis-
positions of Providence, 1 thought I Iiv'd really ve-
ry happily in all things, except that of Society.
1 inv
I improv'd my self in this Time in all the me-
chanick Exercises which my Necessities put me up-
on applying my self to, and I believe could, upon
Occasion, have made a very good Carpenter, espe-
cially considering how sew Tools I had.
Besides this, I arriv'd at an unexpected Per-
section in my Earrhen Ware, and contrived well
enough to make them with a Wheel, which I found
infinitely easier and better ; because I made Things
round and shapeablc, which before were filthy
Things indeed to look on. But I think I was ne-
ver more vain of my own Performance, or more
joyful for any Thing I found our, than for my be-
ing able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was
a very ugly clumsy Thing, when it was done, and
only burnt red like other Earthen Ware, yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoak, I
was exceedingly comforted with it; for Ihad been
always used to Smoak, and there were Pipes in
the Ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
that there was Tobacco in the Island; and after-
wards, when I scarch'd the Ship again, I could
not come at any Pipes at all.
in my Wicker-ware also I improved much, and
made Abundance of necessary Baskets, as well as
my Invention sbew'd me, though not very hand-
some, yet they were such as were very handy and
convenient formy laying Things up in, or setching
Things home in. For Example, if I kill'd a Goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a Tree, slea it, and
dress it, and cut it in Pieces, and brisig it home in
a Basket; and the like by a Turtle, 1 could cut it
up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of the
Flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them
horde in a Basket, and leave the rest behind
me. Also large deep Baskets were my Recei-
vers for my Corn, which I always rubb'd out as
soon
soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in
great Baskets.
1 began now to perceive my Powder abated
considerably, and this was a Want which it was
impossible for me to supply, and 1 began seriously
to consider what I must do when I should have no
more Powder ; that is to fay, how I should do to
kill any Goats. I had, as is observ'd in the thirds
Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and
bred her up came, I was in hopes of getting a
He-Goat, but I could noc by any means bring it
to pass, till my Kid grew an old Goat; and I
could never find in my Heart to kill her, till she
dy'd at last of meer Age.
But being now in the eleventh Year of my Re-
sidence, and, as I have said, my Ammunition grow-
ing low, I set my self to study some Art to trap
and snare the Goats, to, see whether I could not
catch some of them alive, and particularly I want-
ed a She-Goat great with Young.
To this Purpose I made Snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken
in them; but my Tackle was not good, for I had
no Wire, and I always found them broken, and
my Bait devour'd.
At length I resolv'd to try a Pit-fall, so T dug
several large Pits in the Earth, in Places where I
had observ'd the Goats used to ,esd, and over these
Pits I placed Hurdles of my own making too,
with a great Weight upon them; and several times
J put Ears of Barley and dry Rice, without set-
ting the Trap, and I could easily perceive that the
Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for J
could see the Mark of their Feet. At length I fee
three Traps in one Night, and going the next
Morning I found them all standing, and yet the
Bait eaten and gone. This was very discouraging J
Hovj-
However, I alter'd my Traps, and, not to trouble
you with Particulars, going one Morning to see
my Traps, I found in one of them a large old He-
Goat, and in one of the other three Kids, a Male
and two Females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him, he was so fierce I durst not go into the Pit
to him; that is to fay, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what I wanted. I could
have kill'd him, but tli3t was not my Business, nor
would it answer my End. So I e'en let him out,
and he ran away as if he had been frighted out of
his Wits: But I had forgot then what I had
learned afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lion.
If I had let him stay there three or four Days with-
out Food, and then have carry'd him some Water
to drink, and then a little Corn, he would have
been as tame as one of the Kids, for they are
mighty sagacious tractable Creatures where they
are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, know-
ing no better at that time; then 1 went to the
three Kids, and taking them one by one, I ty'd
them with Strings together, and with some Diffi-
culty brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would seed, but
throwing them some sweet Corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame: And now I found that
if I expected to supply my self with Goat Flesh,
when I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding
some up tame was my only Way, when perhaps
I might have them about my House like a Flock
of Sheep.
But then it presently occur'd to me, that I must
keep the Tame from the Wild, or else they would
always run wild when they grew up ; and the only
Way for this was to have some enclosed Piece of
Ground,
Ground, well senc'd either with Hedge or Pale, to
keep them in so essectually, that those within
might not breakout, or those without break in.
This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of
Hands; yet as I saw there was an absolute Neces.
fity of doing it, my first Piece of Work was to
find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz, where
there was likely to be Herbage for rhem to ear,
Water for them to drink, and Cover to keep them
from the the Sun.
Those who understand such Enclosures will
think I had very little Contrivance, when Ipitch'd
Upon a Place very proper for all these, being a
plain open Piece of Meadow-Land or Savanna,
(as our People call it in the Western Colonies,)
which had two or three lirtle Drills of fresh Warer
in it, and at one end was very woody: 1 fay
they will smile at my Forecast, when I shall rell them
I began my enclosing of this Piece of Ground in
such a Manner, that my Hedge or Pale must have
been at least two Mile about. Nor was the Mad-
ness of it so great as tothe Compass, for if it was
ten Mile about 1 was like to have time enough to
do it in. But I did not consider rhat my Goats
would be as wild in so much Compass, as if they
had had the whole Island, and I should have so
much Room to chafe them in, that 1 should never
catch them.
My Hedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe,
about fifty Yards, when this Thought occur'd ro
me; so I presently stopt short, and for rhe first Be-
ginning I resolv'd to inclose a Piece of about i jo
Yards in Length, and ioo Yards in Breadth, which
as it would maintain as many as I should have
in any reasonable Time, so as my Flock encreased,
I could add more Ground to my Enclosure.
This
This was acting with some Prudence, and I
went to work with Courage. I was about three
Months hedging in the first Piece, and till I had
done it I tethcr'd the three Kids in the best Part of
it, and us'd them to seed as near me as possible to
make them familiar; and very often I would go and
carry them some Ears of Barley, or a Handful
of Rice, and seed them out of my Hand ; so that
after my Inclosure was sinish'd, and I let them
loose, they would follow me up and down, bleat'
ing after me for a handful of Corn.
Thisanfwer'd my End, and in aboutaYearand
Half 1 had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids,
and all; and in two Years more I had three and
forty, besides several that I took and kill'd for my
Food. And aster that I inclosed five several
Pieces of Ground to seed them in, with little
Penns to drive them into, to take them as I want-
ed, and Gates out of one Piece of Ground into
another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had
Goats Flesii to seed on when I pleas'd, but Milk
too, a Thing which indeed in my Beginning I did
not so much as think of, and which, when it came
into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Sur-
prize. For now I set up my Dairy, and had some-
times a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every
Creature, dictates even naturally how to make use
of it ; so 1 that had nevermilk'daCow, much less
a Gpar, or seen Butter or Cheese made, very rea-
dily and handily, tho' after a great many Essays
and Miscarriages, made me both Butter and Cheese
at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
Creatures, even in those Conditions in which they
scem'd to be over-whelm'd in Destruction ! How
can
can he sweeten the bitterest Providences* and give"
us Cause to praise him for Dungeons and Prisons 1
What a Table was here spread for me in a Wil-
derness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish
for Hunger J
It would have made a Stoick smile to have seen
me and my little Family lit down to Dinner ; there
was my Majesty, the Prince and Lord of the whole
Island: I had the Lives of all my Subjects at my
absolute Command. I could hang, draw, give
Liberty, and take it away, and no Rebels among
all my Subjects.
Then to see how like a King I din'd too all a-
lone, attended by my Servants; Poll, as if he had
been my Favourite, was the only Person permit-
ted to talk to me. My Dog, who was now grown
very old and crazy, and had found no Species to
multiply his Kind upon, fat always at my Righc
Hand; and two Cats, one on one Side the Ta-
ble, and one on the other, expecting now and
then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of special
Favour.
But these were not the two Cats which I brought
on Shore at first, for they were both of them dead,
and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my
own Hand; but one of them having multiply*d
by I know not what Kind of Creature, these were
two which I had preserv'd tame, whereas the rest
run wild in the Woods, and became indeed trou-
blesome to me at last; for they would often
come into my House, and plunder me too, till at
last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a
great many ; at length they left me with this At-
tendance; and in this plentiful Manner I liv'd;
neither could I be said to want any Thing but
Society, and of that in some time after this I was
hke to have too much.
I was
i
I was something impatient, as I have observ'd,
to hav« the Use of my Boat, though very loath to
run any more Hazards; and therefore sometimes I
fat contriving Ways to get her about the Island,
and at other times 1 fat my self down contented
enough,with her. But 1 had a strange Uneasiness in
my Mind to go down to the Point of the Island,
where, as I have said, in my last Ramble, I went
up the Hill to see how the Shore lay, and how the
Current set, that I might see what 1 had to do.
This Inclination increased uponmeevery Day,and
at length I resolved to travel thither by Land; fol-
lowing the Edge of the Shore I did so; But had any
one in England been to meet such a Man as I was, it
must either have frighted them, or raised a great
deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to
look at my self, 1 could not but smile at the Noti-
on of my travelling thro' York/hire with such an
Equipage, and in such a Dress. Be pleased to take
a Sketch of my Figure as follows.
1 had a great high shapeless Cap, made of a
Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind,
as well to keep the Sun from me, as to shoot the
Rain off from running into my Neck; nothing
being so hurtful in these Climates, as the Rain
upon the Flesh under the Clothes.
I had a short Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts
coming down to about the Middle of my Thighs;
and a Pair of open-kneed Breeches of the fame; the
Breeches were made of theSkin of an old He-goat,
whose Hair hung down such a Length on either
Side, that like Pantaloons it reach'd to the Middle
of my Legs. Stockings and Shoes I had none, but
1 had made me a Pair of something, I scarce know
what to call them, like Buskins, to slap over my
Legs, and lace on either Side like Spatterdashers;
but of a most barbarous Shape, as indeed were all
the rest of my Cloaths.
1 had on, a broad Belt of Goat's Skin dry'd,
which I drew together with two Thongs of the
fame, instead of Buckles, and in a kind of a Frog
on either Side of this, instead of a Sword and a
Dagger, hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on
one Side, one on the other. I had another Belt not
so broad, and fasten'd in the same manner, which
hung over my Shoulder; and at the End of it,
under my lest Arm hung two Pouches, both made
of Goat's Skin too; in one of which hung my
J?owder, in the other my Shot: At my Back I car-
ried my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over
my Head a great clumsy ugly Goat-Skin Umbrello,
but which', after all, was the most necessary thing
I had about trie, next to my Gun: As sbr my Face,
the Colour of it was really not so Moletta like as
one might expect from a Man not at all careful of
it, and living within 9 or 10 Degrees of theEquinox.
. My Beard t had once sufter'd to grow till it was
about a Quarter of a Yard long; but as I had both
Sciffars and Razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty
short, except what grew on my upper Lip, which
I had trimm'd into' a large Pair of Mahometan
Whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some.. 'Turks,
whom I saw at Sallee, for the Moors did not wear
such, tho' the Turks did; of these Mustachioes, or
Whiskers, I will not fay they were long enough to
hang my Hat upon them, but they were .of a-
Length and Shape monstrous enough, and such as
in England would have pass'd for frightful.
But all this is by the by; for as to miy Figure, I
had so sew to observe me, that it was of no man-
ner of Consequence; so I say no more to that Part.
In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey, and
was out five or six Days. I travell'd first along the
Parti. N 'Sea'
Sea-Shore, directly to the Place where I first brought
my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks;
and having no Boat now to take care of, I went o-
ver the Land a nearer Way, to the fame Height
that I was upon before; when looking forward to
the Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which
I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as i said a-
bove, I was furpriz'd to see the Sea all smooth and
quiet, no Rippling, no Motion, no Current, any
more there than in other Places.
I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and
refolv'd to spend some Time in the observing it, to
see if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occa-
sion' d it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was,
vdc. That the Tide of Ebb setting from the Weft,
and joyning with the Current of Waters from some
great River on the Shore, must be the Occasion of
this Current - and that according as the Wind blew
more forcibly from the West, or from the North, this
Current came near, or went farther from the Shore:
for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went up to
the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb being
made, 1 plainly saw the Current again as before,
only, that it ran farther off, being near half a
League from the Shore; whereas in my Case, it
set close upon the Shore, and hurried me and my
Canoe along with it, which at another Time it
would not have done.
This Observation convinc'd me, That I had no-
thing to do but to observe the Ebbing and the
Flowing of the Tide, and I might very easily bring
my Boat about the Island again: But when I be-
gan to think of putting it in Practice, I had such a
Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of
the Danger I had been in, that I cou'dnot think of
it again with any Patience ; but on the contrary, I
took up another Resolution-, which was more sase,
'though
though more laborious; and this was, That I
would build, or rather make me another Penagua,
or Canoe; and so have one for one Side of the Island,
and one for the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I
may call it, two Plantations in the Island; one my
little Fortisication or Tent, with the Wall about
it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me,
which by this Time I had enlarg'd into several
Apartments or Caves, one within another. One
of these, which was the dry est, and largest, and
had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortisication;
that is to fay, beyond where my Wall join'd to
the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen
Pots, of which I have given an Account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold
five or six Bushels each, where 1 laid up my Stores
of Provision, especially my Corn, some in the Ear
cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubb'd
out with my Hand.
As for my Wall made, as before, with long Stakes
or Piles, those Piles grew all like Trees, and were
by this Time grown so big, and spread so very
much, that there was not the least Appearance to
any one's View of any Habitation behind them.
Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my
two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and sow'd, and which duly yielded me
their Harvest in its Season; and whenever I had
Occasion for more Corn, I had more Land adjoin-
I . mg as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had
now a tolerable Plantation there also; for first, I
had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept
W Repair; that is to fay, I kept the Hedge which
circled it inconstantly fitted up to its usual Height,
t^t - the
t
the Ladder standing always in the inside; I kept
the Trees which at first were no more than my
Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall; I
kept them always so cut, that they might spread
and grow thick and wild; and make the more agree-
able Shade, which they did essectually to my Mind.
In the middle os this I had my Tent always stand-
ing, being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up
for that Purpose, and which never wanted any re-
pair or renewing; and under this I had made me
a Squab or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures
I had kill'd, and with other soft Things, and a
Blanket laid on them, such as bclong'd to our Sea-
Bedding, which I had saved, and a great Watch-
Coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had oc-
casion to be absent from my chief Seat, I took up
my Country Habitation.
Adjoyning to this I had my Enclosures for my
Cattle, that is to fay, my Goats: And as I had
taken an inconceivable deal of pains to sence and
enclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it
kept entire, lest the Goats mould break thro', that
I never left osf, till with infinite Labour 1 had stuck
the Outside of the Hedge so full of small Stakes,
and so near to one another, that it was rather a
Pale than a Hedge, and there was scarce room to
put a Hand thro' between them, which afterwards
when those Stakes grew, as they all did in the next
rainy Season made the Enclosure strong, like a
Wall, indeed stronger than any Wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle,
and that I spared no Pains to bring to pass what-
ever appearM necessary for my comfortable Sup-
port; for I consider'd the keeping up a Breed of
tame Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a li-
ving Magazine of Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese,
far me as long as, I liv'd in the Place, if it were to
be forty Years, and that keeping them in my
Reach, depended entirely upon my persecting my
Enclosures to such a degree, that I might be sure
pf keeping them together; which by this Method
indeed I so essectually secured, that when these
little Stakes began to grow, I had planted them
so very thick, l was forced to. pull some of them
up again.
In this Place also I had my Grapes growing,
which I principally depended on for my Winter
Store of Raisins, and which I neyer fail'd to pre-
serve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable
Dainty of my whole Diet; and indeed they were
nqt agreeable only, but physical, wholesome, nou-
rishing and refreshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half way between my
other Habitation and the Place where I had laid
up my Boar, I generally stay'd and lay here in my
Way thither; for I used frequently to visit my
Boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to
her in very < good Order; sometimes I went out
in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous
Voyageswould I go,nor scarce ever above a Stone's
Cast or two from the Shore, I was so apprehen-
sive of being hurried out of my Knowledge again
by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Accident:
But now I come to a new Scene of my Lite.
It happen'd one Day about ]Ssoon,gaing towards
my Boat, I was exceedingly surpriz'd with the Print
of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was
very plain to be seen in the Sand: I stood like one
Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an Apparition;
I listen'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing,
nor see any thing; 1 went up to a. rising Ground tQ
look farther: I went up the Shore, and down the
Shore, but it was all one, I could see no other
'N"«'' Impressio*
Impression but that one, I went to it again to see
if there were, any more, and to observe if it might
not be my/Fancy; but there was no Room for
that, for there was exactly the very Print of a Foot,
Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it
came thither, 1 know not, nor could in the least
imagine. But after innumerable fiutteringThoughts,
like a Man persectly confused and out of- myself, I
came home to my Fortisication, not seeling, as we
fay, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last
degree, looking behind me at every two or three
Steps, mistaking every Bush and Tree, and fancy-
ing every Stump at a distance to be a Man; nor is
it possible to describe how many various Shapes a-
frighted Imagination represented things to me in;
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable
Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the Way.
When I came to my Castle, for fa I think I call'd
ir ever after this, I sled into it like one pursued;
whether I went over by the Ladder, as first con-
trived, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which
I call'd a Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could
I remember the next Morning; for never frighted
Hare sled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more
Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat.
I slept none that Night; the farther I was from
the Occasion of my Fright, the greater my Ap-
prehensions were; which is something contrary to
the nature of such things, and especially to the
usual Practice of all Creatures in Fear: But I was
so embarrass'd with my own frightful Ideas of the
thing, that I form'd nothing but dismal Imagina-
tions to myself, even tho' I was now a great way
toft if.''' Sometimes I fancy'd it must be the De-
vil; and Reason j'din'd in with me upon this Sup-
jposidon: For how should any other thing in hu-
-' man
man Shape come into the Place ? Where was the
Vessel that brought them? What Marks was there
of any other Footsteps? And how was it possible
a Man should come there ? But then to think that
Satan should take human Shape upon him in such a
Place where there could be no manner of Occasion,
for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind
him,and that even for no Purpose too (for he could
not be sure I should see it) this was an Amusement
the other Way: I consider'd that the Devil' might
have found out Abundance of other Ways to have
terrify'd me, than this of the single Print of a' Foot.
That as I liv'd quite on the otherside of the Island,
he would never have been so simple to leave a Mark
in a Place where it was ten Thousand to One whe-
ther I should ever see it or not, and in the Sand
too, which the first Surge of the Sea upon a high
Wind would have defac'd entirely : AH this seem'd
inconsistent with the Thing itself, and with, all
the Notions we usually entertain of the Subtilty
of the Devil.
Abundance of such Things as these assisted to ar-
gue me out of all Apprehensions of its being the
Devil: And I presently concluded then, that it must
be some more dangerous Creature, viz,. That it
must be some of the Savages of the main Land
over-against me, who had wandered out to Sea iti
their Canoes, and either driven by the Currents, or
by contrary Winds, had made the Island; and had
been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea,
being as loth, perhaps, to have staid in this deso-
late Island, as I would have been to have had them.
While these Reslections were rolling upon my
Mind, I was very thankful in my Thoughts, that
I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that
Time, or that they did not see my Boat, by which
they would have concluded that some Inhabitants
N 4 had
had been in the Place, and perhaps have scarch'd
farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my
Imagination about their having found my Boat,
and that there were People here; and that if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater
Numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen
so that they should not find me, yet they would
find my Enclosure, destroy all my Corn, carry away
all my Flock of tame Goats, and I should perish at
last for meer Want.
Thus my Fear banisji'd all my Religious Hope,
all that former Confidence in Go4, which was
founded upon such wonderful Experience as I had
had of his Goodness, now vanish'd; as if he that
had sed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preserve
by his Power the Provision which he had made for
me by his Goodness. I reproach'd myself with my
Easiness, thaf would not sow any more Corn one
Year than would Just serve me till the next Season,
as if no Accident could intetvene to prevent my
enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground;
and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd
for the future to have two or three Years Corn he*
fore-hand, so that whatever might come, I might
not perish for want of Bread.
How strange a Chequer-Work of Providence is
the Lise of Man! and by what secret dissering
Springs are the Affections hurried about, as differ-
ing Circumstances present! To Day we love what
to Morrow we hate; to Day we seek what to Mor-
row we shun; to Day we desire what to Morrow
"we sear ; nay, even tremble at the Apprehensions of.
This was exemplified in me at this Time in the
most lively Manner imaginable; for T, whose only
Affliction was, that T seem'd banish'd from human
Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd by the
boundless Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and con-
demn'd
demn'd to what I call silent Lise ; that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
ber'd among the Living, or to appear among the
rest of his Creatures; that to have seen one of my
own Species, would have scem'd , tp me a Raising
me from Death to Lise, and the greatest Blessing
that Heaven itself, next to the supreme Blessing of
Salvation, could bestow; J say, that I should now
tremble at the very Apprehensions of seeing a Man,
and was ready to sink into the Ground at but the
Shadow, or silent Appearance of a Man's having
set his Foot on the Island.
Such is the uneven State of Human Life ; and it
asforded me a great many curious Speculations af-
terwards, when I had a little recovered my first
Surprize ; I considered that this was the Station of
Lise, the infinitely wife and good Providence of
God had determin'd for me; that as I could not
foresee what the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be
in all this, so I was not to dispute his Sovereignty,
who, as I was his Creature^ had an undoubted
Right by Creation, to govern and dispose of me
absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a
Creature who had offended him, had likewise a
judicial Right to condemn me to what Punishment
he thought fit; and that it was my Part to submit
to bear his Indignation, because I had sinn'd a-
gainst him. .'
I then reslected, rhat God, who was not only
Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had thought fit
thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to
deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do it,
twas my unquestion'd Duty to resign myself abso-
lutely and entirely to his Will f And on the other
hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him, pray
to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and
Directions of his daily Providence.
These
These Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days,
nay, I may fay, Weeks and Months; and one par-
ticular Esfect of my Cogitations on this Occasion,
1 cannot omit, viz,. One Morning early, lying in
my Bed, and fill'd with Thoughts about my Dan-
ger from the Appearance of Savages, I found it
di/compos'd me very much; upon which those
Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts,
CaB upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I wiB deliver,
and thou Jhalt glorify me. .;
Upon this, rising chearfully out of my Bed, my
Heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for De-
liverance: When I had done praying, I took up
my Bible, and opening it to read, the first Words
that presented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and
be of good Cheer, and he jhall strengthen thy Heart;
.wait, I fay, on the Lord. It is impossible to express
the Comfort this gave me. In Answer, I thank-
fully laid down the Book, and was no more fad,
at least, not on that Occasion.
In the Middle of these Cogitations, Apprehen-
sions, and Reslections, it came into my Thought one
Day, that all this might be a meer Chimera of my
own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my
own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat:
This chear'd me up a little too, and I began to per-
fwade myself it was all a Delusion; that it was no-
thing else but my own Foot; and why might not I
come that Way from the Boat, as well as I was go-
ing that Way to the Boat ? Again, I consider'd also
that I could by no Means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not; and chat if at last
this was only the Print of my own»Foot, I had
play'd the Part of those Fools, who strive to make
Stories of Spectres and Apparitions, and then are ,
frighted at them more than any body. .
.'».-..:-.-' Now
Now I began to take Courage, and to peep a"
broad again; tor 1 had not stirr'd out of my Castl0
for three Days and Nights; so that I began t.
starve for Provision; for I had little or nothin^
within Doors, but some Barley Cakes and Water.
Then I knew that my Goats wanted to be milk'd
too, which usually was my Evening Diversion and
the poor Crearures were in great Pain and Inconve-
nience for want of it; and indeed it almost spoil'd
erne of them, and almost dry'd up their Milk.
Hearming myself therefore with the Belief that
this was nothing but the Print of one of my own
Feet, (and so I might be truly said t<y start at my
own Shadow ) I began to go abroad again, and
went to my Country-House to milk my Flock; but
to see with what Fear I went forward, how often I
look'd behind me, how I was ready every now- and
then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Lise, it
would have made any one have thought I was haunt-
ed with an evil Conscience, or that I had been late^
ly most terribly frighted; and so indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
Days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a lit-
tle bolder, and to think there was really nothing in
it but my own Imagination; but I could not per-
swade myself fully of this, till I jn'ould go down to
the Shore again, and see this Print of a Foot, and
measore it by my own, and see if there was any Si-
militude or Fitness, that I might be assur'd it was
my own Foot s; But when I came to the Place,
first, it appear'd evidently to me, that when I laid
up my Boat, I could not possibly be on Shore any
where thereabout: Secondly, when I came to mea-
sure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foor
not so large by 3 great deal; both these things fill'd
*y Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the
Vapours again to the highest degree; so that I
»a-—- stoofe
snook wit" Cold, like one in an Ague, and I went
Home again, fill'd with the Belief that some Man
or Men had been on Shore there; or, in short, that
the Island was inhabited, and I might be surpriz'd
before I was aware; and what Course to take for
ipy Security, I knew not.
O what ridiculous Resolutions Men take, when
posless'd with Fear! it deprives them of the Use of
those Means which Reason osfers for their Relief.
The first thing I proposed to myself was, to
thtow down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame
Cattel wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might
not find them, and then frequent the Island in Pro-
spect of the same, or the like Booty; then to the
simple thing of digging up my two Corri-Fields,
that they mi^ht not find such a Grain there, and
still be prompted to frequent the Island; then to
demolish my Bower and Tent, that they might
not see any Vestiges of Habitation, and be prompt-
ed to look further, in order to find out the Persons
inhabiting.
These were the Subject of the first Night's Co-
gitation, after I was come home again, while the
Apprehensions which had so over-run my Mind
were fresh upon me, and my Head was full of Va-
pours, as above. Thus Fear of Danger is ten thou-'
sand times more terrifying than Danger itself,
when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Bur-:
den of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil
which we are anxious about; and,, which was worse
than all this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble
from the Resignation I used to. practise, that I
hoped to have. I look'd, I thought, like Saul, who
complain'd not only that the Philistines were upon
him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not.
now take due ways to compose my Mind, by crying
%o God in my Distress, and resting upon his Provi-
dence,
dence, as I had done before, for my Desence and
Deliverance ; which if I had done, I had, ar least
been more cheerfully supported under this new Sur-
prize, and perhaps carry'd through it with more
Resolution.
This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking
all Night; but in the Morning I sell asleep, and
having, by the Amusement of my Mind, been as
it were tired, and my Spirits exhausted, I slept ve-
ry soundly, and wak'd much better compos'd than
I had ever been before: .And now 1 began to think
sedately; and upon the utmost Debate with my-
self, I concluded, That this Island, which was so
exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the
main Land than as I had seen, was not so entirely
abandon'd as I might imagine : That altho' there
were no stated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot;
yet that there might sometimes come Boats off
from the Shore, who either with Design, or per-
haps never, but when they were driven by cross.
Winds, might come to this Place.
That I had liv*d here fifteen Years now, and had
not met with the least Shadow or Figure of any
People yet; and that if at any Time they should
. be driven here, it was probable they went away
again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had
never thought fit to fix there upon any Occasion,
to this Time.
That the most I cou'd suggest any Danger from,
was, from any such casual accidental Landing of
straggling People from the Main, who, as it was
likely if they were driven hither, were here against
their Wills; so they made no stay here, but went off
again with all possible Speed, seldom staying one
Night on Shore, lest they should not have the
Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again Aand
that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider
3 of
of some sase Retreat, in Case I should see any Sa-
vages land upon the Spot.
Now I began sorely to repenr, that I had dug
my Cave so large, as to bring a Door through
again, which Door, as I said, came out beyond
were my Fortisication joyn'd to the Rock: Upon
maturely considering this therefore, I resolv'd to
draw me a second Fortisication, in the same Man-
ner of a Semicircle, at a Distance from my Wall,
just where I had planted a double Row of Trees
about twelve Years before, of which 1 made men-
tion: These Trees having been planted so thick
before, there wanted but a sew Piles to be driven
between them, that they should be thicker, and
stronger, and my Wall would be soon finish'd.
So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer
Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Ca-
bles, and every thing.I could think of to make it
strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as
big as I might put my Arm out at. In the Inside
of this I thickned my Wall to about ten Foot
thick, with continually bringing Earth out of my
Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
walking upon it ; and through the seven Holes, I
contriv'd to plant the Musquets, of w hich I took
Notice, that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship;
these, I say, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted
them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
that so I could fire all the seven Guns in two Mi-
nutes time: This Wall I was many a weary Month
a finishing, and yet never thought my self sase till
it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the Ground
without my Wall, for a great way every way, as
full with Stakes or Sticks of the Ofier-\ikt Wood,
which I found so apt to grow, as they could well
stand; insomuch, that I believe 1 might set in near
twenty
twenty Thousand of them, leaving a pretty large
Space between them and my Wall, that I might
have Room to see an Enemy, and they might have
no Shelter from the young Trees, if they attempt-
ed to approach my outer Wall.
Thus in two Years time I had a thick Grove,
and in five or Six Years time I had a Wood before
my Dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and
strong, that it was indeed persectly impassable; and
no Men, of what kind soever, would ever imagine
that there was any Thing beyond it, much less a
Habitation. As for the Way which I proposed to
myself to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it
was by setting two Ladders ; one to a Part of the
Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left
room to place another Ladder upon that; so when
the two Ladders were taken down, no Man living
could come down to me without mischieving him-_.
self: and if they had come down, they were still
on the Outside of my outer Wall.
Thus I took all the Measures human Prudence
could suggest for my own Preservation ; and it wist
be seen at length, that they were not altogether
without just Reason ; though I foresaw nothing at
that Time, more than my meer Fear suggested to
me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether care-
less of my other Affairs ; for I had a great Concern
upon me for my little Herd of Goats; they were
not only a present Supply to me upon every Occasi-
on, and began to be sufficient to me, without the
Expence of Powder and Shot, but also without
the Fatigue of Hunting after the wild ones ; and I
was loth to lose the Advantage of them, and to
have them all to nurse up over again.
To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I
could think of but two Ways to preserve them;
one
one was to find another convenient Place to dig i
Cave under Ground, and td drive them into it eve-
ry Night; and the other was to enclose two or
three little Bits or' Land, remote from one another,
and as much conceal'd as I could, where 1 might
keep about half a dozen young Goats in each Piace:
bo chat if any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in ge-
neral:, I might be able to raise them again with lit-
tle Trouble and Time: And this, tho' it would
require a great deal of Time and Labour, 1 thought
was the most rational Design.
Accordingly, J spent some Time to find out the
most retired Parts of the Jliand; and 1 pitch'd up;
on one which was as private indeed as my Heart,
could Wijh for; it was a little damp Piece of
Ground in the middle of the hollow and thick
Woods, where, as is observ'd, I almost lost myself
once before, endeavouring to come back that way
frdm the Eastern Part of the island: Here 1 found
a clear Piece of Land near three Acres, lo sur-
rounded with Woods, that it was almost an En-
closure by Nature, at least it did not want near so
much Labour to make it lo, as the other Pieces ot
Ground I had work'd so hard at.
I immediately went to work with this Piece of
Ground, and in less than a Month's time, I had
so senced it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it
which you please, who were not so wild now as
at first they might be supposed to be, were well
enough secured in it. So without any farther De-
lay, I removed ten She Goats and two He-Goats
to this Piece; and when they were there, I conti-
nued to persect the Fence till I had made it as ser
cure as the other, which, however, I did at more
Leisure, and it took me up more Time by a great
deal.
All
All this Labour I was at the Expence of, purely
from roy Apprehensions on the Account of the
Print of a Man's Foot which I had seen; for as yet
I never saw any human Creature come near the
IQand, and I had now liv'd two Years under these
Uneasinesses, which indeed made my Lise much less
comfortable than it was before; as may well be
imagin'd by any who know what it is to live in
the constant Snare of the Fear of Man; and this I
must observe with Grief too, that the Discompo-
sure of my Mind had too great Impressions also up-
on the religious Part of my Thoughts,for the Dread
and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages
and Canibals lay so upon my Spirits, that I seldom
found myself in a due Temper for Application to
my Maker, at least not with the sedate Calmness
and Resignation of Soul which I was wont to do; I
rather pray'd to God as under great Affliction and
Pressure of Mind, surrounded with Danger, and in
Expectation every Night of being murder'd and de-
vour'd before Morning; and I must testify from my
Experience,that a Temper of Peace.Thankfulness,
Love and Assection, is much the more proper Frame
for Prayer than that of Terror and Discomposure;
and that under the Dread of Mischief impending,
a Man is more fit for a comforting Performance
of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for Re-
pentance on a Sick-bed: For these Discomposures
asfect the Mind as the others do the Body; and
the Discomposure of the Mind must necessarily be
as great a Disability as that of the Body, and
much greater, praying to God being properly an
Act of the Mind, not of the Body.
But to go on ; After I had thus secur'd one Part
of my little living Stock, I went about the whole
Island, searching for another private Place, to make
Part L 'f O such
such another Deposit; when wandrjng more to the.
West Point of the Island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to Sea, I thought I saw a Boat up-
on the Sea, at a great Distance. I had found a
Prospective-Glass, or two, in one of the Seamen's
Chests, which I sav'd out of our Ship; but I had
it not about me, and this was so remote, that I
could not tell what to make of it, tho' I look'd
at it till my Eyes were not able to hold to look
any longer ; whether it was a Boat, or not, I do
not know; but as I descended from the Hill, I
could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only I
resolv'd to go no more out without a Prospective-
Glass in my Pocket.
When I was come down the Hill, to the End of
the Illand, where indeed I had never been before,
I was presently convinc'd,that the seeing the Print
os a Man's Foot, was not such a strange thing in
the Island as I imagin'd; and but that it was a spe-
cial Providence that I was cast upon the Side of the
Island, where the Savages never came, I should ea-
sily have known, that nothing was more frequent
than for the Canoesirom the Main, when they hap-
pen'd to be a little too far out at Sea, to shoot over
to that Side of the Island for Harbour; likewise as
they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Vic-
tors having taken any Prisoners, would bring them
overto this Shore, where, according to their dread-
ful Customs, being all Cambals, they would kill
and eat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the Hill to the Shore,
as I said above, beingtheS.W.Point of the Island,
I was persectly confounded and amaz'd; nor is
it possible for me to express the Horror of my
Mind, at seeing the Shore spread with Skulls,
Hands, Feet, and other Bones of human Bodies;
and particularly I obfcrv'd a Place where there had
- been
been a Fire made, and a Circle dug in the Earth,
like a Cock-pic, where it is supposed the Savage
Wretches had fat down to their -inhuman Feast-
ings upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures.
I was so astonish'd with the Sight of these
Things, that I entertain'd no Notions of any
Danger to myself from it for a long while; all
my Apprehensions were buried in the Thoughts
of such a Pitch of inhuman, hellish Brutality, and
the Horror of the Degeneracy of human Nature;
which tho' I had heard often, yet I never had so
near a View of before; in short, I turned away
my Face from the horrid Spectacle; my Stomach
grew sick, and I was just at the Point of Faint-
ing, when Nature discharg'd the Disorder from
my Stomach; and having vomited with an uncom-
mon Violence, I was a little relieved ; but could
not bear to stay in the Place a Moment; so I got
me up the Hill again, with all the Speed I could,
and walk'd on towards my own Habitation.
When I came a little out of that Part of the
Island, I stood still awhile as amaz'd; and then
recovering myself, I look'd up with the utmost Af-
section of my Soul, and with a Flood of Tears in
my Eyes, gave God Thanks that had cast my sirst
Lot in a Part of the World, where I was distin-
guished from such dreadful Creatures as these;
and that tho' I had esteem'd my present Condition
very miserable, had yet given me so many Com-
forts in it, that I had still more to give Thanks
for than to complain of; and this above all, that
I had, even in this miserable Condition.been com-
forted with the Knowledge of himself, and the
.Hope of his Blessing, which was a Felicity more
than susficiently equivalent to all the Misery which
I Ud stffer'd, or could susser.
O a

III this Frame of Thankfulness, I went Home to
my Castle, and began to be much easier now, as to
the Sasety of my Circumstances, than ever I was
before; for I observ'd that these Wretches never
came to this Island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not ex-
pecting any Thing here; and having often, no
doubt, been up in the cover'd woody Part os it,
without finding any thing to their Purpose. I knew
I had been here now almost eighteen Years, and
never saw the least Footsteps of human Creature
there before; and I might be here eighteen more
as entirely conceal'd as I was now, if I did not
discover myself to them, which I had no manner
of Occasion to do, it being my only Business to
keep myself entirely conceal'd where I was, un-
less I found a better sort of Creatures than Cani-
bah to make myself known to.
Yet I entertain'd such an Abhorrence of the sa-
vage Wretches that I have been speaking of, and
of the wretched inhuman Custom of their devour-
ing and eating one another up, that I continu'd pen-
sive and sad, and kept close within my own Circle
for almost two Years after this: When I fay my
own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plantations,
.viz,, my Castle, my Country Seat, which I call'd
my Bower, and my Enclosure in the Woods; nor
did I look after this for any other Use than as an
Inclosure for my Goats; for the Aversion which
Nature gave me to these hellish Wretches was
such, that I was searful of seeing them, as of seeing
the Devil himself; nor did I so much as go to look
after my Boat in all this Time; but began rather
to think of making me another; for I could not
think of ever making any more Attempts to bring
the other Boat round the Island to me, lest I
sliould meet with some of these Creatures at Sea,
in
in which, if I had happen'd to have fallen into their
Hands, I knew what would have been my Let.
Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that
I was in no Danger of being discovered by these
People, began to wear off my Uneasiness about
them; and I began to 1 i ve just in the fame compos'd
Manner as before; only with this Difference, that
I us'd more Caution, and kept my Eyes more a-
bout me than I did before, lest I should happen to
be seen by any of them; and particularly I was
more cautious of firing my Gun, lest any of them
being on the Island, should happen to hear of it;
and it was therefore a very good Providence to
me, that I had furnisiYd my self with a tame Breed
of Goats, that I needed not hunt any more about
the Woods, or shoot at 'em; and if I did catch
any of 'em after this, it was by Traps and Snares,
as I had done before; so that for two Years after
this, I believe I never fir'd my Gun once off, tho' I
never went out without it; and which was more,
as I had sav'd three Pistols out of the Ship, I always
carried 'em out with me, or at least two of them,
sticking them in my; Goat-Skin Belt; I also fur-
bisli'd up one of the great Cutlashes, that I had out
of thp Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on also;
so that I was now a most formidable Fellow to look
at, when I went abroad, if you add to the former
Description of my self, the Particular of two Pi-
stols, and a great broad Sword hanging at my Side
in a Belr, but without a Scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some
Time, I seem'd, excepting these Cautions, to be
redue'd to my former calm sedate way of Living,
all these Things tended to shewing me more and
more how far my Condition was from being mise-
rable, compared to some others; nay, to many o-
ther Particulars of Lise, which it might have plea-
O 3 sed
sed God to have made my Lot. It put me upon
reslecting, how little repining there would be
among Mankind, at any Condition of Lise, if Peo-
ple would rather compare their Condition with
those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with those which are
better, to assist their Murmurings and Complain-
ings.
As in my present Condition there were not real-
ly many Things which I wanted; so indeed I
thought that the Frights I had been in about
these Savage Wretches, and the Concern I had been
in for my own Preservation, had taken oft'the Edge
of my Invention for my own Conveniences; and I
had dropt a good Design, which I had once bent
my Thoughts too much upon; and that was to try
if I could not make some of my Barley into Malr,
and then try to brew my self some Beer: This was
really a whimsical Thought, and I reprov'd my
self often for the Simplicity of it; for I presently
saw there would be the Want of several Things ne-
cessary to the making my Beer, that it would be
impossible for me to supply: As First, Casks to
preserve it in, which was a Thing that, as I have
observ'd already, I could never compass; no, tho'
I spent not many Days, but Weeks, nay Months,
in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next
place, I had no Hops to make it keep, no Yeast
to make it work, no Copper or Kettle to make it
boil; and yet all these Things notwithstanding, I
verily believe, had not these Things interven'd, I
mean the Frights and Terrors I was in about the
Savages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought
it to pass too; for I seldom gave any Thing over
without accomplishing it, when I once had it in
iny Head enough to begin it.

But my Invention now run quite aiother Way;
for Night and Day I could think of nothing but
how I might destroy some of these Monsters in their
cruel bloody Entertainment, and, if possible, save
the Victim they should bring hither to destroy. It
would take up a larger Volume than this whole
Work is intended to be, to set down all the Con-
trivances I hatch'd, or rather brooded upon in my
Thoughts, for the destroying these Creatures, or
at least frighting 'em, so as to prevent their cpming
hither any more; but all was abortive, nothing
could be possible to take Effect, unless I was to be
there to do it my self; and what could one Man
do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows,with which they
could shoot as true to a Mark, as I could with my
Gun?
Sometimes I contriv'd to dig a Hole under th?
Place where they made their Fire, and put in five
or six Pounds of Gun-powder, which when they
kindled their Fire, would consequently take Fire,
and blow up all that was near it; but as in the first
place I should be very loth to waste so much Powder
upon em, my Store being now within the Qupn-r
tity of one Barrel; so neither could I be sure of its
going osf, at any certain time, when it might sur-
prize them, and at best, that it would do 1 ittle more
than just blow the Fire about their Ears and frighf
them, but not susficient to make them forsake the
Place; so I laid it aside, and then propos'd, that
I would place my self in Ambush, in some conve-
nient Place, with my three Guns, all double loa-
ded; and in the middle of their bloody Ceremor-
ny let fly at 'em, when I should be sure to kill or
wound perhaps two or three at every shoot; and
then falling in upon them with my three Pistols,
O 4 and
and my Sword, I made do doubt but that if there
were twenty I should kill them all. This Fancy
pleas'd my Thoughts for some Weeks, and I was
so full of it, that I often dreamt of it; and some-
times, that I was just going to let sly at them in
my Sleep.
I went so far with it in my Imagination, that I
employ'd myself several Days to find out propeP
Places to put myself in Ambuscade, as I said, to
watch for them; and I went frequently to the Place
itself, which was now grown more familiar tome;
and especially while my Mind was thus sill'd with
Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody putting
twenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I may
call it; the Horror I had at the Place, and at the
Signals of the barbarous Wretches devouring one
another, abated my Malice.
Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of the
Hill, where I was satisfy'd I might securely wair,
till I saw any of their Boats coming, and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on
Shore,convey my self unseen into Thickets of Trees,
in one of which there was a Hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely; and where I might sit, and
observe all their bloody Doings, and take my full
Aim at their Heads, when they were so close toge-
ther, as that it would be next to impossible that I
should miss my Shoot, or that I could fail wound-
ing three or four of them at the first Shoot.
In this Place then I resolv'd to fix my Design ,
and accordingly I prepar'd two Muskets, and my
ordinary Fowling-Piece. The two Muskets I
loaded with a Brace of Slugs each, and sour or five
smaller Bullets, about the Size of Pistol-Bullets;
and the Fowling-Piece I loaded with near a Hand-
full of Swan-Shot, of the largest Size; I also loaded
my Pistols with about four Bullets each, and in this
* 'Posture,
Posture, well provided with Ammunition for a
second and third Charge, I prepar'd myself for
my Expedition.
After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Design,
and in my Imagination put it in Practice, I conti-
nually made my Tour every Morning up to the
Top of the Hill, which was from my Castle, as
I call'd it, about three Miles, or more, to see if I
could observe any Boats upon the Sea, coming near
the Island, or standing over towards it; but I be-
gan to tire of this hard Duty, after I had for two
or three Months constantly kept my Watch; but
came always back without any Discovery, there
having not in all that Time been the least Appea-
rance, not only on, or near the Shore; but not
on the whole Ocean, so far as my Eyes or Glasses
could reach every Way.
As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill
to look out, so long also I kept up the Vigour of
my Design, and my Spirits seem'd to be all the
while in a suitable Form, for so outrageous an Exe-
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages,
for an Ossence which I had not at all enter'd into
a Discussion of in my Thoughts, any further than
my Passions were at first fir'd by the Horror I con-
ceiv'd at the unnatural Custom of that People of the
Country, who it seems had been sufter'd by Provi-
dence, in his wise Disposition of the World, to have
no other Guide rhan that of their own abominable
and vitiated Passions; and consequently were left,
and perhaps had been so for some Ages, to act such
horrid Things, and receive such dreadful Cu-
stoms, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd
of Heaven, ,and acted by some hellish Degeneracy,
could have run them into: But now when, as I
have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless Ex-
cursion which I ha4 made so long, and so far, eve-
ry Morning in vain, so my Opinion of the Action
itself began to alter, and I began with cooler and.
calmer Thoughts to consider what it was I was go-
ing to engage in; what Authority or Call I had,
to pretend to be Judge and Executioners upon these
Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit
for so many Ages to susser, unpunish'd, to go on,
and to be, as it were, the Executioners of his Judg-
ments one upon another: How far these People
were Offenders against me, and what Right I had
to engage in the Quarrel of thatBlood, which they
lhed promiscuously one upon another, I debated
this very often with my self thus: How do I know
what God himself judges in this particular Case?
It is certain these People do not commit this as a
Crime; it is not against their own Consciences re-
proving, or their Light reproaching them. They
do not know it to be an Ossence, and then commit
it in defiance of divine Justice, as we do in almost
all the Sins we commit. They think it no more a
Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do
to kill an Ox; nor to eat human Flesh, than we
do to eat Mutton.
When I had consider' d this a little, it follow'd
necessarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in
it; that these People were not Murderers in the
.Sense that I had before condemn'd them in my
Thoughts any more than those Christians were
Murderers, who often put to Death the Prisoners
taken in Battle; or more frequently, upon many
Occasions, put whole Troops of Men to the
Sword, without giving Quarter, tho3 they threw
down their Arms and submitted.
In the'next place it occur'd to me, that albeit
the Usage they gave one another was thus brutish
and inhuman; yet it was really nothing to me:
These People had done me no Injury: That if they
attempted.
attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my imme-
diate Preservation to fall upon them, something
might be said for it; but that I was yet out of their
Power, and they had really no Knowledge of me,
and consequently no Design upon me; and there-
fore it could not be just for me to fall upon them.
That this would justify the Conduct of the Spaniards
in all their Barbarities practis'd in America, where
they destroy'd Millions of these People, who, how-
ever they were Idolaters and Barbarians, and had
several bloody and barbarous Rites in rheir Cu-
stoms, such as sacrisicing human Bodies to their I-
dols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent
People; and rhat the rooting 'em out of the Coun-
try, is spoken of with the utmost Abhorrence and
Detestation, by even rhe Spaniards themselves, at
this Time, and by all other Christian Nations of
Europe, as a mere Butchery, a bloody and unnatu-
ral Piece of Cruelty, unjustisiable either to God
or Man; and such, as for which rhe very Name of
a Spaniard is reckon'd to be frightful and terrible to
all People of Humanity, or of Christian Compas-
sion : As if the Kingdom of Spain were particularly
eminent for the Product of a Race of Men, who
were without Principles of Tenderness, or the com-
mon Bowels of Pity to the Miserable, which is rec-
kon'd to be a Mark of generous Temper in the
Mind.
These Considerations really put me to a Pause,
and to a kind of a full Stop; and I began by little
and little to be off of my Design, and to conclude,
I had taken wrong Measures in my Resolutions to
attack the Savages; that it was not my Business to
meddle with 'em, unless they first attack'd me, and
this it was my Business, if possible, to prevent;
but that if I were discover'd, and attack'd, then
I knew my Duty. - . -
On the other hand, I argu'd with my self, That
this realty was the Way nor to deliver my self, but
entirely to mine and destroy myself; for unless I
was sure to kill every one that not only should be
on Shore at that Time, but that should ever come
on Shore afterwards, ifbutoneofthemescap'd, to
tell their Country-People what had happen'd,
they would come over again by Thousands to re-
venge the Death of their Fellows, and I should
only bring upon myself a certain Destruction,
which at present I had no manner of Occasion
for.
Upon the Whole I concluded, that neither in
Principles nor in Policy I ought one Way or other'
to concern myself in this Affair. That my Busi-
ness was by all possible means to conceal myself
from them, and not to leave the least Signal to
them to guessb y, that there were any living Crea-
tures upon the Island; I mean of human Shape.
Religion join'd in with this Prudential, and I
was convine'd now many Ways, that I was per-
sectly out of my Duty, when I was laying all my
bloody Schemes for the Destruction of innocent
Creatures, I mean innocent as to me: As to the
Crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I
had nothing to do with them; they were Natio-
nal, and I ought to leave them to the Justice of
God, who is the Governor of Nations, and knows
how by National Punishments to make a just Re-
tribution for National Offences; and to bring pub-
lick Judgments upon those who offend in a publick
Manner, by such Ways as best please him.
This appear'd so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater Satisfaction to me, than that I had
not been suffer'd to do a Thing which I now saw
so much Reason to believe would have been no less
a Sin, than that of wilful Murder, if I had com-
mitted
micted it; and I gave most humble Thanks on
my Knees to God, that had thus delivet'd me
from Blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to grant
me the Protection of his Providence, that I might
not fall into the Hands of Barbarians; or that I
might not lay my Hands upon them, unlese I had
a more clear Call from Heaven to do it, in De-
sence of my own Lise.
In this Disposition I continu'd for near a Year
after this; and so far was I from desiring an Oc-
casion for falling upon these Wretches, that in all
that Time I never once went up the Hill to see
whether there were any of them in Sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on Shore
there, or nor, that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my Contrivances against them, or be
provoked by any Advantage which might present
itself to fall upon them ; only this I did, I went
and removed my Boat, which I had on the other
Side the Island, and carried it down to the East
End of the whole Island, where I ran it into a little
Cove, which I found under some high Rocks, and
where I knew, by reason of the Currents, the
Savages durst not, at least would not come with
their Boats, upon any Account whatsoever.
With my Boat I carried away every Thing that
I had left there belonging to her, tho' not neces-
sary for the bare going thither, viz,. A Mast and
Sail, which I had made for her, and a Thing like
an Anchor, but indeed which could not be call'd
either Anchor or Grapling; however, it was the
best I could make of its kind: Al l these I remov'd,
that there might not be the least Shadow of any
Discovery, or any Appearance of any Boat, or of
any human Habitation upon the Island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more re-
tired than ever, and seldom went from my Cell,
other
other than upon my constant Employment, viz,. to
milk my She-Goats, and manage my little Flock in
the Wood ; which, as it was quite on the other
Part of the Island, was quite out of Danger; for
certain it is, that these favage People, who some-
times haunted this Island, never came with any
Thoughts of sinding any thing here; and conse-
quently never wandred osf from the Coast; and I
doubt not, but they might have been several times
on Shore, after my Apprehensions of them had
made me cautious,as well as before ; and, indeed,
I look'd back with some Horror upon the Thoughts
of what my Condition would have been, if I had
chop'd upon them, and been difeover'd before that,
when naked and unarm'd, except with one Gun,
and that loaded often only with small Shot. I walk-
ed every where peeping, and peeping about the
Island, to see what I could get; what a Surprize
should I have been in, if, when I discover'd the
Print of a Man's Foot, I had instead of that seen
fifteen or twenty Savages, and found them pur-
suing me, and by the Swiftness of their Running,
no Possibility of my escaping them?
The Thoughts of this sometimes funk my very
Soul within me, and distress'd my Mind so much,
that I could not soon recover it, to think what I
mould have done, and how I not only should not
have been able to resist them, but even should not
have had Presence of Mind enough to do what I
might have done; much less, what now after so
much Consideration and Preparation I might be
able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these
Things, I would be very melancholy, and some-
times it would last a great while; but I resolv'd it
at last all into Thankfulness to that Providence
which had deliver'd me from so many unseen Dan-
gers, and had kept me from those Mischiefs which
I could
I could no way have been the Agent in delivering
myself from; because I had not the least Notion
of any such Thing depending, or the least Sup-
position of it being possible.
This renew'd a Contemplation, which often had
come to my Thoughts in former Time, when first
I began to see the merciful Dispositions of Hea-
ven, in the Dangers we run thro' in this Lise: How
wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know no-
thing of it. How when we are in (a Quandary, as
we call it) a Doubt or Hesitation, whether to go
this Way, or that Way, a secret Hint shall direct
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way;
nay, when Sense, our own Inclination, and perhaps
Business has call'd to go the other Way,yet a strange
Impression upon the Mind,from we know not what
Springs, and by we know not what Power, shall
over-rule us to go this Way; and it shall afterwards
appear,that had we gone thatWay which we should
have gone, and even to our Imagination ought to
have gone, we should have been ruin'd and lost.
Upon these, and many like Reslections, I after-
wards made it a certain Rule with me, That when-
ever I found those secret Hints, or Pressings of my
Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that pre-
sented ; or to going this Way, or that Way, I neves
fail'd to obey the secret Dictate; tho' I knew no
other Reason for it, than that such a Pressure, or
such a Hint hung upon my Mind: I could give ma-
ny Examples of the Success of this Conduct in the
Course of my Lise; but more especially in the lat-
ter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Island; be-
sides many Occasions which it is very likely I might
have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same
Eyes then, that I saw with now: But 'tis never too
late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all consi-
dering Men,whose Lives are attended with such ex-
traordinary
traordinary Incidents as mine, or even tho' not so
extraordinary, not to slight such secret Intimati-
ons of Providence, let them come from what invi-
sible Intelligence they will, that I shall not discuss,
and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they
are a Proof of the Converse of Spirits, and the se-
cret Communication between those embody'd, and
those unembody'd; and such a Proof as can never
be withstood : Of which I shall have Occasion to
give some very rema rkable Instances in the Remain-
der of my solitary Residence in this dismal Place.
I believe the Reader of this will not think
strange, if I consess that these Anxieties, these
constant Dangers I liv'd in, and the Concern that
was now upon me, put an End to all Invention,
and to all the Contrivances that I had laid for my
future Accommodations and Conveniencies. I had
the Care of my Sasety more now upon my Hands,
than that of my Food. I car'd not to drive a Nail,
or chop a Stick of Wood now, for sear the Noise
I should make should be heard ; much less would
I fire a Gun, for the fame Reason; and above all, I
was intolerably uneasy at making any Fire, lest the
Smoak, which is visible at a great Distance in the
Day, should betray me; and for this Reason I
remov'd that Part of my Business which requir'd
Fire, such as burning of Pots and Pipes, &c. into
my new Apartment in the Woods, where, after I
had been some Time, I found, to my unspeakable
Consolation, a mere natural Cave in the Earth,
which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say,
no Savage, had he been at the Mouth of it, would
be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would
any Man else, but one who, like me, wanted no-
thing so much as a sase Retreat.
t
The Mouth of this Hollow was at the Bottom,
of a great Rock, where, by meer Accident (I
would fay, if I did not see abundant Reason to
ascribe all such things now to Providence) I was
cutting down some thick Branches of Trees, to
make Charcoal; and before I go on, I must ob-
serve the Reason os my making this Charcoal;
which was thus:
I was afraid of making a Smoak about my Ha-
bitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my Bread, cooking my
Meat, &c. so I contrived to burn some Wood here,
as I had seen done in England under Turf, till it
became Chark, or dry Coal; and then putting the
Fire out, I preserv'd the Coal to carry home, and
perform the other Services, which Fire was want-
ing for at home, without danger of Smoak.
But this by the by. While I was cutting down
some Wood here, I perceived that behind a very
thick Branch of low Brush-wood, or Under-wood,
there was a kind ofhollow Place; I was curious to.
look into it, and getting with difficulty into the.
Mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that is
to fay, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and
perhaps another with me; but I must consess to
you, I made more haste out than I did in, when
looking further into the Place, and which was per-
sectly dark, I saw two broad shining Eyes of some
Creatute, whether Devil or Man, I knew not,
which twinkled like two Stars, the dim Light
from the Cave's Mouth dining directly in, and
making the Reslection.
However, after some Pause, I recover'd myself,
and began to call myself a thoufand Fools, and
tell myself, that he that was afraid to see the De-
vil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Island all
alone; and that I durst to believe there was no-
Part I. P thing
(•zip ]
thing in this Cave that was more frightful than my
self; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took up
a great Firebrand, and in I rusiYd again, with the ,
Stick slaming in my Hand: I had not gone three
Steps in, but I was almost as much frighted as I was
before; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like that of a
Man in some Pain, and it was follow'd by a broken
Noise, as if of Words half express'd, and then a
deep Sigh again: I step'd back, and was indeed
struck with such a Surprize, that it put me into a
cold Sweat; and if I had had a Hat on my Head,
I will not answer for it, that my Hair might not
have lifted it osf. But still plucking up my Spirits
as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little,
with considering that the Power and Presence of
God was every where, and was able to protect me;
upon this I step'd forward again, and by the Light
of the Firebrand, holding it up a little over my
Head, I saw lying on the Ground a most monstrous
frightful old He-Goat, just making his Will, as we
fay, and gasping for Lise, and dying indeed of
meer old Age.
I stir'd him a little, to see if I could get him out,
and he essay'd to get up, but was not able to raise
himself; and I thought with my self, he might e'en
lie there; for if he had frighted me so, he would
certainly fright any of the Savages, if any of them
should be so hardy as to come in there while he
had any Lise in him.
I was now recover'd from my Surprize, and be-
gan to look round me, when I found the Cave was
but very small, that is to fay, it might be about
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, ei-
ther round or squars, no Hands having ever been
employed in making it, but thole of meer Nature:
I observ'd also, that there was a Place at the fur-
ther side of it that went in further, but was so
IbW, that it required me to creep upon my Hand*
and Knees to go into it,and whither I went I knew
not i so having no Candle, I gave it over for some
time; but resolved to come again the next Day,
provided with Candles, and a Tinder-box, which
I had made of the Lock of one of the Muskets,
with some Wild-fire in the Pan.
Accordingly, the next Day I came provided
with six large Candles of my own making; for I
made very good Candles now of Goat's Tallow;
and going into this low Place, I was obliged to
creep upon all Fours, as I have said, almost ten
Yards; which, by the way, I thought was a Ven-
ture bold enough, considering that 1 knew not how
far it might go, nor what was beyond if. When
I was got thro' the Strait, I found the Roof rose
higher up, I believe near twenty Foot; but never
was such a glorious Sight seen in the Island, I dare
fay, as it was, to look round the Sides and Roof
of this Vault or Cave; the Walls reslected a hun-
dred thousand Lights to me from my two Candles;
what it was in the Rock, whether Diamonds, or
any other precious Stones, or Gold, which I rather
supposed it to be, I knew not.
The Place I was in, was a most delightful Ca-
vity, or Grotto, of its kind, as could be expected,
tho' persectly dark; the Floor was dry and le-
vel, and had a sort of small loose Gravel upon
it; so that there was no nauseous or venomous
Creature to be seen, neither was there any Damp
orWet on the Sides or Roof: The only Difficul-
ty in it was the Entrance, which, however, as it
was a Place of Security, and such a Retreat as I
wanted, I thought that was a Convenience; so
that I was really rejoiced at the Discovery, and re-
sdved, without any delay, to bring some of those
things which I was most anxious about to this
% Pa Place;
Place; particularly, I resolv'd to bring hither my
Magazine of Powder, and all mys spare Arms,
lite.. Two Fowling-Pieces, (for I had three in all)
and three Muskets, (for of them I had eight in all;)
so I kept at my Castle only five, which stood rea-
dy mounted, like Pieces of Cannon, on my out-
most Fence; and were ready also to take out upon
any Expedition.
Upon this Occasion of removing my Ammuni-
tion, I took occasion to open the Barrel of Pow-
der which I took up out of the Sea, and which
had been wet; and I found that the Water had pe-
netrated about three or four Inches into the Pow-
der on every side, which caking and growing hard,
had preserved the inside like a Kernel in a Shell;
so that I had near sixty pounds of ver-y good Pow-
der in the Centre of the Cask; and this was an a-
greeable Discovery to me at that time; so I car-
ried all away thither, never keeping above two or
three pounds of Powder with me in my Castle, for
sear of a Surprize of any kind: I also carried thi-
ther all the Lead I had left for Bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient Gi-
ants, which were said to live in Caves and Holes
in the Rocks, where none could come at them;
for I perswaded my self, while I was here, if five
hundred Savages were to hunt me, they could ne-
ver find me out; or if they did, they would not
venture to attack me here.
The old Goat, who I found expiring, died in
the Mouth of the Cave, the next Day after I made
this Discovery; and I sound it much easier to dig
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover
him with Earth, than to drag him out: So I in-
terr'd him there, to prevent Offence to my Nose.
I was
V.
I was now^in my twenty-third Year of Resi-
dence in this Island, and was so naturalized to the
Place, and to the Manner of living, that could I
have but enjoyed the Certainty, that no Savages
would come to the Place to disturb me, I could
have been content to have capitulated forspending
1 the rest of my Time there, even to the last Mo-
ment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old
Goat in the Cave. I had also arriv'd to some little
Diversions and Amusements,which made the Time
pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than
it did before; at first, I had taught my Poll, as I
noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly,
and talk'd so articulately and plain, that it was
very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less
than lix and twenty Years. How long he might
live afterwards, I know not; tho' I know they
have a Notion in the Brajils, that they live a hun-
dred Years; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there
still, calling after Poor Robin Crusoe to this Day. I
wish no Englijhman the ill Luck to come there and .>.
hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe
it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleasant
and loving Companion to me for no less than six-
teen Years of my Time, and then died of meer
old Age; as for my Cats, they multiplied, as I have
observ'd, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot
several of them at first, to keep them from devour-
ing me and all I had; but at length, when the
two old ones I brought with me were gone, and
after some time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no Provision with me, they
all ran wild into the Woods, except two or three
Favourites, which 1 kept tame, and whose Young,
when they had any, I always drown'd; and these
were part of my Family. Besides these, I always
kept two or three Houstiold Kids about me,\vhieh I
P 3 taugne
taught to seed out of my Hand; arid I had two
more Parrots, which talk d pretty well, and would
all call Robin Crusoe, but none like my first; nor in-
deed, did I take the Pains with any of them that I
had done with him. I had also several tame Sea-
Fowls, whose Names I know not, which I caught
upon the Shore, and cut their Wings; and the lit-
tle Stakes which I had planted before my Castler
Wall, being now grown up to a good thick Grove,
these Fowls all lived among these low Trees, and
bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so
that, as I said above, I began to be very well con-
tented with the Lise J led, if it might but have
been secured from the Dread of the Savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not
be amiss for all People who shall meet with my
Story, to make this just Observation from it, viz,.
How frequently, in the Course pf our Lives, the
Evil which in it self we, seek most to Ihun, and
.which, when we are fallen into, is the most dread-
ful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of
pur Deliverance, by which alone we can be rais'd
again from the Affliction we are fallen into. I could
give many Examples of this in the Course of my un-
accountable Lise; but in nothing was it more par-
ticularly remarkable than in the Circumstances of
my last Years of solitary Residence in this Wand.
It was now the Month of December, as I said a-
bpie, in my twenty-third Year; and this being the
southern Solstice, for Winter I cannot call it, was
the particular Time of my Harvest, and required
my being pretty much abroad in the Fields; when
going out pretty early in the Morning, even before
it was thorow Day-light, I was surpriz'd with see-
ing a Light of some Fire upon the Shore, at a di-
stance from me, of about two Miles, towards the
end of the Island, where I had observed some Sa-
vages had been, as before, but not on the ot.hcr
Side; but to my great Affliction, it was on my
Side of the Island.
I was indeed terribly surpriz'd at the Sight, and
slept short within my Grove, not daring to go
out lest I might be surpriz'd; . and yet I had no
more Peace within, from the Apprehensions I had,
that if these Savages, in rambling over the Island,
should find my Corn standing, or cut, or any of my
Works and Improvements, they would immediate-
ly conclude, that there were People in the Place,
and would then never give over till they had found
me out: In this Extremity I went back directly to
my Castle, pull'd up the Ladder after me, and made
all things without look as wild and natural as I
could. -
Then I prepared my self within, putting my self
in a Posture of Desence; I loaded all my Cannon, as
I call'd them; that is to fay, my Muskets, which
were mounted upon my new Fortisication, and all
my Pistols, and resolv'd to desend my self to the
last Gasp, not forgetting seriously to commend my
self to the divine Protection, and earnestly to pray
to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the Bar-
barians; and in this Posture I continu'd about two
Hours, but began to be mighty impatient for In-
telligence abroad, for I had no Spies to send out.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this Case, I was not able to bear sit-
ting in Ignorance any longer; so setting up my
Ladder to the side of the Hill, where there was 4
flat Place, as I observed before, and then pulling
the Ladder up after me, I set it up again, and
mounted to the Top of the Hill; and pulling out
my Prospective-Glass, which I had taken on pur-
pose, I laid me down slat on my Belly on the
Ground, and began to look for the Place. I pre^
p 4 &ntlY
sently found there were no less than nine naked Sa-
vages sitting round a small Fire, they had made,
not to warm them, for they had no need of that,
the Weather being extream hot; but, as I sup-
pos'd, to dress some of their barbarous Diet of hu-
mane Flesh, which they had brought with them,
whether alive or dead, I could not know.
They had two Canoes with them, which they had
haled up upon the Shore; and as it was then Tide
of Ebb, they scem'd to me to wait for the Return
of the Flood, to go away again; it is not easy to
imagine what Confusion this Sight put me into,
especially seeing them come on my side the Island,
and so near me too; but when I observ'd their
coming must be always with the Current of the
Ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my
Mind, being satisfy'd that I might go abroad with
Sasety all the Time of the Tide of Flood, if they
were not on Shore before: And having made this
Observation, I went abroad about my Harvest-
Work with the more Composure.
As I expected, so it prov'd; for as soon as the
Tide made to the Westward, I saw them all take
Boat, and row ( or paddle, as we call it) all a-
way: I should have observ'd, that for an Hour
and more before they went off, they went to dan-
cing, and I could easily discern their Postures and
Gestures by my Glasses: I could not perceive, by
my nicest Observation, but that they were stark
naked, and had not the least Covering upon them;
but whether they were Men or Women, that I
could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them ship'd and gone, I took
two Guns upon my Shoulders, and two Pistols at
my Girdle, and my great Sword by my side, with-
out a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able
to make, I went away to the Hill, where I had dis-
cover'
d
cover'd the first Appearance of all; and as soon as
I got thither, which was not less than two Hours,
(for I could not go apace, being so loaden with
Arms as I was) I percCiv'd there had been three
Canoes more of Savages on that Place; and look-
ing out further, I saw they were all at Sea toge-
ther, making over for the Main.
This was a dreadful Sight to me, especially
when going down to the Shore, I could see the
Marks of Horror which the dismal Work they had
been about had left behind it, viz,. the Blood, the
Bones, and Part of the Flesh of human Bodies,
eaten and devour'd by those Wretches, with Mer-
riment and Sport; I was so sill'd with Indigna-
tion at the Sight, rhat I began now to premedi-
tate the Destruction of the next that I saw there,
let them be who or how many soever.
It seem'd evident to me, that the Visits which
they thus make to this Island, are not very fre-
quent ; for it was above fifteen Months before
any more of them came on Shore there again; that
is to fay, I never saw them, or any Footsteps, or
Signals of them, in all that time; for as to the
rainy Seasons, then they are sure not to come a-
broad, at least not so far; yet all this while I
liv'd uncomfortably, by reason of the constant
Apprehensions I was in of their coming upon me
by surprize; from whence I observe, that the Ex-
pectation of Evil is more bitter than the Suffer-
ing; especially if there is no room ro shake osf
that Expectation, or those Apprehensions.
During all ^his time, I was in the murdering
Humour; v„: v>ok upmost of my Hours, which
should have ! e m better employ'd, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them the very
next time I should see them; especially if they
ftould be divided, as they were the last time, in-
to
to two Parties ; nor did I consider at all, that if I
kilPd one Party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was still
the next Day, or Week, or Month, to kill another,
and so, another, even adinfinitum, till I should be ac
length no less a Murderer than they were in being
Man-eaters, and perhaps much more so.
I spent my Days now in great Perplexity and
Anxiety of Mind, expecting that I should one Day
or other fall into the Hands ofthese merciless Crea-
tures; and if I did at any time venture abroad, it
.was not without looking round me with the great-
est Care and Caution imaginable; and now I found
to my great Comfort, how happy it was that I
provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats; for
I durst not upon any account sire my Gun, espe-
cially near that side of the Island where they usu-
ally came, lest I should alarm the Savages; and
if they had sled from me now, I was sure to have
them come back again, with perhaps two or three
hundred Canoes with them in a sew Days, and then
I knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a Year and three Months
more, before I ever saw any more of the Savages,
and then I found them again, as I shall soon observe.
It is true, they might have been there once or twice;
but either they made no Stay, or at least, I did not
hear them; but in the Month of Mayf as near as I
could calculate, and in my four and twentieth Year,
I had a very strange Encounter with them,of which
in its Place.
The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fif-
teen or sixteen Months Interval, was very great;
I slept unquiet, dreamt always frightful Dreams,
and often started out of my Sleep in the Night: In
the Day great Troubles overwhelmed my Mind,
and in the Night I dreamt often of killing the
Savages,
[«9l
Savages, and of the Reasons why I might justify
the doing of it: But to wave all this for awhile;
it was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth Day
I think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar
would reckon; for I mark'd all upon the Post still;
I fay, it was on the sixteenth of May, that it blew
a very great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great
deal of Lightning and Thunder, and a very foul
Night it was after it: I know not what was the
particular occasion of it; but as I was reading in
the Bible, and taken up with very serious Thoughts
about my present Condition, I was surpriz'd with
a Noise of a Gun, as I thought, fir'd at Sea.
This was to be sure a Surprize of a quite disfe-
rent Nature from any I had met with before; for
the Notions this put into my Thoughts were quite
of another kind. I started up in the greatest Haste
imaginable, and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the
middle Place of the Rock, and pull'd it after me,
and mounting it the second Time, got to the Top
of the Hill, the very Moment that a Flash of Fire
bid me listen for a second Gun, which accordingly,
in about half a Minute, I heard, and by the Sound
knew that it was from that Part of the Sea where
I was driven down the Current in my Boat.
I immediately consider'd that this must be some
Ship in Distress, and that they had some Comrade,
or some other Ship in company.and fir'd these Guns
for Signals of Diitress, and to obtain Help: 1 had
this Presence of Mind at that minute, as to think,
that tho' I could not help them, it may be they
might help me; sol brought together all the
dry Wood I could get at hand, and making a good
handsome Pile, I set it on Fire upon the Hill; the
Wood was dry, and blaz'd freely; and tho' the
Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, that.
I y/as certain, if there was any such Thing as a
Ship,
Ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they did,
for as soon as ever my Fire blaz'd up, I heard ano-
ther Gun, and after that several others, all from the
fame Quarter. I ply'd my Fire all Night long, till
Day broke; and when it was broad Day, and the
Air clear'd up, I saw something at a great Distance
at Sea, fsll East of the Island, whether a Sail, ora
Hull, I could not distinguish, no not with my Glas-
ses, the Distance was so great, and the Weather still
something hazy also; at least it was so out at Sea.
I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and soon
perceiv'd that it did not move; so I presently con-
cluded that it was a Ship at an Anchor; and being
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfy'd, I took my
Gun in my Hand, and run toward the South-East
Side of the Island, to the Rocks where I had for-
merly been carry'd away with the Current, and
getting up there, the Weather by this Time being
persectly clear, I couid plainly see, to my great
Sorrow, the Wreck of a Ship cast away in the
Night, upon those concealed Rocks which I found
when I was out in my Boat; and which Rocks, as
they check'd the Violence of the Stream.and made
a kind of Counter-Stream or Eddy, were the Oc-
casion of my recovering from the most desperate
hopeless Condition that ever I had been in in all
my Lise.
Thus,what is one Man's Sasety,is another Man's
Destruction; for it seems these Men, whoever they
were, being out of their Knowledge, and the
Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven
upon them in the Night,the Wjnd blowing hard at
E. and E. N. E. Had they seen the Island, as I must
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endeavour'd to have sav'd.themselves
on Shore by the Help of their Boat; but their firing
of Guns for Help, especially when they saw, as I
imagin'd,
imagin'd, my Fire, fill'd me with many Thoughts:
First I imagin'd, that upon seeing my Light, they
might have put themselves into their Boat, and
have endeavour'd to make the Shore; but that the
Sea going very high, they might have been cast
away; other times I imagin'd, that they might
have lost their Boat before, as might be the Case
many ways; as particularly, by the Breaking of
the Sea upon their Ship, which many times obli-
ges Men to stave, or take in pieces their Boat; and
sometimes to throw it over Board with their own
Hands: Other times I imagin'd, they had some
other Ship or Ships in Company, who, upon the
Signals of Distress they had made, had taken theni
up and carry'd them off: Other whiles I fancy'd,
they were all gone off to Sea in their Boat, and
being hnrry'd away by the Current that I had been
formerly in, were carry'd out into the great Ocean
where thete was nothing but Misery and Perishing;
and that perhaps they might by this Time think of
starving, and of being in a Condition to eat one
another.
As all these were but Conjectures at best,so in the
Condition I was in, I could do no more than look
on upon the Misery of the poor Men, and pity
them, which had still this good Effect on my Side,
that it gave me more and more Cause to give
Thanks to God, who had so happily and comfort-
ably provided for me in my desolate Condition; and
that of two Ships Companies who were now cast
away upon this Part of the World, not one Lise
should be spar'd but mine: I learnt here again to
observe, that it is very rare that the Providence of
God casts us into any Condition of Lise so low, or
any Misery so great, but we may see something or
other to be thankful for; and may see others in
worse Circumstances than our own.
Such
Such certainly was the Case of these Men, of*
whom I could not so much as see Room to sup-
pose any of them were fav'd; nothing could make
it rational, so much as to wish or expect that they
did not all perish there, except the Possibility only
of their being taken up by another Ship in Com-
pany: and this was but mere Possibility indeed; for
I saw not the least Signal or Appearance of any
such Thing.
I cannot explain,by any possible Energy of Words,
what a strange Longing or Hankering of Desires I
selt in my Soul upon this Sight; breaking out some-
times thus; O that there had been but one or two;
nay, or but one Soul fav'd out of the Ship, to have
efcap'd to me, that I might but have hadone Com-
panion, one Fellow-Creature to have spoken tome,
and to have convers'd with! In all the Time of my
solitary Lise, 1 never selt so earnest, so strong a De-
sire after the Society of my Fellow-Creatures, or so
deep a Regret at the Want of it.
There are some secret moving Springs in the Af-
fections, which, when they are set a-going by some
Object in View, or be it some Object, though not
in View, yet render'd present to the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the
Soul by its Impetuosity to such violent, eager Em-
bracings of the Object, that the Absence of it is
insupportable.
Such were these earnest Wishings, That but one
Man had been fav'd! O that it had been but One! I
believe I repeated the Words, 0 that it hadbeen but
Onel a thousand times; and the Desires were so
mov'd by it, that when I spoke the Words, my
Hands would clinch together, and my Fingers press
the Palms of my Hands, that if I had had any soft
Thing in my Hand, it would have crush'd it invo-
luntarily ; and my Teeth in my Head would strike
together,
together, and set against one another so strong,
that for some time I could not part them again.
Let the Naturalists explain these Things, and
the Reason and Manner of them; all I can say to
them is, to describe the Fact, which was even sur-
prising tome when I sound it; tho'lknew not from
what it should proceed, it was doubtless the Effect
of ardent Wishes, and of strong Ideas form'd in my
Mind, realizing the Comfort which the Conversa-
tion of one of my Fellow-Christians would have
been to me.
But it was not to be; either their Fate, or mine,
or both, forbid it; for till the last Year of my be-
ing on this Island, I never knew whether any were
sav'd out of that Ship or no; and had only the Af-
sliction some Days after, to see the Corps of a
drown'd Boy come on Shore, at the End of the
Island, which was next the Shipwreck: He had on
no Cloaths, but a Seaman's Wastcoat, a Pair of o-
pen knee'd Linnen Drawers, and a blue Linnen
Shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guese
what Nation he was of: He had nothing in his
Pocket but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobacco-
Pipe; the last was to me of ten times more Value
than the sirst.
I was now calm, and I had a great Mind to
venture out in my Boat to this Wreck; not doubt-
ing but I might find something on Board, that
might be useful to me; but that did not altogether
press me so much, as the Possibility that there
might be yet some living Creature on board,whose
. Lise I might not only save, but might, by saving
that Lise, comfort my own to the last Degree;
and this Thought clung so to my Heart, that I
could not be quiet, Night nor Day, but I must
venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck; and
committing the rest to Cod's Piovidence, I thought
the Impression was so strong upon my Mind, that
it could not be resisted, that it must come, from
some invisible Direction, and that I should be want-
ing to my self, if I did not go.
Under the Power of this Impression, I hasten'd
back to my Castle, prepar'd every Thing for my
Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot
for fresh Water, a Compass to steer by, a Bottle of
Rum; for I had still a great deal of that left; a
Basket full of Raisins: And thus loading my self
with every Thing necessary, I went down to my
Boat, got the Water out of her, and got her asloat,
loaded all my Cargo in her, and then went Home
again for more; my second Cargo was a great Bag
full of Rice, the Umbrella to set up over my Head
for Shade, another large Pot full of fresh Water,
and about two Dozen of my small Loaves, or
Barley Cakes, more than before, with a Bottle of
Goat's Milk, and a Cheese; all which, with great
Labour and Sweat, I brought to my Boat; and
praying to God to direct my Voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the Canoe along the Shore,
I came at last to the utmost Point of the Island,
on that Side, (viz,.) N. E. And now I was to launch
out into the Ocean, and either to venture, or not
to venture. I look'd on the rapid Currents which
tan constantly on both Sides of the Island, at a
Distance, and which were very terrible to me,
from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been
in before, and my Heart began to fail me; for I
foresaw that if I was driven into either of those
Currents, I should be carry'd a vast Way out to
Sea, and perhaps out of my Reach, or Sight of
the Island again ,• and that then, as my Boat was
but small, if any little 6ale of Wind fliould rise, I
should be inevitably lost.
These Thoughts so oppress'd my Mind, that I
began to give over my Enterprise, and having ha-
led my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, I
slept out, and fate me down upon a little rising
bit of Ground, very pensive and anxious, between
Fear and Desire about my Voyage; when, as 1 was
musing, I could perceive that the Tide was turn'd
and the Flood came on, upon which my going was
for so many Hours impracticable. Upon this
presently it occur'd to me, that I iliould go up to
the highest Piece of Ground I could find, and ob-
serve, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide or Cur-
rents lay, when the Flood came in, that I might
judge whether, if I was driven one Way out, I
might not expect to be driven another Way home,
with the fame Rapidness of the Currents: This
Thought was no sooner in my Head, but I cast my
Eye upon a little Hill, which sufficiently over-
look' d the Sea both Ways, and from whence I had
a clear View of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide*
and which Way I was to guide myself in my Re-
turn ; here I found, that as the Current of the Ebb
set out close by the South Point of the Illand, so
the Current of the Flood set in close by the Shore
ot the North Side, and that I had nothing to do-
but to keep to the North of the Island in my Re-
turn, and I should do well enough.
Encourag'd with this Observation, I resolv'd the
next Morning to set out with the first of the Tide;
and reposing myself for the Night in the Canoe,
under the gteat Watch-coat I mention'd, Ilaunch'd
out: I made first a little out to Sea full North, till
I began to seel the Benefit of the Current, which set
Eastward, and which carry'd me at a great Rate,
and yet did not so hurry me as the Southern Side
Current had done before, and for as to take from
me all Government of the Boat; but having a
Part I. Q. strong
strong Steerage with my Paddle, I went at a
great Rate, directly for the Wreck, and in less
than two Hours I came up to it.
It was a dism.il Sight to lopk at: The Ship,
which by its Buiiding was 'Sfariijh, stuck fast,
jaum'd in between two Rocks; all the Stern and
Quarter of her was beaten to Pieces with the Sea;
and as her Forecastle, which stuck in the Rocks,
had run on with great Violence, her Mainmast and
Foremast were broi ght by the Board ; that is to
fay, broken short oft; but her Boltfprit was found,
and the Head and Bow appear'd firm; when I
came close to her, a Dog appear'd upon her, who
seeing me coming, yelp'd and cry'd, and as soon
as I call'd him, jump'd into the Sea, to come to
me, and I took him into the Boat, but found him
almost dead for Hunger and Thirst : I gave him
a Cake of my Bread, and he eat it like a rave-
nous Wolf, that had been starving a Fortnight in
the Snow: I then gave the poor Creature some
fresh Water, with which, if I would have let him,
he would have burst himself.
After this I went on Board ; but the first Sight
I met with, was two Men drown'd in the Cook-
Room, or Forecastle of the Ship, with their Arms
fast about one another: I concluded, as is indeed
probable, that when the Ship struck, it being in a
Storm, the Sea broke so high, and so continually
over her, that the Men were not able to bear it,
and were strangled with the cor.stant rushing in of
the Water, as much as if they had been under
Water. Besides the Dog, there was nothing left in
the Ship that had Lise, nor any Goods that I
could see, but what were fpoil'd by the Water.
There were some Casks of Liquor, whether Wine
or Brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the
Hold ; and which, the Water being ebb'd our, I
could
could see ; but they were too big to meddle with:
I saw several Chests, which I believ'd belong'd to
some of the Seamen, and I got two of them in-
to the Boat, withour examining what was in them.
Had the Stern of the Ship been fix'd, and the
Fore-part broken off, I am persuaded I might
have made a good Voyage; for by what I sound
in these two Chests, I had room to suppose the
Ship had a great deal of Wealth on board ; and
if I may guess by the Course she steer'd, (he must
have been bound from the Buenos A,res, or the
Rio de la Plata, in the South Patt of America, be-
yond the Brajils, to the Havana, in the Gulph of
Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain: She had, no
doubt, a great Treasure in her, but of no Use
at that time to any Body; and what became of
the rest of her People, I then knew not.
I found, besides these Chests, a little Cask full of
Liquor, of about twenty Gallons, which I got in-
to my Boat, with much Difficulty : There were
several Muskets in a Cabbin, and a great Powder-
horn, with about four Pounds of Powder in it;
as for the Muskets, I had no occasion for them, so
I left them, but took the Powder-horn : I took a
Fire-shovel and Tongs, which I wanted extreme-
ly ; as also two little Brass Kettles, a Copper-Pot
to make Chocolate, and a Gridiron; and with
this Cargo, and the Dog, I came away, the Tide
beginning to make home again ; and the fame E-
vening.about an Hour within Night, I reach'd the
Ifland again, weary and fatigu'd to the last Degree.
I repos'd that Night in the Boat, and in the Morn-
ing I resolv'd to harbour what I had gotten in my
newCa.ve,not to carry it home to my Castle. After
refreshing myself, I got all my Cargo on Shore, and
began to examine the Particulars: The Cask of
Liquor I found to be a kind of Rum, but not such
Q 2 as
as we had at the Brafils ; and in a Word, not at
all good; but when I came to open the Chests, I
found several things of great Use to me: For Ex-
ample, I found in one a fine Case of Bottles, of an
extraordinary kind, andsill'd with Cordial Waters,
fine, and very good; the Bottles held about three
Pints each, and were tip't with Silver: I found
two Pots of very good Succades,or Sweetmeats,
so fasten'd also on Top, that the salt Water had
not hurt them ; and two more of the same, which
the Water had spoil'd: I found some very good
Shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and a half of Linnen white Handkerchiess,
and colour'd Neckcloths; the former were also
very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe
my Face in a hot Day; besides this, when I came
to the Till in the Chests, I found there three great
Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held about eleven
hundred Pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapt
up in a Paper, six Doubloons of Gold, and some
small Bars or Wedges of Gold ; I suppose they
might all weigh near a Pound.
The other Chest I found had some Cloaths in it,
but of little Value ; but by the Circumstances it
must have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate, tho'
there was no Powder in ir, but about two Pounds
of fine glaz'd Powder, in three small Flasks, kept,
I suppose, for charging their Fowling-pieces on oc-
casion : Upon the whole, I got very little by this
Voyage, that was of any ule to me ; for as to the
Money, I had no manner of occasion for it; 'twas
to me as the Dirt under my Feet; and I would
have given it all for three or four Fair of Englijh
Shoes and Stockings, which were things I greatly
wanted, but had not had on my Feet now for
many Years: I had, indeed, gotten two Pair of
Shoes now, which I took oft of the Feet of the
two
two drown'd Men, who I saw in the Wreck; and
I found two Pair more in one of the Chests, which
were very welcome to me ; but they were not like
our Englijh Shoes, either for Ease or Service, be-
ing rather what we call Pumps than Shoes : I
found in this Seaman's Chest about fifty Pieces of
Eight in Royals, but no Gold; I suppose this
belong'd to a poorer Man than the other, which
seem'd to belong to some Officer.
Well, however, I lugged this Money home to
my Cave, and laid it up, as I had done that be-
fore, which I brought from our own Ship; but it
was great Pity, as I said, that the other Part of
this Ship had not come to my Share, for I am sa-
tisfy'd I might have loaded my Canoe several times
over with Money, which, if I had ever escap'd to
England, would have lain here sase enough till I
might have come again and setch'd it.
Having now brought all my Things on Shore,
and secur'd them, I went back to my Boat, and
row'd or paddled her along the Shore to her old
Harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best
of my Way to my old Habitation, where I found
every Thing sase and quiet; so I began to repose
myself, live aster my old Fashion, and take care of
my Family Affairs; and for a while I liv'd easy
enough; only that I was more vigilant than I us'd
to be, look'd out oftner, and did not go abroad so
much ; and if at any time I did stir with any Free-
dom, it was always to the East Part of the Island,
where I was pretty well satisfy'd the Savages ne-
ver came, and where I could go without so many
Precautions, and such a Load of Arms and Am-
munition, as I always carry'd with me, if I went
the othet Way.
I liv'd in this Condition near two Years more;
but my unlucky Head, that was always to let me
3 know
know it was bom to make my Body miserable,
'was all the two Years fill'd with Projects and De-
signs how, if it were possible, I might get away
from this Island; for sometimes I was for making
another Voyage to the Wreck, tho' my Reason
told me that there was nothing left there worth the
Hazard of my Voyage: Sometimes for a Ramble
one Way, sometimes another; and I believe veri-
ly, if I had had the Boat that I went from Sallee
in, I mould have ventur'd to Sea, bound any where,
I knew not whither.
I have been, in all my Circumstances, a Memento
to those who are touch'd with the general Plague
of Mankind, whence, for ought 1 know, one half
of their Miseries slow; I mean, that of not being
.satisfy'd with the Station wherein God and Na-
ture hath plac'd them; for not to look back upon
my primitive Condition, and the excellent Advice
of my Father, the Opposition to. which was, as I
may call it, my Original Sin, my subsequent
Mistakes of the fame kind had been the means of
my coming into this miserable Condition; for had
that Providence, which so happily had seated me
at the Brafih, as a Planter, bless'd me with con-
fin'd Desires, and I could have been contented to
have gone on gradually, I might have been by this
Time, I mean m the T"ime of my being in this Island,
one of the most considerable Planters in the Bra-
fih; nay, I am persuaded, that by the Improve-
ments I had made in that little time I liv'd there,
and the Encrease I mould probably have made, if I
had stay'd, I might have been worth an hundred
thousand Moyadores; and what Business had I to
leave a settled Fortune, a well-slock'd Plantation,
improving and increasing, to turn Supra Cargo to
Guinea, to setch Negroes, when Patience and
Time would have so encreas'd our Stock at
Home,
Home, that we could have bought them at ou r
own Door, frcm those whose Business it was to
setch them? And though it had cost us something
more, yet the Difference of that Price was by nb
means worth saving at so great a Hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young. Heads,
so Reslection upon the Folly of it is as ordinarily
the Exercise os more Years, or of the dear-bought
Experience of Time; and so it was with me now;
and yet so deep had the Mistake taken Root in my
Temper, that I could not satisfy my self in my
Station, but was continually poring upon the
. Means and Possibility of my Escape from this
Place; and that I may with the greater Pleasure
to the Reader bring on the remaining Part of my
Story, it may not be improper to give some Ac-
count of my sirst Conceptions on the Subject of
this foolish Scheme for my Escape; and how, and
upon what Foundation I acted.
I am now to be suppos'd retir'd into my Ca-
stle, after my late Voyage to the Wreck, my Fri-
gate laid up, and secur'd under Water as usual,
and my Condition restor'd to what it was before:
I had more Wealth, indeed, than I had before,
but was not at all the richer; for I had no more
Use for it, than the Indians of Peru had before the
Spaniards came there.
It was one of the Nights, in the rainy Season in
March, the four and twentieth Year of my sirst set-
ting Foot in this Island of Solitariness, I was ly-
ing in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in
Health, had no Pain, no Distemper, no Uneasi-
ness of Body, no, nor any Uneasiness of Mind,
more than ordinary; but could by no means close
my Eyes; that is, so as to sleep; no, not a Wink
all Nightlong, otherwise than as follows:
Q4 11
It is as impossible as needless, to set down the
innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd
through that great Thorowfair of the Brain, the
Memory, in this Night's Time: I run over the
whole History of my Lise in Miniature, or by
Abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this
Island; and also of the Part of my Lise since I
came to this Island. In my Reslections upon the
Stare of my Case, since I came on Shore on this
Island, I was comparing the happy Posture of my
Asfairs, in the sirst Years of my Habitation here,
compar'd to the Lise of Anxiety, Fear, and Care,
which I had liv'd in ever since I had seen the Print of
a Foot in the Sand; not that I did not believe the
Savages had frequented the Island even all the while,
and might have been several Hundreds of them at
Times on Shore there; bur I had never known it,
and was incapable of any Apprehensions about it;
my Satisfaction was persect, tho' my Danger was
the fame ; and I was as happy in not knowing my
Danger, as if 1 had never really been expos'd to it.
This furnish'd my Thoughts with many vety pro-
fitable Reslections, and particularly this one, How
infinitely good that Providence is, which has pro-
vided in its Government of Mankind such narrow
Bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things;
and tho' he walks in the midst of so many thousand
Dangers, the Sight of which, if discqver'd to him,
would distract his Mind, and sink his Spirits, he is
kept serene and calm, by having the Events of
Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing nothing
of the Dangers which surround him.
After these Thoughts had for some Time enter-
tain'd me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real
Danger I had been in for so many Years in this
very Island; and how I had walk'd about in the
greatest Security, and with all possible Tranquilli-
ty i
ty; even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a
Hill, a great Tree, or the casual Approach of
Night, had been between me and the worst kind
of Destruction, viz,. Thatrof falling into the Hands
of Canibals and Savages, who would have sciz'd
on me with the fame View as I did of a Goat ot
a Turtle, and have thought it no more a Crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon or a
Curlieu. I should unjustly ilander 'my self, if I
should fay I was not sincerely thankful to my great
Preserver, to whose singular Protection I acknow-
ledge, with great Humility, that all these un-
known Deliverances were due; and without which
I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless
Hands.
When these Thoughts were over, my Head was
for some time taken up in considering the Nature
of these wretched Creatures, I mean, the Savages;
and how it came to pass in the World, that the
wise Governour of all Things should give up any
of his Creatures to such Inhumanity; nay, to some-
thing so much below even Brutality itself, as to
devour its own Kind: But as this ended in some
( at that Time fruitless ) Speculations, it occur'd
to me to enquire, what Part of the World these
Wretches liv'd in; how far osf the Coast was from
whence they came; what they ventur'd over so far
from Home for; what kind of Boats they had;,
and why I might not order my self, and my Busi-
ness so, that I might be as able to go over thh
ther, as they were to come to me.
I never so much as troubled my self to consider
what I should do with my self when I came thi-r
ther; what would become of me, if I sell into the
Hands of the Savages; or how I should eseape from
them, if they attempted me; no, nor so much as
Jipw it was possible for me to reach the Coast, and
not be attempted by some or other of them, with-
out any Possibility of delivering myself; and if I
should not fall into their Hands, what I mould do
for Provision, or whither I mould bend my Course;
none of these Thoughts, I fay, so much as came
in my way; but my Mind was wholly bent upon
the Notion of my passing over in my Boat to the
main Land: I look'd back upon my present Condi-
tion, as the most miserable that could possibly be;
that I was not able to throw myself into any thing
but Death that could be call'd worse; that if I
reach'd the Shore of the Main, I might, perhaps,
meet with Relief, or I might coast along, as I did
on the Shore of Afrkk, 'till I came to some inha-
bited Country, and where I might find some Re-
lief; and after all, perhaps I might fall in with
some Christian Ship that might take me in; and
if the worse came to the worst, I could but die,
which would put an End to all these Miseries at
once. Pray Note, All this was the Fruit of a dis-
turb'd Mind, an impatient Temper, made as it
were desperate by the long Continuance of my
Troubles, and the Disappointments 1 had met in
the Wreck I had been on board of, and where I
had been so near the obtaining what I so earnestly
long'd for, viz,. some Body to speak to, and to learn
some Knowledge from, of the Place where I was,
and of the probable Means of my Deliverance;
I fay, I was agitated wholly by these Thoughts:
All my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Pro-
vidence, and waiting the Islue of the Dispositions
of Heaven, seem'd to be suspended; and I had, as-
it were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to any
Thing, but to the Project of a Voyage to the
Main, which came upon me with such Force, and
such an Impetuosity of Desire, that it was not to
be resisted.
j When
When this had agitated my Thoughts for two
Hours, or more, with such Violence, that it set
my very Blood into a Ferment, and my Pulse beat
.as high as if I had been in a Fever, merely with
the extraordinary Fervour of my Mind about it;
Nature, as if I had been fatigu'd and exhausted
with the very Thought of it, threw me into a
found Sleep: One would have thought I mould
have dreamt of it; but I did not, nor of any
thing relating to it; but I dreamt, that as I was
goingout in the Morning, as usual, from my Castle,
I saw upon the more two Canoes, and eleven Sava-
ges coming to Land, and that they brought with
them another Savage, who they were going to kill,
in order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the Sa-
vage, that they were going to kill, jump'd away,
and ran for his Lise; and I thought in my Sleep,
that he came running into my little thick Grove,
before my Fortification, to hide himself; and that
I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the
other sought him that way, sl;ew'd myself to him,
and smiling upon him, encourag'd him ; that he
kneel'd down to me, seeming to pray me to assist
him; upon which I shew'd my Ladder, made him
go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he be-
came my Servant; and that as soon as I had got-
ten this Man, I said to myself, now I may certain-
ly venture to the Main Land; for this Fellow
will serve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to
do, and whither to go for Provisions; and whi-
ther not to go for sear of being devour'd, what Pla-
- ces to venture into, and what to escape. I wak'd
with this Thought, and was under such inexpres-
sible Impressions of Joy at the Prospect of my E-
scape in my Dream , that the Disappointments
which I selt upon coming to myself, and finding it
was no more than a Dream, were equally extra-
vagant
vagant the other way, and threw me into a very
great Dejection of Spirit.' «
Upon this, however, I made this Conclusion,
That my only way to go about an Attempt for an
Escape, was, if possible, to get a Savage into my
Possession ; and, if possible, it mould be one of their
Prisoners, whom they had condemn'd to be eaten,
and should bring thither to kill; but these Thoughts
still were attended with this Difficulty, that ft was
impossible to effect this, without attacking a whole
Caravan of them, and killing them all ; and this
was not only a very desperate Attempt, and might
miscarry; but, on the other hand, I had greatly
scrupled the Lawfulness of it to me, and my Heart
trembled at the Thoughts of shedding so much
Blood, tho' it was for my Deliverance. I need
not repeat the Arguments which occur'd to me
against this, they being the fame mention'd before:
But tho* I had other Reasons to osfer now, viz,.
that those Men were Enemies to my Lise, and
would devour me, if they could, that it was Self-
preservation in the highest Degree, to deliver my
self from this Death of a Lise, and was acting in
my own Desence, as much as if they were actually
assaulting me, and the like : I fay, tho'these things
argued sot it, yet the Thoughts of shedding hu-
man Blood for my Deliverance, were very terrible
to me, and such as I could by no Means reconcile
myself to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret Disputes
with myself, and after great Perplexities about
it, (for all these Arguments, one way and another,
struggled in my Head a long time) the eager pre-
vailing Desire of Deliverance at length master'd
all the rest, and I refolv'd, if possible, to get one
pf these Savages, into my Hands, cost what it
would.
would. My next thing then was to contrive how
to do it; and this indeed was very difficult to re-
solve on. Bat as I could pitch upon no probable
Means for it, so I resolv'd to put myself upon the
Watch, to see them when they came on Shore,
and leave the rest to the Event, taking such Mea-
sures as the Opportunity should present, let be
what would be.
With these Resolutions in my Thoughts, I set
myself upon the Scout, as often as possible, and
indeed so often till I was heartily tired of it; for
it was above a Year and a half that I waited, and
for great Part of that Time went out to the West
End, and to the South-West Corner of the Island
almost every Day, to see for Canoes, but none
appear'd. This was very discouraging, and be-
gan to trouble me much; tho' I can't say that it
did in this Case as it had done some time before
that, viz,. wear oft' the Edge of my Desire to the
thing; but the longer it seem'd to be delay'd, the
more eager I was for it: In a Word, I was not at
first so careful to shun the Sight of these Savages,
and avoid being seen by them, as I was now ea-
ger to be upon them.
Besides, I fancied mjself able to manage one,
nay, two or three Savages, if I had them, so as
to make them entirely Slaves to me, to do what-
ever I should direct them, and to prevent their
being able at any time to do me any Hurt. It
was a great while that I pleas'd myself with this
Asfair; but nothing still ptesented; all my Fan-
cies and Schemes came to nothing, for no Sava-
ges came near me for a great while.
About a Year and half after I had entertain'd
theft Notions, and, by long musing, had as it were
resolv'd them all into nothing, for want of an Oc-
casion to put, them in Execution, I was surpriz'd
one
one Morning early, with seeing no less than five
Canoes all on Shore together on my Side the Island,
and the People who belong'd to them all landed,
and out of my Sight: The Number of them broke
all my Measures; for seeing so many, and know-
ing that rhey always came four, or six, or sometimes
more, in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my Measures, to attack twen-
ty or thirty Men single-handed; so I lay still in
my Castle, perplex'd and discomforted; however
I put myself into all the same Postures for an At-
tack, that I had formerly provided, and was just
ready for Action, if any thing had presented. Ha-
ving waited a good while, listening to hear if they
made any Noise, at length being very impatient,
I set my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and
clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill by my two
Stages, as usual, standing so, however, that my
Head did not appear above the Hill; so that they
could not perceive me by any Means: Here I ob-
scrv'd, by the help of my Prospective-Glass, that
they were no less than thirty in Number; that
they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat
dress'd ; how they had cook'd it, that I knew not,
or what it was; but they were all dancing in I
know not how many barbarous Gestures and Fi-^
gures, their own Way, round the Fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceiv'd
by my Prospective two miserable Wretches drag'd
from the Boats, where, it seems, they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the Slaughter. I
perceiv'd one of them immediately sell, being
knock'd down, I suppose with a Club or wooden
Sword, for that was their Way, and two or three
others were at work immediately, cutting him open
for their Cookery, while the other Victim was left
standing by himself, till they should be ready for
him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch fee-
ing himself a little at Liberty, Nature inspir'd him
with Hopes of Lise, and he started away from
them, and ran with incredible Swiftness along the
Sands directly towards me, I mean, towards that
Part of the Coast where my Habitation was.
- I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow-
ledge) when I perceiv'd him to run my Way;
and especially,-when, as I thought, I saw him pur-
sued by the whole Body; and now I expected
that Part of my Dream was coming to pass, and
that he would certainly take shelter in my Grove;
but I could not depend by any means upon my
Dream for the rest of it, viz,. that the other Sa-
vages would not pursue him thither, and find him
there. However, I kept my Station, and my Spi-
rits began to recover, when I found that there was
not above three Men that follow'd him ; and still
more was I encouraged, when I found that he
outstript them exceedingly in running, and gain'd
Ground of them, so that if he could but hold it
for half an Hour, I saw easily he would fairly
get away from them all.
There was between them and my Castle the
Creek which I mention'd often at the first Part of
my Stcry, when I landed my Cargoes out of the
Ship; and this I saw plainly, he must necessarily
swim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken
there: But when the Savage escaping came thi-
ther, he made nothing of it, tho' the Tide was
then up ; but plunging in, swam thro' in about
thirty Strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on
with exceeding Strength and Swiftness; when the
three Persons came to the Creek, I found that
two of them could swim, but the third could not,
and that standing on the other Side, he look'd at
the other, but went no further; and soon afeer went
. scfdy
softly back again, which, as it happen'd, was ve-
. ry well for him in the main.
.' I observ'd, that the two who swam, were yet
more than twice as long swimming over the Creek,
as the Fellow was that sled from them : It came
now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed
irresistibly, that now was my Time to get me a
Servant, and perhaps a Companion, or Assistant;
and that I wascall'd plainly by Providence to save
this poor Creature's Lise; I immediately run down
the Ladders with all possible Expedition, setch'd
my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot
of the Ladders, as I observ'd above ; and getting
up again with the same haste, to the Top of the
Hill, I cross'd toward the Sea; and having a,yerj»
short cut, and all down Hill, clap'd myself in the
Way between the Pursuers and the pursued, hal-
lowing aloud to him that sled, who looking back,
was ac first perhaps as much frighted at me as
at them; but I beckon'd with my Hand to him
to come back, and in the mean time, I slowly ad-
vanced towards the two that follow'd ; then rush-
ing at once upon the foremost, I knock'd him down
with the Stock of my Piece; I was loth to fire, be-
cause I would not have the rest hear; tho' at that
Distance it would not have been easily heard;
and being out of Sight of the Smoak too, they
would not have easily known what to make of it:
Having knock'd this Fellow down, the other who
pursu'd him stopt, as if he had been frighted;
and I advanced apace towards him; but as I came
nearer, I perceiv'd presently, he had a Bow and
Arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me ; sol
was then necessitated to shoot at him first; which
I did, and kill'd him at the first Shoot: The poor
Savage who sled, but had stop'd, tho' he saw both
his Enemies fallen, and kill'd, as he thought, yet
was
was so frighted with the Fire, and Noise of my
Piece, that he stood slock still, and neither came
forward or went backward, tho' he seem'd rather
inclin'd to sly still, than to come on; I hollow'd
again to him, and made Signs to come forward,
which he easily understood, and came a little way,
then stop'd again, and then a little farther, and
stop'd again ; and I could then perceive that he
stood trembling, as if he had been taken Prisoner,
and had just been to be kill'd, as his two Enemies
were ; I beckon'd him again to come to me, and
gave him all the Signs of Encouragement that I
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve Steps, in token
of Acknowledgment for my saving his Lise; Ismil'd
at him, and look'd pleasantly, and beckon'd to him
to come still nearer; at length he came close to me,
and then he kneel'd down again, kiss'd the Ground,
and laid his Head upon the Ground, and taking
me by the Foot, set my Foot upon his Head:
This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my
Slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could : But there
was more Work to do yet, for I perceiv'd the Sa-
vage whom I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but
stun'd with the Blow, and began to come to him-
self; so I pointed to him, and showing him the Sa-
vage, that he was not dead ; upon this he spoke
some Words to me, and tho' I could not understand
them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear,
for they were the first Sound of a Man's Voice that
I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five
Years. But there was no time for such Reslec-
tions now; the Savage, who was knock'd down,
recover'd himself so far, as to sit up upon the
Ground, and I perceiv'd that my Savage began to
be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my
Part I. R other
fine Teeth, well ser, and white as Ivory. After he
had slumber'd, rather than slept, about half an
Hour, he wak'd again, and comes out of the Cave
to me, for I had been milking my Goats, which I
had in the Enclosure just by: When he espy'd me,
he came running to me, laying himself down
again upon the Ground, with all the possible Signs
of an humble thankful Disposition, making a many
antick Gestures to show it: At last he lays his
Head slat upon the Ground, close to my Foot,
and sets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had
done before ; and after this, made all the Signs to
me of Subjection, Servitude, and Submission ima-
ginable, to let me know how he would serve me
as long as he liv'd- I understood him in many
things, and let him know I was very well pleas'd
with him ; in a little time I began to speak to
him, and teach him to speak to me ; and sirst, I
made him know his Name should be Friday, which
was the Day I sav'd his Lise; I call'd him so for
the Memory of the time ; I likewise taught him
to say Master, and then let him know that was to
be my Name; I likewise taught him to say Yes
and No, and to kqow the Meaning of them; I gave
him some Milk in an earthen Pot, and let him see
me drink it befote him, and sop my Bread in it;
and I gave him a Cake of Bread to do the like,
which he quickly comply'd with, and made Signs
that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that Night, but assoon
as it was Day, I beckon'd to him to come with
me, and let him know I would give him some
Cloaths, at which he scem'd very glad, for he was
stark-naked : As we went by the Place where he
had bury'd the two Men,he pointed exactly to the
Place, and shew'd me the Marks that he had
made to find them again, making Signs to me
that we should dig them up again, and eat them}
at this I appear'd very angry, express'd my Ab-
horrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to
him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great Submission. I then led him up to the
Top of the Hill, to see if his Enemies were gone;
and pulling out my Glass, I look'd, and saw plain-
ly the Place where they had been, but no Appea-
rance of them, or of their Canoes; so that it was
plain that they were gone, and had left their two
Comrades behind them, without any Search af-er
them.
But I was not content with this Discovery, but
Having now more Courage,and consequently more
Curiosity, I took my Man Friday with me, giving
him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and
Arrows at his Back, which I found he could use
very dexterously, making him carry one Gun for me,
and I two for myself, and away we march'd to the
Place where these Creatures had been; for I had a
mind row to get some fuller Intelligence of them:
When I came to the Place, my very Blood ran
chill in my Veins, and my Heart funk within me
at the Horror of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a
dreadful Sight, at least it was so to me, tho' Friday
made nothing of it: The Place was cover'd with
human Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood,
great Pieces of Flesh left here and there, half
eaten, mangled and scorch'd; and, in short, all the
Tokens of the triumphant Feast they had been ma-
king there, aster a Victory over their Enemies. I
saw three Skulls, sive Hands, and the Bones of three
or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other Parts
of the Bodies; and Friday, by his Signs, made me
understand, that they brought over four Prisoners
to seast upon; that three of them were eaten up,
R i and
[ z4<S]
and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth:
That there had been a great Battel between them
and their next King, whose Subjects it seems he had
been one of; and that they had taken a great Num-
ber of Prisoners, all which were carried to seve-
ral Places by ,those that had taken them in the
Fight, in order to seast upon them, as was done
here by these Wretches upon those they brought
hither.
I caus'd Friday to gather all the Skulls, Bones,
Flesh, and whatever reraain'd, and lay them to-
gether on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it,
and burn them al) to Ashes: I found Fridayhud still
a hankering stomach after some of the f\eQi, and
was still a Canibal in his Nature; but 1 discover'd
ib much Abhorrence at the very Thoughts of it,
and at the least Appearance of it, that he durst not
discover it; for I had, by some means, let him know
that I would kill him if he ofser'd it.
When we had done this, we came back to our
Castle, and there I sell to work for my Man Fiiiay j
and first of all I gave him a Pair of Linen Drawers,
which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chest I men-
tion'd, and which I found in the Wreck; and which,
with a little Alteration, sitted him very well; then
I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-Skin, as well as my
Skill would allow; and I was now grown a tolerable
good Taylor; and I gave him a Cap, which I had
made of a Hare-skin, very convenient and fashion-
able enough; and thus he was cloath'd, for the
present, tolerably well, and was mighty well plcas'd
to see himselfalmost as well cloath'd as his Master:
Jt's true, he went aukwardly in these things at first;
wearing the Drawers was very aukward to him,
and the Sleeves of the Waistcoat gall'd his Shoul:
Hers, and the inside of his Arms; but a little easing
them, where he complain'd they hurt him, ancj
using himself te them, *t length he took to them
very well.
The next Day after I came Home to my Hutch
with him, I began to consider where I should lodge
him; and that I might do well for him, and yet be
persectly easy my self. I made a little Tent for him
jn the vacant Place between my two Fortisications,
in the Inside of the last, and in the Outside of the
first: And as there was a Door or Entrance there
into my Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door-case,
and a Door to it of Boards, and set it up in the
Passage, a little within the Entrance; and causing
the Door to open on the Inside, I bar'd it up in the
Night, taking in my Ladders too; so that Friday
could no way come at me in the Inside of my inner*
most Wall, without making so much Noise in getting
over, that it must needs waken me; for my first
Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long
Poles, covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the
Side of the Hill, which was again laid cross with
smaller Sticks instead of Laths, and then thatch'd
over a great Thickness with the Rice-Straw, which
was strong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place
which was left to go in or out by the Ladder, I
had plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which if it had
been attempted on the Out-side, would not have
open'd at all, but would have fallen down, and
made a great Noise; and as to Weapons, J took
them all into my Side every Night.
But I needed none of all this Precaution; for
never Man had a more faithful, loving, sincere Ser-
vant than FHtbn was to me; without Passions,
Sullenness, or Designs, persectly oblig'd and en-
gag'd; his very Assections were ty'd to me, like
thpse of a Child to a Father; and I date fay, he
would have sacrisie'd his Life for the saving mine,
upon any Occasion whatsoever: The many Testi-
R 4 monies
monies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt,
and soon convinc'd me, that I needed to use np
Precautions as to my Sasety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe,
and that with wonder, that however it had pleas'd
God in his Providence, and in the Government of
the Works of his Hands, to take from so great a
Part of the World of his Creatures, the best Uses
to which their Faculties, and the Powers of their
Souls are adapted; yet that he has bestow'd upon
them the fame Powers, the fame Reason, the same
Assections, the fame Sentiments of Kindness and
Obligation, the fame Passions and Resentments of
Wrongs, the fame Sense of Gratitude, Sincerity,
Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good,
and receiving Good, that he has given to us; and
that when he pleases to offer them Occasions of
exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready
to apply them to the right Uses for which they
were bestow'd, than we are. And this made me
very melancholy sometimes, in reslecting, as the se-
veral Occasions presented, how mean a Use we
make of all these, even tho' we have these Powers
enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Instruction, the
Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge of his Word,
added to our Understanding; and why it has plea-
sed God to hide the like saving Knowledge from
so many Millions of Souls, who (if I might judge
by this poor Savage) would make a much better
Use of it than we did.
From hence I sometimes was led too far to in-
vade the Sovereignty of Providence; and, as it
were, arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a Disposi-
tion of Things, that should hide that Light from
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like
Duty from both: But I shut it up and check'd my
Thoughts with this Conclusion, First, That we did
nnt
not know by what tight and Law these should be
condemn'd; but that, as God was necessarily, and,
by the Nature of his Being, infinitely holy and just,
so it could not be, but that if these Creatures were
all sentenc'd to absence from himself, it was on ac-
count of sinning against that Light, which, as the
Scripture fays, was a Law to themselves, and by
such Rules as their Consciences would acknowledge
to be just, tho' the Foundation was not discovers
to us: And, Secondly, That still as we are all the
Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no. Veslel could
fay to him, Why hast thou form'd me thus?
But to return to my new Companion: I was
greatly delighted with him, andmade it my Busi-
ness to teach him every thing that was proper to
make him useful, handy and helpful; but especially
to make him speak, and understand me when I
speak; and he was the aptest Scholar that ever
was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly
diligent, and so pleas'd when he could but under-
stand me, or make me understand him, that it was
very pleasant to me to talk to him; and now my
Lise began to be so easy, that 1 began to say to
myself, that could I but have been sase from more
Savages, I cared not if I was never to remove
from the Place while I liv'd.
After I had been two or three Days return'd to
my Castle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid way of seeding, and from the
Relish of aCanibal's Stomach, I ought to let him
taste other Flesh; so I took him out with me one
Morning to the Woods. 1 went, indeed, intending
to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring it
home and dress it: But as I was going, I saw a
She-Goat lyingdown in the Shade, and two young
Kids sitting by her. I catch'd hold of Friday,
hold, fays I, stand still; and made Signs to him
not
not to stir, immediately I presented my Piece, shot
and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature,
who had at a Distance, indeed, seen me kill the Sa-
vage, his Enemy, but did not know, or could i-
magine how it was done, was sensibly surpriz'd,
trembled and shook, and look'd so amaz'd, that I
thought he would have sunk down. He did not
see the Kid I had (hot at, or perceive I-had kill'd
it, but rip'd up his Waistcoat to seel if he was not
wounded; and as I found, presently thought I was
tesolv'd to kill him; for he came and kneel'd down
to me, and embracing my Knees, said a great
many Things I did not understand, but I could
easily see that the Meaning was to pray me not to
kill him.
I soon sound a Way to convince him that I would
do him no Harm, and raking him up by the Hand,
laugh'd at him, and pointing to the Kid which I
had kill'd, beckon'd to him, to run and setch ir,
which he did; and while he was wondering and
looking to see how the Creature was kill'd, I loaded
my Gun again, and by-and-by I saw a great Fowl,
like a Hawk, sit upon a Tree within shot; so, to
let Friday understand a little what I would do, I
call'd him to me again, pointing at the Fowl,
which was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had
been a Hawk; I fay, pointing to the Parrot, and to
my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to
let him see I would make it fall, I made him un*
derstand that I would shoot and kill that Bird; ac-
cordingly I iir'd, and bad him look, and immediater
ly he saw the Parrot fall; he stood like one fright-
ed again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and
I found he was the more amaz'd, because he did not
see me put any thing into the Gun; but thought
that there must be some wonderful Fund of Death
and Destruction in that Thing, able to kill Man,
Beast, Bird, or any thing near or far osf; and the
Astonishment this created in him was such, as
could not wear oft'for a long time; and I believe,
if I would have let him, he would have worship'd
me and my Gun: As for the Gun it self, he would
not so much as touch it for several Days after; but
would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
swer'd him, when he was by himself; which as I
afterwards learn'd of him, was to desire it not to
kill him.
Well: After his Astonishment was a little over
at this, I pointed to him to run and setch the
Bird I had shot, which he did, hut stay'd some
Time; for the Parrot not being quite dead, was
slutter'd a good way osf from the Place where
she sell; however, he found her, took her up,
and brought her to me; and, as I had perceiv'd
bis Ignorance about the Gun before, I rook this
Advantage to charge the Gun again, and not let
him see me do it, that I might be ready for any
other Mark that might present; but nothing more
effer'd at that Time; so I brought home the Kid,
and the same Evening I took the Skin osf, and cue
it out as well as I could; and having a Pot foe
that Purpose, I boil'd or slew'd some of the Flesh,
and made some very good Broth 5 and after I had
begun to eat some, I gave some to my Man, who
seera'd very glad of it, and lik'd it very well ; hue
that which was strangest to him, was to sec mo
eat Salt with it; he inade a sign to me, that thp
Salt was not good to eat, and putting a little in-
to his own Mouth, he scem'd to nauseate it, and
would spit and sputter at it, washing his Mouth,
with fresh Watet after it; on the other hand, I took
some Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of Salt, as fast as
he had done at the gait; but it would not do, he
would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his
Broth; at least, not a great while, and then but
a very little.
Having thus sed him with boil'd Meat and
Broth, I was resolv'd to seast him the next Day
with roasting a Piece of the Kid; this I did by
hanging it before the Fire in a String, as I had seen
many People do in England, setting two Poles up,
one on each lide. the Fire, and one cross on the
top, and tying the String to the crose Stick, let-
ting the Meat turn continually: This Friday ad-
mir'd very much; but when he came to taste the
Flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well
he lik'd it, that I could not but understand him;
and at last he told me he would never eat Man's
Flesti any more, which I was very glad to hear.
The next Day I set him to work to beating some
Corn our, and lifting it in the manner I used to do,
as I obscrv'd before; and he soon understood how
to do it as well as I, especially, after he had seen
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to
make Bread of; for after that I let him see me make
my Bread, and bake it too; and in a little Time
Friday was able to do all the Work for me, as well
as I could do it my self.
I began now to cons!der,that having two Mouths
to seed instead of one, I must provide more Ground
for my Harvest, and plant a larger Quantity of
Corn than I used to do; so I mark'd out a larger
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the same
manner as before, in which Friday not only work'd
very willingly and very hard, but did it very
chearfully; and I told him what it was for, that it
was for Corn to make more Bread, because he was
now with me, and that I might have enough for
him and myself too: He appear'd very sensible of
that Parr, and let me know, that he. thought I had
. . . much
much more Labour upon me on his Account, than
I had for myself; and that he would work the
harder for me, is I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest Year of all the Lise I
led in this Place: Friday began to talk pretty well,
and understand the Names of almost every thing I
had occasion to call for, and of every Place I had
to send him to, and talk a great deal to me; so
that, in short, 1 began now to have some use for my
Tongue again, which indeed I had very little oc-
casion for before; that is to fay, about Speech: Be-
sides the Pleasure of talking to him, I had a singu-
lar Satisfaction in the Fellow himself; his simpld
unseign'd Honesty appear'd to me more and more
every Day, and I began really to love the Creature;
and on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it
was possible for him ever to love any thing before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
Inclination to his own Country again; and having
learn'd him Englijh so well, that he could answer
me almost any Questions, I ask'd him whether the
Nation that he belong'd to never conquer'd in
Battle? At which he fmil'd and said, Yes, yes, w,e
always fight the better; that is, he meant always
get the better in Fight; and so we began the fol-
lowing Discourse. You always sight the better, said
I, How came you to be taken Prisoner then Friday s
Friday. My Nation beat much, for all that.
Master. How beat; if your Nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many than my Nation in
the Place where me was; they take one, two,
three, and me: my Nation over-beat them irt
the yonder Place, where me no was; the ;e my
Nation take one, two, great Thousand.
Master. But why did not your Side rec* 'er you
from the Hands of your Enemies then?
Friday.
Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the Canoe; my Nation have no Canoe
that Time.
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your Na-
tion do with the Men they take? do they carry
them away, and eat them, as these did?
Friday. Yes, my Nation eat Man's too, eat
all up.
Master. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other Place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else Place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here: [Points to the N.
Side of the I/land, -which, it seems, was their Side.}
By this I understood, that my Man Friday had
formerly been among the Savages, who used to
come on Shore on the farther Part of the Island, on
the said Man-eating Occasions that he was now
brought for; and some time after, when I took
the Courage to carry him to that Side, being the
samel formerly mention'd, he presently knew the
Place, and told me, he was there once when they
eat up twenty Men, two Women, and one Child i
He could not tell twenty in Englijh ; but he num-
ber' d them by laying so many Stones in a Row*
and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this Passage, because it introduces
what follows ; that after s had had this Discourse
with him, I ask'd him how far it was from our
Island to the Shore, and whether the Canoes were
not often lost: He told me there was no Danger,
no Canoes ever lost; but that after a little way out
to the Sea, there was a Current, and a Wind al-
ways one way in the Morning, the other in the
Afternoon.
Thil
This I understood to be no more than the Sets of
the Tide, as going out4 or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasion'd by the great
Draft and Reslux of the mighty River Oroonooko;
in the Mouth or the Gulph of which River, as I
thought afterwards, our Island lay; and that this
Land, which I perceiv'd to the W. and N.W. was
the great Island Trinidad, on the North Point of
the Mouth of the River. I ask'd Friday a thousand
Questions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the
Sea, the Coast, and what Nations were near; he
told me all he knew, with the greatest Openness
imaginable. I ask'd him the Names of the seve-
ral Nations of his fort of People, but could get
no other Name than Caribs; from whence I easi-
ly understood, that these were the Caribbees, which
our Maps place on the Part of America, which
reaches rrom the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to
Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha: He told me
that up a great way beyond the Moon, that was^
beyond the setting of the Moon, which must be
W. from their Country, there dwelt white-beard-
ed Men, like me; and pointed to my great Whis-
kers, which I mention'd before; and that they
had kill'd much Mans, that was his Word : By all
which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose
Cruelties in America had been spread over the
whole Countries, and were remember'd by all the
Nations from Father to Son.
I enquir'd if he could tell me how I might
come from this Island, and get among those white
Men; he told me, Yes, yes, I might go in tuo
Canoe; I could not understand what he meant,
or make him describe to me what he meant by
two Canoe, till at last, with great Disficulty, I
found he meant it must be in a large great Boat,
asbigasfuie Canoes.
This

This Part of Fridays Discourse began to relish
with me very well; and from this time I enter-
tain'd some Hopes, that one time or other I
might find an Opportunity to make my Escape
from this Place, and that this poor Savage might
be a means to help me to do it.
Duting the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a Foun-
dation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; par-
ticularly, I ask'd him one time, who made him?
The poor Creature did not understand me at all,
but thought I had ask'd who was his Father: But
I took it by another Handle, and ask'd him who
made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd on, and the
Hills and Woods? He told me, it was one old i
Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He could de-
scribe nothing of this great Person, but that he was
very old; much older, he said, than the Sea or the
Land, than the Moon or the Stars. I ask'd him
then, if this old Person had made all tilings, why
did not all things worship him? He look'd very
grave, and with a persect Look of Innocence, said,
AU things said 0 to him. I ask'd him, if the People -
who die in his Country, went away any whete?
He said, Yes, they all went to Benamuckee. Then
I ask'd him, whether these they eat up went thi-
ther too? He said, Yes.
From these Things I began to instruct him in ^
the Knowledge of the true God. I told him, that .
the great Maker of all Things lived up there,
pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs; .,
the World by the fame Power and Providence by .
which he had made it: That he was Omnipotent,
could do every thing for us, give every thing to
us,, take every thing from us; and thus, by de-
grees, I open'd his Eyes. He listen'd with great
Atten-
['*57.}
Attention* and received with Pleasure the Notion
of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the
manner of making our Prayers to God, and his
being able tcthear us, even into Heaven. He told
me one Day, that if our God could hear us up
beyond the Sun, he must needs be a greater God
than their Benamuckee, who liv'd but a little way
osf, and yet could not hear, till they went up to
the great Mountains where he dwelt, to speak
to him. I ask'd him, if ever he went thither to
speak to him. He said, No, they never went that
were young Men; none went thither but the old
Men, who he call'd their Oowokakee, that is, as I
made him explain it to me, their Religious, or
Clergy, and that they went to fay 0, (so he call'd
saying Prayers) and then came back, and told them
what Benamuckee hid. By this I observ'd, that there
is Priestcraft even amongst the most blinded igno-
rant Pagans in the World, and the Policy of
making a secret Religion, in order to preserve
the Veneration of the People to the Clergy, is
not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all Religions in the World, even among
the most brutish and barbarous Savages.
I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud to my
Man Friday, and told him, That the Pretence of
their old Men going up to the Mountains to fay O
to their God Benamuckee, was a Cheat, and their
bringing Word from thence what he said, was
much more so; that if they met with any Answer,
^or spoke with any one there, it must be with an
evil Spirit: And then I entcr'd into a long Dis-
course with him about the Devil, the Original of
him, his Rebellion against God, his Enmity to
Man, the Reason of it, his setting himself up in
the dark Parts of the World to be worship'd in-
stead of God, and as God ; and the many Strata-
Part I. S gems
gems he made use os, to delude Mankind to their
Ruin; how he had a secret Access to our Passions,
and to our Assections, to adapt his Snares so to
our Inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own
Tempters, and to run upon our Destruction by
our own Choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right No-
tions in his Mind about the Devil, as it was about
the Being of a God. Nature assisted all my Argu-
ments to evidence to him even the Necessity ot a
great first Cause, and over-ruling governing Power,
a secret directing Providence, and of the Equity
and Justice of paying Homage to him that made
us, and the like. But there appear'd nothing of
all this in the Notion of an evil Spirit, of his Ori-
ginal, his Being, his Nature, and above all, of his
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do
so too. And the poor Creature puzzled me once
in such a manner, by a Question merely natural
and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to
him. I had been talking a great deal to him ot
the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dread-
ful Aversion to Sin, his being a consuming Fire to
the Workers of Iniquity; how, as lie had made
us all, he could destroy us and all the World in a
Moment; and he listen'd with great Seriousness to
me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the De-
vil was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and
us'd all his Malice and Skill to deseat the good
Designs of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom
of Christ in the World, and the like. Well, fays
Friday, but you fay, God is so strong, so great, is
he not much strong, much might as the Devil?
Yes, yes, fays I, Friday, God is stronger than the
Devil, God is above the Devil, and therefore we
pray to God to tread him down under our Feet,
I and
and enable us to resist his Temptations, and quench
his fiery Darts. But, fays he again, if God much
strong, much might as the Devil, why God no kill the
Devil, so make him no more do wicked?
I was strangely lurpriz'd at his Question, and
after all, tho' I was now an old Man, yet I was
but a young Doctor, and ill enough qualisied for
a Casuist, or a Solver of Disficulties: And, at first,
I could not tell what to fay; so 1 pretended not to
hear him, and ask'd him what he slid: But he
was too earnest for an Answer to forget his Ques-
tion; so that he repeated'it in the very fame broken
Words, as above. By this time I had recover'd
myself a little, and I said, God will at last punijli
him severely, he is reserv'd for the 'Judgmem, and is
to be cast into the bottomless Pit, to dwell with ever-
lasting Fire. This did not satisfy Friday, but he re-
turns upon me, repeating my Words, Reserve
At L a s Tj me no understand; But why net kill the
Devil now, not kill great ago? You may as well ask
me, said I, why God does not kill you and I,
when we do wicked things here that ossend him:
We are preserv'd to repent and be pardon'd. He
muses a while at this; Well, well, fays he, mighty
assectionately, that well; so you, I, Devil, all wick-
ed, all preserve, repent, God pardon all. Here I was
run down again by him to the last degree, and it
was a Testimony to me, how the mere Notions
of Nature, tho' they will guide reasonable Crea-
tures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Wor-
ship or Homage due to the Supreme Being of God,
as the Consequence of our Nature ; yet nothing but
divine Revelation can form the Knowledge of Je-
fm Christ,and of a Redemption purchas'd for us,of a
Mediator of the new Covenanted of anlntercesl'or,
at the Footstool of God's Throne; I fay, nothing
but a Revelation from Heaven can form these in
S 2 the
the Soul; and that therefore the Gospel of our
Lord and Saviour Jesm Christ, I mean, the Word
of God, and the Spirit of God, promis'd for the
Guide and Sanctisier of his People, are the abso-
lutely necessary Instructors of the Souls of Men
in the saving Knowledge of God, and the means
of Salvation.
I therefore diverted the present Discourse be-
tween me and my Man, rising up hastily, as upon
some sudden Occasion of going out; then sending
him for something a good way off, I seriously pray'd
to God, that he would enable me to instruct saving-
ly this poor Savage, assisting by his Spirit the
Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the
Light of the Knowledge of God in Christ, recon-
ciling him to himself, and would guide me ro speak
so to him from the Word of God, as his Consci-
ence might be convine'd, his Eyes open'd, and his
Soul sav'd. When he came again to me, I enter'd
into a long Discourse with him upon the Subject
of the Redemption of Man by the Saviour of the
World, and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd
from Heaven, viz,. of Repentance towards God,
and Faith in our blessed Lord Jesm. I then ex-
plain' d to him, as well as I could, why our blessed
Redeemer took not on him the Nature of An-
gels, but the Seed of Abraham^ and how for that
Reason the fallen Angels had no Share in the Re-
demption; that he came only to the lost Sheep of
the House of Israel, and the like.
I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Know-
ledge, in ail the Methods I took for this poor
Creatures Instruction, and must acknowledge what
I believe all that act upon the fame Principle will
find, that in laying Tilings open to him, I really
rnfoim'dandinltructed myself in many things, that
cither I did not know, or iy,d not fully consider'd
before;
before; but which occurr'd naturally to my mind,
upon my searching into them, for the Information
of this poor Savage; and I had more Assection in
my Enquiry after Things upon this Occasion, than
ever I selt before; so that whether this poor wild
Wretch was the better for me or no, I had great
Reason to be thankful that ever he came to me:
My Grief set lighter upon me, my Habitation
grew comfortable to be beyond measure; and
when I reslected that in this solitary Lise which I
had been confined to, I had not only been mov'd
myself to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the
Hand that had brought me there, but was now
to be made an Instrument, under Providence, to
save the Lise, and, for ought 1 know, the Soul os 2
poor Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge
of Religion, and of the Christian Doctrine, that he
might know Christ Jesus, to whom is Life eternal.
I fay, when I reslected upon all these things, a se-
cret Joy run thro' every Part of my Soul, and I
frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this
Place, which I had so often thought the most
dreadful of all Asflictions that could possibly have
befallen me. >
In this thankful Frame I continued all the Re-
mainder of my Time, and the Conversation which
employ'd the Hours between Friday and I, was
such, as made the three Years which we liv'd there
together, persectly and compleatly happy, // any
such Thing as compleat Happiness can be form d in a sub-
lunary State. The Savage was now a good Chri-
stian, a much better than I; tho' I have Reason
to hope, and bless God for it, that we were equal-
ly penitent, and comforted restored Penitents:
We had here the Word of God to read, and no
farther osf from his Spirit to instruct, than if we
had been in England.
S 3 I al-
I always apply'd my self to reading the Scrip-
ture, to let him know, as well as I could, the
Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his se-
rious Enquiries and Questions, made me, cu Isaid
before,a.much better Scholar in the Scripture-Know-
ledge, than I should ever have been by my own
private meer reading. Another thing I cannot re-
frain from observing here also from Experience, in
this retired part of my Lise, viz,. How infinite
and inexpressible a Blessing it is, that the Know-
ledge of God, and of the Doctrine of Salvation by
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word
of God, so easy to be receiv'd and understood,
that as the bare reading the Scripture made me ca-
pable of understanding enough of my Duty to car-
ry me directly on to the great Work of sincere Re-
pentance for my Sins, and laying hold of a Saviour
tor Lise and Salvation, to a stated Reformation
in Practice, and Obedience to all God's Com-
mands, and this without any Teacher or Instruc-
ter (1 mean, humane ) so the fame plain Instruc-
tion sufficiently serv'd to the enlightning this sa-
vage Creature, and bringing him to be such a
Christian, as I have known sew equal to him in
my Lise.
As to all the Disputes, Wranglings, Strise, and
Contention, which has happen'd in the World about
Religion.whether Niceties in Doctrines,orSchemes
of Church-Government, they were all persectly
useless to us, as, for ought I can yet see, they have
been to all the rest in the World: We had the sure
Guide to Heaven, w'z,. the Word of God; and we
had, bkjsed be God, comfortable Views of the Spi-
rit of God, teaching and instructing us by his Word,
leading w into all Truth, and making us both wil-
ling and obedient to the Instruction of his Word;
and I cannot see the least Use that the greatest
Jf^nowr
Knowledge os the disputed Points in Religion,
which have made such Confusions in the World,
would have been to us, if we could have obtain'd
it: But I mult go on with [the Historical Part of
Things, and take every Part in its Order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all
1 said to him, and speak sluently, tho' in broken
Englijh, tome; I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at least so much of it as related to my
coming into the Place, how I had liv'd there, and
how long. I let him into the Mystery , for such
it was to him, of Gunpowder and Bullet, and
taught him how to Ihoot: I gave him a Knise,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I
made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, such
as in England we wear Hangers in; and in the Frog,
instead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which
was not only as good a Weapon in some Cases, but
much more useful upon other Occasions.
I describ'd to him the Country of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
liv'd, how we worship'd God, how we behav'd to
one another; and how we traded in Ships to all
Parts of the World: I gave him an Account of the
Wreck which I had been on board of, and sliew'd
him as near as I could the Place where she lay;
but (he was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.
I shew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which we
lost when we eseap'd, and which I could not stir
with my whole Strength then, but was now fallen
almost all to Pieces: Upon seeing this Boat, Friday
stood musing a great while, and said nothing; I
ask'd him what it was he study'd upon; at last, fays
he, me see such Boat like come to Place at my Nation.
I did not understand him a good while; but at
last, when I had examin'd further iuto it, I under-
S 4 stood
I
stood by him, that a Boat, such as that had been,
came on store upon the Country where he liv'd;
that is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by
stress of Weather: I presently imagin'd, that some
European Ship must have been cast away upon their
Coast, and the Boat might get loose, and drive a-
stiore, but was so dull, that I never once thought
of Men making escape from a Wreck thither,
much less whence they might come; so I only en-
quir'd after a Description of the Boat.
Friday dtknb'd the Boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him, when he ad-
ded, with some Warmth, vie save the white Marts
from drown: Then I presently ask'd him, if there
were any white Mans, as he call'd them, in the
Boat? Yes, he said, the BMt full of .white Mans. I
ask'd him how many? He told upon his Fingers
seventeen. I ask'd him then what became of'em?
He told me, they live, they dwell at my Nation.
This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I
presently imagin'd, that these might be the Men
belonging to the Ship that was cast away in sight
of my Island, as I now call it; and who, after the
Ship was struck on the Rock, and they saw her
inevitably lost, had sav'd themselves in their Boat,
and were landed upon that wild wore, among the
Savages.
Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically,
what was become of them; he assur'd me they
liv'd still there; that they had been there about
four Years; that the Savages let them alone, and
gave them Victuals to live. I ask'd him, how it
came to pass they did not kill them and eat them?
He said, No, they make Brother with them; that is,
as I understood him, a Trace: And then he ad-
ded, fhey no eat Mans but when make the War fight .'
That is tp fay, they never eat any Men, but
, siich as come to fight with them, and are taken
in Battel.
It was after this, some considerable Time, that
being on the Top of the Hill, at the East side
of the Island, from whence, as I have said, I had
in a clear Day discover'd the Main or Continent
of America; Friday, the Weather being very serene,
looks very earnestly towards the main Land, and
jn a kind of Surprize falls a jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me, for I was at some Distance
from him: I ask'd him what was the Matter; O
Joy! fays he, 0 Glad! 'There see my Country, there
my Nation!
I observ'd an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure ap-
pear'd in his Face, and his Eyes sparkled, and his
Countenance discover'd a strange Eagerness, as if
he had a mind to be in his own Country again;
and this Observation of mine put a great many
Thoughts into me, which made me at first not so
easy about my new Man Friday as I was before;
and I made no doubt, but that if Friday could get
back to his own Nation again, he would not only
forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to
me; and would be forward enough to give his
Countrymen an Account of me, and come back
perhaps, with a Hundred or two of them, and
make a Feast upon me, at which he might be as
merry as he used to be with those of his Enemies,
when they were taken in War.
But I wrong'd the poor honest Creature very
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards.
However as my Jealousy increas'd, and held me
some Weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before; in
which I was certainly in the wrong too, the ho-
nest grateful Creature having no Thought about it,
but what consisted with the best Principles, both
as
as a religious Christian, and as a grateful Friend,
as appear'd afterwards to my full Satisfaction.
While my Jealousy of him lasted, you may be
sure I was every day pumping him to see if he
would discover any of the new Thoughts, which
1 suspected were in him; but I found every thing
he said was so honest, and so innocent, that I
could find nothing to nourish my Suspicion; and,
in spite of all my Unealiness, he made me at last
entirely his own again; nor did he in the least
perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could
not suspect him of Deceit.
One Day, walking up the same Hill, but the
Weather being hazy at Sea, so that we could not
see the Continent, I call'd to him, and said, Fri-
day, do not you wish your self in your own Coun-
try, your own Nation? Yes, he said, 1 be much 0
glad to be at my own Nation. What would you do
there said I, would you turn wild again, eat Mens
Flesh again, and be a Savage as you were before?
He look'd full of Concern, and shaking his Head,
said, No, no, Friday tell them to live good, tell them
lo pray God, tell them to eat Com-bread, Cattle-flejh,
Milk, no eat Man again: Why then, said I to him,
"they will kill you. He look'd grave at that, and
then said, No, they no kill me, they willing love learn:
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn.
He added) they learn'd much of the bearded Mans
that came in the Boat. Then I ask'd him if he
would go back to them? He smil'd at that, and
told me he could not swim so far. I told him I
would make a Canoe for him. He told me, he
would go, if I would go with him. I go . fays I,
why, they will eat me if I come there: No, no,
fays he, me make they no eat you, me make they much
love you. He meant, he would tell them howl had
kill'd his Enemies, and sav'd his Lise, and so he
would
would make them love methen he told me, as
well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen
white Men, or bearded Men, as he call'd them,
who came on shore there in distress.
From this Time, I consess, I had a mind to
venture over, and see if I could possibly join with
these bearded Men, who, I made no doubr, were
Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but,is I could,
wcmight find some Method to escape from thence,
being upon the Continent, and a good Company
together, better than I could from an Island forty
Miles off the Shore, and alone without Help. So,
after some Days, I took Friday to work again, by
way of Discourse, and told him, I would give him
a Boat to go back to his own Nation; and ac-
cordingly I carry'd him to my Frigate, which lay
on the other side of the Island, and having clear'd
it of Water; for I always kept it funk in the Wa-
ter, I brought it out, shew'd it him, and we both
went into it.
1 found he was a most dextrous Fellow at ma-
naging it, would make it go almost as swift and
fast again as I could; so when he was in, I said to
him, Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your Na-
tion? He look'd very dull at my saying so, which,
it seems, was because he thought the Boat too
small to go so far. I told him then I had a big-
ger; so the next Day I went to the Place where
the first Boat lay which I had made, but which I
could not get into the Water; he said that was big
enough; but then, as I had taken no Care of it,
and it had lain two or three and twenty Years'
there, the Sun had split and dry'd it, that it was
in a manner rotten. Friday told me, such a Boat
would do very well, and would carry much enough
fettle, Drink, Bread, that was his way ofTalking.
Uporj
Upon the Whole, I was by this Time so fix'd
upon my Design of going over with him to the
Continent, that I told him we would go and make
one as big as that, and he should go home in it.
He answer'd not one Word, but look'd very grave
and sad: I ask'd him what was the Matter with
him; he ask'd me again thus, Why you angry mad
viitb Friday, what me done? I ask'd him what he
meant; I told him I was not angry with him at ajl:
No angry! No angry! fays he, repeating the Words
several times, Why send Friday home away to my
Nation? Why, fays I, Friday, did you not fay you
wish'd you were there? Yes, yes, fays he, wijh be both
there, no wijh Friday the re, no Mafter there. In a
word, he would not think of going there without
me: I go there, Friday, fays I, what shall I do
there? He turn'd very quick upon me at this: Tou
do great deal much Good, fays he, you teach wild Maw
be good fiber tame Mam; you tell them know God,
fray God, and live new Life. Alas, Friday, fays I,
thou knowest not what thou fay'st, I am but an
ignorant Man myself. Yer, yes, fays he, you teachee
me Good, you teachee them Good. No, no, Friday,
fays I, you shall go without me, leave me here to
live by my self, as I did before. He look'd confus'd
again at that Word, and running to one of the
Hatchets, which he us'd to wear, he takes it up
hastily, and gives it me; what must I do with this?
fays 1 to him: You take kill Friday, fays he: What
must I kill you for? said I again. He returns ve-
ry quick, What you fend Friday away for? take kill
Friday, no fend Friday away. This he spoke so
earnestly, that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes. In a
word, I so plainly difeover'd the utmost Assection
in him to me, and a/firm Resolution in him, that
I told him then, and often after, that I would ne-
ver send him away from me, if he was willing to
stay with me. Upon
U pon the whole, as found by all his Discourse
a settled Affection to me, and that nothing should
part him from me, so I found all the Foundation
of his Defire to go to his own Country, was laid
in his ardent Affection to the People, and his Hopes
of my doing them good; a Thing, which as I had
no Notion of myself, so I had not the least Thought
or Intention, or Desire of undertaking it. But still
I found a strong Inclination to my attempting an
Escape, as above, founded on the Supposition ga-
ther'd from the Discourse, viz,. That there were
seventeen bearded Men there, and therefore, with-
out any more Delay, I went to work with Friday
to find out a great Tree proper to sell, and make a
large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voy-
age. There were Trees enough in the Island to
have built a little Fleet, not of Periagua's and Ca-
noes, but even of good large Vessels. But the main
Thing I look'd at, was to get one so near the Wa-
ter that we might launch it when it was made, to
avoid the Mistake I committed at first.
Atlast,Fn^pitch'd upon a Tree, for I found he
knew much better than I what kind of Wood was
fittest for it; nor can I tell, tothisDay, what Wood
to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the Tree we call Fustic, or between that
and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the
fame Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the
Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it foe
a Boat: But I shew'd him how rather to cut it out
with Tools, which after I had shew'd him how
to use, he did very handily, and in about a Months
hard Labour we finish a it, and made it very
handsome, especially when with our Axes, which I
shew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the
Out-side into the true Shape of a Boat; after this,
however, it cost us near a Fortnight's Time to gee
her along, as it were, Inch by Inch upon great
Rowlers into the Water. But when die was in,
she would have carry'd twenty Men with great
Ease.
When she was in the Water, and tho' she was so
big, it amaz'd me to see with what Dexterity and
how swift my Man Fnday would manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along; so I ask'd him if he
would, and if we might venture over in her; Yes,he
said, lie venter over in her very vx!I, though great How
Wind. However, I had a farther Design that he
knew nothing or, and that was to make a Mast and
Sail,and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable: As
to a Mast, that was easy enough to get; so I pitch'd
upon a strait young Cedar-Tree, which Ifound near
the Place, and which there was great Plenty of
in the Island ; and I set Friday to Work to cut it
down, and gave him Directions how to shape and
order it. But as to the Sail, that was my particular
Care ; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces of
old Sails enough; but as I had had them now i6
Years by me, and had not been very careful to pre-
serve them, not imagining that I should ever have
this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they
were all rotten ; and indeed most of them were so;
however, I found two Pieces which appear'd pret-
ty good, and with these I went to work, and with
a great deal of Pains, and aukward tedious
stitching (you may be sure) for Want of Needles,I
at length made a three-corner'd ugly Thing, like
what we call in England, a Shoulder of Mutton
Sail, to go with a Boom at Bottom, and a little
stiort Sprit at the Top, such as usually our Ships
Long-Boats fail with, and such as I belt knew how
to manage; because ic was such a one as I had
to the Boat in which I made my Escape from Bar-
bary, as related in the first Part of my Story..
I was
I was near two Months performing this last
Work,we. rigging and fitting my Mast and Sails;
for I finish'd them very compleat, making a small
Stay, and a Sail, or Foresail to it, to assist, if we
should turn to Windward; and which was more
than all, I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern of her. to
steer with ; and tho' I was but a bungling Ship-
wright, yet as I knew the Usefulness, and even
Necessity of such a Thing, I apply'd myself with
so much Pains to do it, that at last I brought it
to pass, tho' considering the many dull Contri-
vances I had for it that fail'd, I think it cost me
almost as much Labour as making the Boat,
After all this was done too, I had my Man Fri-
day to teach as to what belong'd to the Navigation
of my Boat; for tho' he knew very well how to
paddle the Canoe, he knew nothing what belong'd
to a Sail and a Rudder, and was the most amaz'd
when he saw me work the Boat too and again in
the Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gyb'd,
and fill'd this Way or that Way, as the Course, we
fail'd, chang'd; I say, when he saw this, he stood
like one astonish'd and amaz'd: However, with
a little Use, I made all these Things familiar to
him; and he became an expert Sailor, except that
as to the Compass, I could make him understand
very little of that. On the other Hand, as there
was very little cloudy Weather, and seldom or ne-
ver any Fogs in those Parts, there was the less
Occasion for a Compass, feeing the Stars were
always to be seen by Night, and the Shore by
Day, except in the rainy Seasons, and then no
Body cared to stir abroad, either by Land or Sea.
I was now enter'd on the seven and twentieth
Year of my Captivity in this Place ; though the
three last Years that I had this Creature with me,
ought rather to be left out of the Account, my Ha-
bitation
bitation being quite of another kind than in all the
rest of the time. I kept the Annivetsary of my
landing here with the fame Thankfulness to God\. I
for his Mercies, as at first; and if I had such Cause
of Acknowledgment at first, I had much more so
now, having such additional Testimonies of the
Care of Providence over me, and the great Hopes
I had of being esfectually and speedily deliver'd;
for I had an invincible Impression upon my
Thoughts, that my Deliverance was at hand, and
that I mould not be another Year in this Place:
However, I went on with my Husbandry, dig-
ging, planting, sencing, as usual; I gather'd and
cur'd my Grapes, and did every necessary Thing,
as before.
The rainy Season was in the mean time upon
me, when I kept more within Doors than at other
Times; so I hadstow'd our new Vessel as secure as
we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where,
as I said in the beginning, I landed my Rafts from
the Ship, and baling her up to the Shore, at high
Water Mark, I made my Man Friday dig a little
Dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep
enough to give her Water enough to sloat in; and
then, when the Tide was out, we made a strong
Dam cross the End of it to keep the Water out;
and so siie lay dry, as to the Tide, from the Sea;
and to keep the Rain off, we laid a great many
Boughs of Trees so thick, that she was as well
thatch'd as a House and thus we waited for the
Month of November and December, in which I de-
fign'd to make my Adventure.
When the settled Season began to come in, as
the Thought of my Design return'd with the fair
Weather, 1 was preparing daily for the Voyage;
and the first Thing I did, was to lay by a certain
Quantity of Provisions, being the Stores for eur
Voyage; and intended, in a Week or a Fortnight's
Time,
•time, to bpen the Dock, and launch out our Boat
I was busy one Morning upon something of this
^cind, when I call'd to Friday, and bid him go to the
* Searsbore, and see if he could sind a Turtle, or
Tortoise, a Thing which we generally got once i
Week, for the sake of the Eggs, as werf as the
Flesh; Friday had not been long gone, when he
came running back, and slew over my outer Wall,
or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the
Steps he1 set his Feet on ,• arid before I had Time to
speak tO him, he cries out to me, 0 Master! 0 Ma-
ster1. OSorrowl Obadl What's the matter, Friday?
lays I; Oyonder, there, fays he, one, two, three Canoe I
one, two, three! By his way of speaking I conclu-
ded there were six; but on Enquiry I found it was
but three: Well, Friday fays I, do not be frighted;
so I heartet/d him up as well as I could: However,
i saw the poor Fellow was most terribly scared; set
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to
look for him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat
him; and the poor Fellow trembled so, that I
scarce khevv what to do with him i I comforted him
as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
Danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as
him; hit, fays I, Friday we mu(l refihe to fight them;
Can you fight, Friday? Me Jboct, fays he, but there
come many great Number. No matter for that, said
1 again, our Guns will fright them that we do not
kill; so I ask'd him, Whether if I resolv'd to desend
him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do
just as I bid him? He said, Me die, when you bid die,
Master; so I went and setch'd a good Dram of
Rum, and gave him; for I had been so good a Hus-
band of rny Rum, that I had a great deal left i
When he had drank it, I made him take the two
Fowh'ng-Pieces, which we always carry'd, and load
them with large Swsn-Shot, as big-as small Pistol
T Bullets;

Bullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded
them with two Slugs, and five small Bullets each;
and my two Pistols I loaded with a brace of Bul-
lets each: 1 hung my great Sword as usual, naked
by my side, and gave Friday his Hatchet.
When I had thus prepar'd my self, I took my Per-
spective Glass, and went up to the side of the Hill,
to see what I could discover; and I found quickly,
by my Glass, that there were one and twenty Sa-
vages, three Prisoners, and three Canoes; and that
their whole Business seemed to be the triumphant
Banquet upon these three humane Bodies,(a barba-
rous Feast indeed) but nothing more than as I had
observ'd was usual with them.
I observ'd also, that they were landed not where,
they had done when Friday made his Escape, but
nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and
where a thick Wood came close almost down to the
Sea: This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane
Errand these Wretches came about, fill'd me with
such Indignation, that I came down again to Friday
and told him, I was resolv'd to go down to them,
and kill them all; and ask'd him if he would stand
by me? He has now gotten over his Fright, and
his Spirits being a little rais'd with the Dram I had
given him, he was very chearful, and told me, as
before, he would die, ueben I did die.
in this Fit of Fury, I took first and divided the
Arms which * had charg'd, as before, between us:
I gave Friday one Pistol to stick in his Girdle, and
three Guns upon his Shoulder; and I took one Pi-
stol, and the other three my self; and in this Po-
sture we march'd out: I took a small Bottle of Rum
in my Pocket, and gave Friday a large Bag with
more Powder and Bullet; and as to Orders, I
charged him to keep close behind me, and not to
stir,or shoot, or do any thing, till I bid him; and
,1-1
in the mean time, not to speak a Word: In this
Posture I setch'd a Compass to my Right Hand of
near a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to
get into the Wood; so that I might come within
shot of them before I should be discover'd, which
I had seen by my Glass it was easy to do.
While I was making this March, my former
Thoughts returning, I began to abate my Resolu-
tion; I do not mean, that I entertain'd any Fear
of their Number; for as they were naked, unarm'd
Wretches, 'tis certain I was superior to them; nay,
though I had been alone; but it occur'd to my
Thought*} What Call? What Occasion? much
less, What Necessity, I was in to go and dip my
Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had neither
done or intended me any Wrong? Who, as to me,
were innocent, and whose barbarous Customs were
their own Disaster, being in them a Token indeed
of God's having left them, with the other Nations
of that par^ of the World, to such stupidity, and
to such inhumane Courses; but did not call me to
take upon me to be a Judge of their Actions, much
less an Executioner of his Justice; that whenever
he thought sit, he would take the Cause into his
own Hands, and by National Vengeance punisli
them as a People for National Crimes; but that,
in the mean time, it was none of my Business; that
it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was
a declar'd Enemy, and in a state of War with those
very particular People, and it was lawful for him
to attack them; but I could not fay the fame with
respect to me. These Things were so warmly
press'd upon my Thoughts all the Way as I went,
that I resolv'd I would only go and place myself
near them, that I might observe their barbarous
Feast, and that I would act then as God should
direct; but that unless something osser'dthat was
i.... T s more
more a Call to me than yet I knew os, I would
not meddle with them.
Wich this Resolution I enter'd the Wood, and
with all possible Waryness and Silence (Friday M-
lowing close at my Heels) I march'd till I came j
to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was
next to them; only that one Corner of the Wood
lay between me and them: Here I call'd softly to
Friday, and shewing him a great Tree, which was
just at the Corner of the Wood, I bad him go to
the Tree, and bring me word if he could see there
plainly what they were doing; he did so, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might
be plainly view'd there; that they were all about
their Fire, eating the Flesh of one of their Priso-
ners; and that another lay bound upon the Sand,
a little from them, which he said they would kill
next, and which fir'd all the very Soul within me:
He told me it was not one of their Nation, but one
of the bearded Men, who he had told me ef, that
came to their Country in the Boat: I wass$l'd
with Horror at the very naming the white-bearded
Man, and, going to the Tree, I saw plainly, by my
Glass, a white Man, who lay upon the Beaeh of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet ty'd with
Flags, or Things like Rushes, and that he was an
European, and had Cloaths on.
There was another Tree, and a little Thicket
beyond it, about fifty Yards nearer to them than
the Place where I was, which, by going a little way
about, I saw I might come at undiscover'd, and
that then I should be within half Shot of them; so
I with-held my Passion, though I was indeed en-
rag'd to the highest Degree, and going back about
twenty Faces, I got behind some Busiies, which held
all the way, till I came to the other Tree; and then
I came to a little rising Ground, which gave me a
full
full View of them, at the Distance of about eigh-
ty Yards.
I had now not a Moment to lose; for nineteen
of the dreadful Wretches fate upon the Ground,
all close huddled together, and had just sent the o-
ther two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring
him perhaps Limb by Limb to their Fire ,. and
they were stoop'd down to untie the Bands at his
Feet: I turn'd to Friday, now, Friday, said I, do
as I bid thee; Friday said he would; then, Friday,
fays I, dp exactly as you see me do, fail in no-
thing ,flft[ set down one of the Muskets and the
Fowlin^Piece upon the Ground, and Friday did
the like by his; and with the other Musket I took
my Aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like;
then asking him, If he was ready? he said, Yes;
then fire at them, said I; and the fame Momen?
I fir'd also.
Friday took his Aim so much better than I, that
on the side that he stiot, he kill'd two of them,
and wounded three more; and on my side, I kill'd
one, and wounded two: They were, you may be
sure, in a dreadful Consternation; and all of 'em,
who were not hurt, jump'd up upon their Feet,
but did not immediately know which Way to run,
or which Way to look; for they knew not from
whence their Destruction came: Friday kept his
Eyes close upon me, that as I had bid him, he
might observe what I did; so, as soon as the first
Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and took
up the Fowling-Piece, and Friday did the like; he
see me cock, and present, he did the fame again;
Are you ready? Friday, said I; yes, fays he; let
sly then, fays I, in the Name of God, and with
that I fir'd again among the amaz'd Wretches, and
so did Friday; and as our Pieces were now loaden
with what \ call'd Swan-Shot, or small Pistol Bui-.
T j lets,
lets, we found only two drop; but so many were
wounded, that they ran about yelling and stream-
ing like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miserably
wounded, most os them; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, says I, laying down the discharg'd
Pieces, and taking up the Musket, which was yet
loaden, follow me, fays I; which he did, with a
great deal of Courage; upon which I rush'd out of
the Wood, and shew'd myself, and Friday close at
my Foot: As soon as I perceiv'd they saw me, I
shouted as loud as I could, and bad Fri^$ do so
too; and running as fast as I could, wmfby the
way was not very fast, being loaden with Artns as I
was, I made directly towards the poor Victim, who
was, as I said, lying upon the Beach, or Shore,
between the Place where they sat and the Sea;
the two Butchers, who were just going to work
with him, had left him, at the Surprize of our first
Fire, and sled in a terrible Fright to the Sea-side,
and had jump'd into a Canoe, and three more of the
rest made the fame Way: I turn'd to Friday, and
bid him step forwards, and fire at them; he under-
stood me immediately, and running about forty
Yards to be near them, he shot at them, and I
thought he had kill'd them all: for Isaw. them all
fall of a Heap into the Boat; though I saw two of
them up again quickly: However, he kill'd two
of them, and wounded the third; so that he lay
down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been
dead.
While my Man Friday sir'd at them, I pull'd out
my Knife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor
Victim; and loosing his Hands and Feet, I lifted
him up, and ask'd him in the Portuguese Tongue,
What he was? He answer'd in Latin, Christianus;
but was so weak and faint, that he could scarce
stand, or speak; I took my Bottle out of my Pocket,
and gave it him, making signs that he should
drink, which he did; and I gave him a Piece of
Bread, which he eat; then I ask'd him, What
Countryman he was? And he said, Espagniole; and
being a little recover'd, let me know by all the
signs he could possibly make, how much he was
in my Debt for his Deliverance: Seignior, said I,
with as much Spanijh as I could make up, we will
talk afterwards, but we must sight now; if you
have any_Strength left, take this Pistol and Swordj
and lajsihout you. He took them very thankfully,
and no sooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but
as if they had put new Vigour into him, he slew
upon his Murderers like a Fury, and had cut two
of them in Pieces in an instant; for the Truth is,
as the whole was a Surprize to them, so the poor
Creatures were so much frighted with the Noise of
our Pieces, that they sell down for meer Amaze-
ment and Fear, and had no more Power to at-
tempt their own Escape, than their Fled had to
resist our Shot; and that was the Case of those five
that Friday {hot at in the Boat; for as three of
them sell with the Hurt they receiv'd, so the other
two sell with the Fright.
I kept my Piece in my Hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my Charge ready, because I
had given the Spaniard my Pistol and Sword; so I
call'd to Friday, and bad him run up to the Tree
from whence we first fir'd, and setch the Arms
which lay there, that had been dilcharg'd, which
he did with great Swiftness; and then giving him
my Musket, I fat down myself to load all the rest
again, and bad them come to me when they want-
ed ^ While I was loading these Pieces, there hap-
pen'd a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard
and one of the Savages, who made at him with one of
X 4 tncic
jheir great wooden Swords, the fame Weapon that
was to have kiil'd him before, if I had not prevent-
ed it: The Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave
as could be imagin'd, tho' weak, had fought this
Indian a good while, and had cut him two great
Wounds on his Head; but the Savage being a
flout lusty Fellow, closing in with him, had thrown
him down (being faint) and was wringing my
ySword out or his hand, when the Spaniard, tho' un?
dermost, wifely quitting the Sword, drew the Pistpj
from his Girdle, shot the Savage through the Body,
and kiil'd him upon the Spot, before L who was
running to help him, could come near him.
Friday being now left to his Liberty, purfu'd the
flying Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand, but
his Hatchet; and with that he difpatch'd those
three, who as I said before, were wounded at sirst
and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with;
and the Spaniard coming to me for a Gun, I gave,
him one of the Fowling-Pieces, with which he
purfu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them
both; but as he was not able to run, they both
got from him into the Wood, where Friday purfu'4
them, and kiil'd one of them; but the other was
too nimble for him; and tho'he was wounded, yet
had plung'd himself into the Sea, and swam with
all his Might osf to those two who were left in
the Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one
-wounded, who we know not whether he dy'd or no,
were all that efcap'd our Hands of one and twenty.
The Account of the rest js as follows;
5 Kiil'd at our sirst Shot from the Tree,
j Kiil'd at the next Shot.
2 Kiii'd by Friday in the Boat.
i Kiil'd by Ditto, of those at first wounded.

4 Kill'd, being found dropt here and there of
their Wounds, or kill'd by Friday in his Chaee
of them.
. 4 Escap'd in the Boat, whereof one wounded,
if not dead.
21 Jn all,
Those that were in the Canoe, work'd hard to
get out£f Gun-shot; and tho' Friday made two
or threeThot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them: Friday would fain have had me took
one of their Canoes, and pursued them , and indeed
I was very anxious about their Escape, lest, carry
ipg the News Home to their People, they should
come back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of
their Canoes, and devour us by meer Multitude; Ib
I consented to pursue them by Sea, and running to
one of their Canoes, I jump'd in, and bad Friday
follow me; but when I was in the Canoe, I was
surprized to find another poor Creature lie there
alive, bound Hand and Foot, as the Spaniard was,
for the Slaughter, and almost dead with Fear, not
knowing what the matter was; for he had not been
able to look iy> over the side of the Boat, he was
tied so hard, Neck and Heels, and had been tied fa
long, that he had really little Lise in him.
I inimedjately cut the twisted Flags, or Rushes,
wl«ch they had bound him with, and would have
help'd him up; but he could not stand, or speak,
but groan'd most piteously, believing, it seems, still
that he was only unbound in order to be kill'd-
When Friday came to him, 1 bad him speak to
him, and tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling
out my Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch a
i "'' 1 Z' * T)ram.
Pram, which, with the News of his being deli"
ver'd, revived him, and he fat up in the Boat; but
when Friday came to hear him speak, and look'd
|n his Face, it would have moved any one to Tears
to have seen how F.iddy Jtiss'd him, embraced him,
hugg'd him, cry'd, laugh'd, hollow'd, jump'd a-
bout, danced, fung, then cry'd again, wrung his
Hands, beat his own Face and Head, and then
fung, and jump'd about again, like a distracted
Creature: It was a good while before I could make
him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter;
but when he came a little to himself, he^told me
that it was his Father.
It is not easy for me to express how it moved
me to see. what Extafy and filial Assection had
work'd in this poor Savage, at the sight of his Fa-
ther, and of his being deliver'd from Death; nor
indeed can I describe half the Extravagances of his
Afsection after this; for he went into the Boat and
out of the Boat a gteat many times: When he
went in to him, he would sit down by him, open
his Breast, and hold his Father's Head close to his
Bosom, half an Hour together, to nourish it; then
he took his Arms and Ankles, which were numb'd
and stirs with the binding, and chased and rubbed
them with his Hands; and I perceiving what the
Case was, gave him some Rum out of my Bottle,
to rub them with, which did them a great deal
of good. - -
This Action put an End to our Pursuit of the
Canoe, with the other Savages, who were now
gotten almost out of sight; and it was happy for
us that we did not ; for it blew so hard within two
Hours after, and before they could be gotten a
Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing so
hard all Night, and that from the Nmh-lVeft,
whichwas against them, thatl could not suppose
theit
their Boat could live, or that they ever reach'd to
their own Coast. <
But to return to Friday; he was so busy about
his Father, that I could not find in my Heart to
take him off for some time: But after I thought
he could leave him a little, I call'd him to me,
and he came jumping and laughing, and pleas'd to
the highest Extream: then I ask'd him, If he had
given his Father any Bread? Heshook his Head,
And said, None : Ugly Dog eat all uf self; so I gave
him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carried
-on purpose; I also gave him a Dram for himself,
but he would not taste it, but carried it to his Fa-
ther: I had in my Pocket also two or three Bunches
of my Raisins, so l gave him a Handful of the*
for his Father. He had no sooner given his Fa-
ther these Raisins, but I saw him come out of the
Boat,|and run away as if he had been bewitch'd;
:he run at such a rate; for he was the swiftest Fel-
low of his Foot that ever I saw; I say, he run at
such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were,
in an instant; and tho' I call'd and hollow'd too
after him, it was all one, away he went, and in a
.Quarter of an Hour, I saw him come back again,
tho' not so fast as he went; and as he came near-
er, I found his Pace was slacker, because he had
something in his Hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite Home for an Earthen Jugg, or Pot, to bring
his Father some fresh Water, and that he had got
two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread: The Bread
he gave me.but the Water he carried to his Father:,
However, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little
sup of it. This Water revived his Father more
than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him; for
he was just fainting with Thirst.
When
When his Father had drank, I catl'd to him to
know if there was any Water left; he said, Yes;
and I bad him give it to the poor Spaniard,
who was in as much Want of it as his Father;
and I sent one of the Cakes, that Friday brought,
to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak,
and was reposing himself upon a green Place, un-
der the Shade of a Tree, and whose Limbs were
also very stisf, and very much swell'd with the
rude Bandage he had been tied with. When I saw
that upon Friday's coming to him with the Water,
he sat up and drank, and took the Bread, and be-
gan to eat, I went to him, and gave him a handful
of Raisins; he look'd up in my Face with all the
Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulness that could
appear in any Countenance; but was so weak,
notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the
Fight, that he could not stand up upon his Feet;
he tried to do it two or three times, but was
really not able, his Ankles were so swell'd and so
painful to him ; so I bad him sit still, and caus'4
Friday to rub his Ankles, and bathe them with
Rum, as he had done his Father's.
1 oblerv'd the poor assectionate Creature every
two Minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he
was here, turn'd his Head abour, to see if his Fa-
ther was in the fame Place and Posture as he left
him sitting; and at last he found he was not to
be seen; at which he started up, and without
speaking a Word, slew with that Swiftness to him,
that one could scarce perceive his Feet to touch
the Ground as he went : But when he came, he
only found he had laid himself down to ease his
Limbs so Friday came back to me presently, and
I then spoke to the Spaniard to let &iday help
him up if he could, and lead him to the Boat, and
then he should carry him to our swelling, where
C1851
i would take cafe of him: But Friday, a lusty
strong Fellow, took the Spaniard quite tip upOri
his Back, and carry'd him away to the Boat, and
set him down softly upon the Side or Gunnel of
the Ganoe, with his Feet in the Inside of it, and
then lifted him quite in, and set him close to his
Father, and presently stepping out again, launch'd
the Boat osf, and paddled it along the Shore faster
than I could walk, tho' the Wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both sase inro our
Creek; and leaving them in the Boat, runs away
to setch the other Canoe. As he pass'd me, I
spoke to him, and ask'd him, whither he went;
he told me, Go setch more Boat; so away he went,
like the Wind; for sure never Man or Horse run
like him, and he had the other Canoe in the Creek,
almost as soon as I got to it by Land; so he
wafted me over, and then went to help our new
Guests out of the Boat, which he did; but they
were neither of them able to walk ; so that poor
Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my Thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the
Bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of
Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I
carry'd them up both together upon it between us:
But when we got them to the Outside of our Wall,
or Fortification, we were at a worse Loss than be-
fore; for it was impossible to get them over; and
I was resolv'd not to break it down: So I set to
Work again; and Friday and I,in about two Hours
Time, made a very handsome Tent, cover'd with
old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees,
being in the Space without our outward Fence,
and between that and the Grove of young Wood
which I had planted: And here we made them two"
Beds of such Things as Ihad,w*. of good Rice-
Straw,
Straw, with Blankets laid upon it to lie on, and
another to cover them on each Bed.
My Island was now peopled, and I thought my
self very rich in Subjects; and it was a merry Re-
slection which I frequently made, How like a King
I look'd. First of all, the whole Country was my
own meer Property; so that I had an undoubted
Right of Dominion, zdly, My People were per-
sectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and Law-
giver; they all ow'd their Lives to me, and were
ready to lay down their Lives, if there had been Oc-
casion of it, for me. It was remarkable too, we had
but three Subjects, and they were of three disserent
Religions. My Man Friday was a Protestant, his
Father was a Pagan and a Canibal, and the Spaniard
was a Papist: However, I allow'd Liberty of Con-
science throughout my Dominions: But this is by
the way.
As soon as I had secur'd my two weak rescued
Prisoners, and given them Shelter, and a Place to
rest them upon, I began to think of making some
Provision for them: And the first Thing I did, I
order'd Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt a
Kid and a Goat, out of my particular Flock, ro
be kill'd: When I cut osf the hinder Quarter, and
chopping it into small Pieces, I set Friday to Work,
to boiling and stewing, and made them a very
good Dish, I asl'ure you, of Flesh and Broth, ha-
ving put some Barley and Rice also into the
Broth; and as I cook'd it without Doors, for I
made no Fire within my inner Wall, so I carry'd
it all into the new Tent; and having set a Table
there for them, I sat down and eat my own Din-
ner'also with them, and, as well as I could, chear'd
them and encourag'dthem: Friday being my Inter-
preter, especially to his Father, and, indeed, to the
[**7l
Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the Language
of the Savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I order'd
Friday to take one of the Canoes, and go and
setch our Muskets and other Fire-Arms, which for
want of Time we had left upon the Place of Battle;
and the next Day I order'd him to go and bury
the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay open to
the Sun, and would presently be offensive; and I
also order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of
their barbarous Feast, which I knew were pretty
much, and which I could not think of doing my
self; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went
that Way: All which he punctually persorm'd, and
defac'd the very Appearance os the Savages being
there; so that when I went again, I could scarce
know where it was, otherwise than by the Corner
of the Wood pointing to the Place.
I then began to enter into a little Conversation
with my two new Subjects; and first I set Friday
to enquire of his Father, what he thought of the
Escape of the Savages in that Canoe, and whether
we might expect a Return of them with a Power
too great for us to resist: His first Opinion was,thac
thcSavages in the Boat never could live out the Storm
which blew that Night they went ofi; but must of
Necessity be drown'd or driven South to those other
Shores; where they were as sure to bedevour'das
they were to be drowned if they were cast away;
but as to what they would do if they came sase on
shore, he said he knew not; but it was his Opini-
on that they were so dreadfully frighted with the
manner of their being attack'd, the Noise and the
Fire, that he believ'd they would tell their People,
they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not
by the Hand of Man, and that the two which ap-
pear'd, (viz,.) Friday and me, were two Heavenly
'! - Sm'rire
Spirits of Furies come down to destroy them, and
not Men with Weapons: This he said he knew,
because he heard them all cry out so in their Lan-
guage to one another; f&r it was impossible to tsierii
to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and speak
Thunder, and kill at a Distance without lifting up
the Hand, as was done now: And this old Savage
was in the right; for, as I understood since by
other hands, the Savages never attempted to gd
over to the Island afterwards; they were so terri-
sied with the Accounts given by those four Men,
(for it seems they did escape the Sea) that they be-
liev'd whoever went to that enchanted Island would
be deslroy'd with Fire from the Gods.
This however I knew not, and therefore was
under continual Apprehensions for a good while,
and kept always upon my Guard, me and all my1
Army; for as we were now four of us, I would
have ventur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the
open Field at any time.
In a little time, however, no more Candes ap;
pearing, the Fear of their coming wore oss, and I
began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage
to the Main into Consideration, being likewise
assur'd by Friday's Father, that I might depend up-
on good Usage from their Nation on his Account,
if I would go.
But my Thoughts were a little suspended, when
1 had a serious Discourse with the Spaniard, and
when I understood that these were sixteen more
of his Countrymen and Portugese, who' having
been cast away, and made their Escape ro that
side, liv'd there at Peace indeed with the Sa-
vages, but were very sore put to it for Necessaries;
and indeed for Lise i I ask'd him all the Par-
ticulars of their Voyage, and found they were
* Spmist Ship, bound from *he Rit de la Plata,
JK> the Havana, being directed to leave their Load-
ing there, which was chiesly Hides and Siver, and
to bring back what European Goods they could
meet wich there; that they had fire Pmugnse Sea-
men on Board, whom they took out of another
Wreck; that five of their own Men were drown'd
when first the Ship was lost, and that these escaped
thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards, and arriv'd al-
most starv'd on the Canibal Coast, where they ex-,
pected to have been devour'd every Moment. '.'
He told me, they had some. Arms with them,
but they were perfectly useless, for that they had
neither Powder or Ball, the Washing of the Sea
having spoil'd all their Powder, but a little, which
they used at their first Landing to provide thenv-
selves some Food..'.'.'*
Iask'd him what he thought would become of
them there, and if they had fo'rm'd no Design of
making any Escape: He said, They had many
Consultations about it, but that. having neither
Vessel, nor Tools to build one, or Provisions of any
Kind, their Counsels always ended in Tears and
Despair. x'
I ask'd him how he thought they would receive;
a Proposal from me, which might tend towards an
Escape: And whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done? I told him with Freedom, I sear'4
mostly their Treachery and ill Usage of me, if I
put my Lite in their Hands; for that Gratitude was
no inherent Virtue ia the Nature of Man; nor
did Men always square theit Dealings by the Obli-
gations they had receiv'd, so much as they did
by the Advantages they expected. I told him, it
would be very hard, that I should be the Instrument
of their Deliverance, and that they mould after-
wards make me their Prisoner in New Spain, where
an Englijhman was certain to be made a Saeri-
Part. I TJ fice
E m}
sice, what Neoeffity, or what Accident soeye;,
brought him thither: And'that 1 had rather be de-
liver'd up to the Savages, and be devour'd alive,
than fall into the merciless Claws of the Priests,
and be carry'd into the Inquifition. I added, That
otherwise' I was perswaded, if they were all here,
'. we might, with so many Hands, build a Bark large
enough to carry us all away, either to the Brafis
Southwards ' dr to the Islands or Spanijh Coast
'Northward: But that if in Requital they should,
when I had put Weapons into their Hands, carry
me by Force among their own People, I might be
ill used for niy Kindness to them, and make my
Case worse .than it was before.-*". ',
He answered Wsth a great deal of Candor and
Ingenuity, That their Condition was. so miserable,
and they, were so sensible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the Thought of using any Man
unkindly that should contribute to their Delive-
ranee; and thatj if I pleased, he would go to them
with the old M4n, and discourse with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their Answer:
That he wdild make Condi tions with them upon
the r solemn Oath, That th.ey would be absolute-
ly under my; Leading, as their Commander and
Captain; and that they should swear upon the Ho-
ly Sacraments and Gospel, to be true to me, and
jto go to such Christian Country as that I should
agreee to, and no other; and to be directed whol-
ly and absolutely by my Orders, till they were
landed safely in such Country as I intended; and
phat he Would bring a Contract from them under
their Hands for that Purpose.'''
'Then be fold me, he would first swear to me
himself, (That he would never stir from me as long
as btflsvd,' till I gave h,m Orders; and that he
would take my Side to the last Drop of his Blood,
if there should happen the least Breach os Faith'
among his Countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil
honest Men, and they were under the greatest Di-
stress imaginable, having neither Weapons or
Clothes, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Di-
scretion of the! Savages , out of all Hopes of ever
returning to their own Country; and that he was
fare, if I would undertake their Relief, they wou'd
live and die by me. '. > ,.r;
Upon these Assurances, I resolv'd to venture to
relieve them, if possible, and to send the oW Sa-
vage and this Spaniard over to them to treat: But
when he had gotten all Things in a Readiness to
go, the Spaniard himself started art Objection,
which had so much Prudence in it on one Hand,
and so much Sincerity on the other Hand,: that I
could not but be very well satisfy'd in it; and, by
his Advice, put off the Deliverance of his Com-
rades for at least half a Year. The Case was thus:
He had been with us now about a Month; du-
ring which Time I had let him see in what Man-
ner! had provided, with thd Assistance of Provi-
dence, for my Support; and he saw evidently
wha't Stock of Corn and Rice I had laid up; which,
as it was more than sufficient for my self, so it was
not sufficient, at least without good Husbandry,
for my Family, now it Was encreas'dto Numbec
sour: But much less wduld it be sufficient, if his
Countrymen, who were, as he*said, fourteen still
alive, should come over; and least of all would
it be sufficient to victual our Vessel;, if we should
build one, for a Voyage to any of the Christian
Colonies of America. So he told me, 'he thought
it would be more advisable, to let him and the
two other dig and cultivate some more Land, as
much as I could spare Seed to sow- f and thaegwe
U 2 donld
rr*»:r j
CibiM'wwt another Harvest, that we migh t have ,
a Supply ot Corn sor his Country-men when they
should come ;- tor Want might be a Temptation to
them to disagree, or not to think themselves deli-
ver'd, otherwise than out of one Difficulty into
another. You know, fays he, the Children oUs*
rath .though they rejoie'd at first for their being
dwive r-'d out of Egypt, yet rebell'd even acainst
God himself that, deliver'd them, when they came
to want Bread in the Wilderness.
His Caution was so seasonable, and his Advice
so good, that I could not but be very well plcas'd
wi.h his Proposal, as Ayest as I was satisfy'd with
his Fidelity. So we sell to digging all four of us,
as well as; nhe wooden Tools we were furnished
with permitted; and in about a Month's Time, by
the End of which it was Seed-time, we had gotten
as much J-and cur'd and trimm'd up, as we sow'd
22 BushelsiOf Barley on, and 16 J^arrs of Rice,
which was* in short, a>l the Seed we had to spares
nor indeed ,did we leave our selves Barley sufficient
for our own Food, for the six Months that we had
to expect pur Crop, that is to fay, reckoning from
the Time- we set our Seed aside for sowing». &r it
is not to be fuppos'd it is six Months in the C-round
'in the Country. m-, -,
Having npw Society enough, and our Number
being sufficient to put us out of Fear of the Savages
if they bad come,, unless their Number had been
very great* we went freely all over the Island,
where-ever we found Occasion; and as here we had
our Escape or Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it
was impossible, at least fer me, to have the
Means of >'c put of mine. ^ to this Purpose, I
mark'd out.several Trees, which I thought sit for
our Work, and I set Friday and his Father to cut-
ting thestj dowu; and then i caus'd the Spaniard
'to whom 1 imparted my Thought on that Atfair,
to oversee and direct their Work. I mew*d them
with what indefatigable Pains I had hcw'da large
Tree into fingle Planks, and I caus'd them to do
the like, till they had made about a Dozen large
Planks of good Oak, near two Foot broad, 3 5; Foot
long, and from two Inches te-four Inches thick.:
'What prodigious Labour it took up, any one may
imagine. - ».
. At the-fame Time I contriv'd to encrease my lit-
tle Flock of tame Goats as much as I could; arid
.to this-Purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go
out one Day, and my self, with Friday, the next
Day; tor we took our Turns: And by this Means
we got about 20 young Kids to breed up with the
.rest; for when-ever we shot the Dam, we Jfav'd
theKids, and added them to our Flock: BkA above
all, the Season for curing the Grapes coming on,
lcaus'd such a prodigious-Quantity to be hungup
in the Sun, that I believe, had we been at Al'.cam,
where the Raisins of the Sun are cured, we could
-have-silled 60 -or 80 Barrels ; and these, with our
Bread* was a great Part of our Food, and very
good Living too, I assure you; for it is an ex-
ceeding nourishing Food.
It was now Harvest, and our Crop in good Or-
<ler it was not the most plentiful Encrease I had
seen in the Island, but however it was enough to
answer our End ; for from our 12 Bushels of Bar-
ley, we brought in and threshed out above 220
Bushels; and the like in Proportion of the Rice,
which was Score enough for our Food to the neic
Harvest, tho' all the 16 Spaniards had been on Shore
with me; or if we had been read) lor a Voyage, 4
it would very plentifully have victuall'd our -Ship,'
to havecarry'd us to any Part-of the World,'that
is to fay, of America.
When we had thus hous'd and secur'd our Ma-
gazine of Corn, we sell to Work to make more
Wicker Work, vix.. Great Baskets in which we
kept itand the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this Fart, and often blam'd me that
I did not make some Things for Desence, of this
Kind of Work; but I saw no Need of it.
And now having a full Supply of Food for all
the Guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard Leave
to go over to the Main, to see what he could do
with those he had left behind him there. I gave
him a strict Charge in Writing, not to bring any
Man with him, who would not first swear in the
Presence of himself and of the o!d Savage, That
he would no Way injure, fight with, or attack the
Person he would find in the Island, who was so
kind to send for them in Order to their Delive-
rance; but that they would stand by and defend
him against all such Attempts, and where-evcr
they went, would be entirely under, and subjected
to his Command; and that this should be put in
Writing, and sign'd with their Hands: How we
were to have this done, when I knew they had
neither Pen or Ink, that, indeed, was a Question
which we never asked. -
Under these Instruction;;, the Spaniard, and the
old Savage (the Father of Friday) went away in one
of the Canoes, which they might be said to come
in, or rather were brought in. when they came as
Prisoners to be devour'd by the Savages.
I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock
on it, and about eight Chargesof Powder and
Ball, charging them to be very good Husbands of
both, and not to use either of them but upon ur-
gent Occasion.
This was a chearful Work, being the first Mea-
sures used by me in View of my Deliverance for
. now
Lm ]
their Country-men for about eight'-fJaystime; and
wishing them a good Voyage; I see them gr/, a-
greeing with them- about a Signal they should hang
out at their Return*,.by which I.stsoWd'know.themi
again, when they tame back, at ^Distance, before
they came onSh'ore. ' ^V'f*
They went away with a fair Gife on the Day
.that the Moon wa$ at. Full by my'Xccount in thp
Month of OEloders but as for an exact Reckoning
of Days, after I had once lost it, I . fcbuld never re-
cover it again; nor had I kept even'tHc Number of
Years so punctually; as to be Art? that I was right,
tho'.as it prov'd, when Iafterwards e'xamin'dmy Ac-
count, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Years.
It was no less1 than eight Days lhad waited- for
tbem, when a strange and unforeseen Accident'iii-
terven'd, of which the like has' not,' perhaps, been
heard of in History. I was fast asleep in my Hutch
one Morning, when my Man Friday came running
in to me, and call'd aloud, Master; Master, they
are come, they are come. i 'J*S« '-i-.;
I jump'd up, and, regardless of Danger, I went
out as as soori as could get my Clothes on, thro'
my little Grove, which ( by the Way ) was by this
Time grown to be a Very thick Wood: I fay, re-
gardless of Danger, I went without my Arms,
which was not my Custom to do; but I was sur-
prized, when turniri'g my Eyes to the Sea, I pre-
sently saw a Boat at aboat a League and Half's Di-
stance, standing in for the Shore, with a Shoulder of
Mutton Sail, as, they call it, and the Wind blow-
ing pfetty fair to'bring them in: Also 1 observ'd
presently, that they did not come from that Side'
which the Shore lay on, but from' the Southed
U 4 moi?
t J
most End os the Island: Upon this I call'd Friday
in, and bid him lye close, for these were not the
People we look'd for, and that we might not know
yet whether they were Friends or Enemies.
In the next Place, I went in to setch my Per-
spective Glass, to see what I could make of them;
and having taken the Ladder out, I climb'd up to
the Top of the Hill, as I used to do when I was
apprehensive of any Thing, and to take my View
the plainer without being difeover'd.
I had scarce set my Foot on the Hill, when my
Eye plainly difeover'd a Ship lying at an Anchor,
at about two Leagues and an half's Distance from
'mt South-south-east, but not above a League and
an half from the Shore. By my Observation it ap-
pear'd plainly to be an Englifi Ship, and the Boat
appear'd to be an English Long-Boat.
I cannot express the Confusion I was in, tho' the
Joy of seeing a Ship, and one whom I had Reason to
believe was Mann'd by my own Conntry-men,and
consequently Friends, was such as I cannot de-
scribe; but yet I had some secret Doubts hung a-
bout me, I cannot tell from whence they came»
bidding me keep upon my Guard. In the first
Place, it occurr'd to me, to consider what Business
wJLnglist} Ship could have in that Parr of the World,
since it was not the Way to, or from any Part of the
World, where the Eug/ifij had any Traffick; and I
knew there had been no Storms to drive them m
'there, as in Distress; and that if they were £»<?"
Ijjh really, ir was most probable that they were
here upon no good Design; and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the Hands ot
Thieves and Murderers.
Let no Man despise the secret Hints and Notices
of Danger, which sometimes ate giveii him
when he may think there is no Possibility of its be-
ing
LEWjl
ing real. That such Hints and Notices arc given
us, I believe sew that have made any Observati-
ons of Things can deny; that they are certain Dis-
coveries of an invisible World, and a Converse of
Spirits, we cannot doubt; and is the Tendency
of them seems to be to warn us of Danger, why
should we not suppose they are from some friendly
Agent, (whether supreme, or inserior and subor-
dinate, is not the Question) and that they are gi-
ven for our Good? ..
The present Question abundantly confirms me
in the Justice of this Reasoning; for had I not
been made cautious by this secret Admonition,
come it from whence it will, I had been undone
inevitably, and in a far worse Condition than be-
fore, as you will see presently.
1 had not kept my self long in this Postufe, but
I saw the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they
lookM for a Creek to thrust in at for the Conveni-
ence of Landing; however, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not see the little Inlet
where I formerly landed my Rafts; but run their
Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about half a
Mile from me, which was very happy forme ; set
otherwise they would have landed just, as I may
fay, at my Door, and would soon have beaten me
out of my Castle, and, perhaps, have plunder'd me
of all I had.
When they were on Shore, I was fully satisfy'd
they were Englijb Men; at least most os them;
one or two I thought were Dutch; but it did not
prove fo: There were in all eleven Men, whereof
three of them I found were unarm'd, and, as I
thought, bound ; and when the first four or sive ot
them were jump'd on Shore, they took those three
out of the Boat as Prisoners: One of the three 1
could perceive using the most passionate Gestures ot
Entreats
Entreaty, Affliction and Despair, even to a kind of
Extravagance; the other two, I could perceives,
lifted up their Hands sometimes, and appear'd con-
cern'd indeed, but not tp such a Degree as the
first.
I was persectly confounded at the Sight, and
knew not what the Meaning of it should be. Fri-
day call'd out to me in Englijh, as well as he could,
0 Mister! Yott see English Mans eat Prisoner as -well
as Savage Mans. Why, says I, Friday,' do you
think they are a going to eat them then? Yes fays
Friday, "they vtilltatthm: No, no, fays T, Friday,
1 am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but
you may be sure they will not eat them.' .'
All this while I iiad no Thought of what the
Matter really was ; but stood trembling with the
Horror of the Sight, expecting evety Moment when
the three Prisoners should be kill'd; nay, once I saw
one of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cut-
lash i (as,the Seamen call it) or Sword, to strike one
ot the poor Men ; and I expected to see him fall
every Moment, at which a'l the Blood in my Body
leem'd to run chill in my Veins.
I wish'd heartily now for my Spaniard, and the
Savage that was gone with him; or that I had a-
ny Way to have come undiseover'd within Shot of
them, that I might have rescu'd the three Men i
for I saw no Fire-Arms they had among them, but
it sell out to my Mind another Way.
After I had observ'd the outrageous Usage of the
three Men by the insolent Seamen, I observ'd the
Fellows run scattering about the Land, as if they
wanted to see the Country: I observ'd that the
three other Men had Liberty to go also where they
pleas'd; but they fat down all thtee upon the?
Ground very pensive, and look'd like Men in
Despair.
This
I m 1
; This put me Mind of the first Timp when I
tame on Shore, and began to lo6k about me; how
I gave my felt' over for lost, how wildly I look'd
, found me, what dreadful Apprehensions 1 had, and
how I lodg'd in the Tree all Night for sear of be-
ing devour'd by wild Beasts.
.As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I
was to receive by the providential Driving of the
Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by
which I have since been so long nourish'd and sup-
ported; so these three poor desolate Men knew
nothing 'how certain of Deliverance and Supply
they were, how near it was to, them, and how ef-
fectually and really they were in a Condition of
Sasety, at the fame Time that they thought them-
selves lost, and their Case desperate.
So little do we see before us in the World, and
ib much Reason have we to depend chearfuily up-
on the great Maker of the World, that he does not
leave his Creatures so absolutely destitute, but that
in the worst Circumstances they have always some-
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are near-
er their Deliverance than they imagine; nay, are
even brought to their Deliverance by the Means
by which they seem to be brought to their Destru-
ction.
It was just at the Top of High-water when these
People came on Shore, and while partly they stood
parlying with the Prisoners they brought, and
partly while they rambled about to see what kind
of a Place they were in, they had carelessly staid till
the Tide was fpenr, and the Water was ebb'd con-
siderably away, leaving their Boat a-ground.
They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I
found afterwards, having drank a lictle too much
Brandy, sell a-sleep; however, one of them waking
sooner than the other, and rinding the Boat too sast
a-ground
a-ground for him to stir it, hallow'd for &ie rest
who were strangling about, upon which they
soon came to rhc Boat; but it was past altthek
Strength to launch her, the Boat being very heavy,
and the Shore on that side being a soft oozy Sand,
almost like a Quick-Sand. - TV-
iiuhis Condition, like trueSeamen, whoare,per-
hap«,the leastof all Mankind given to Fore-thought,
they gave it over, and away they stroll'd abaut the
Country again ; and I heard one of them fay aloud
to another, -(calling them off from the Boat) Why,
kt her done, Jack, can't ye, fliell float next 'fide; by
which I was fully confirm'd in the main Enquiry,
of what Countrymen they were? - '.' .
All this while I kept my self very close,not once
daring to stir out of my Castle, any farther than to
my Place of Observations, near the Top of the H ill,;
aixi very glad I was, to think how well it was for-
tify'd: I knew it was no less than ten Hours before
the Boat could be on sloat again, and by that
Time it would be dark, and I might be at more
Liberty to see their Motions, and to hear their
Discourse, if they had any.
In the mean Time I sitted my serf up for a Bat-
tle, as before; tho' with more Caution, knowing
I had to do with another kind of Enemy than I had
at sirst : I order d Friday also, whom I had made an
excellent Marksman with his Gun, to load him-
self with Arms : I took my self two Fowling-Pieces,
and I aive him three Muskets. My Figure, indeed,
was very fierce; I had my formidable Goat-skin
Coat on, with the great Cap I have mentioned, a
naked S < ord by my Side, two Pistols in my Belt,
and a Gun upon each Shoulder. *
It was my Design, as 1 said above, not to have
made any Attempt 'till it was dark: But about
two a Clock, being the Heat of the Day, I found
that
t 301 1
tharin short they were all gone straggHng into th«
Woods, and, as I thought, were laid down to Sleep.-.
Thethree poor distresltd Men, too anxious for their
Condition to get any Sleep, were, however, sec
dawn under the Shelter of a great Tree, at about
a quarter of a Mile from me, and, as I thought,
out of Sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resoiv'd to discover my self to them,
and learn something of their Condition : Immcdi- ,
ately I march'd in the Figure as above, my Man
Friday at a good Distance behind me, as formidable -
for his Arms as Ir but not making quite so star.ng,
a SfeEtre-like Figure as I did.
1 came as near themundiscoverrd as s could, and
then before any of them saw me, I call'd aloud to
them in Spanijh, H/hat are ye Gentlemen?
They flatted up at the Noise, but were ten
times more confounded when they saw me, and
the uncouth Figure that I made. They made do
Answer at all; but I thought I perceivd them just
going-to fly from me, vhen I spoke to them in
Englip: Gentlemen, said I, do not be surpriz'd at
me; perhaps you may have a Friend near yea
when you did not expect it. He must be. sent di-
rectly from Heaven then, said one ojthem iery
gravely to me, and pulling off his Hat at the fame "time'
to me, for our Condition is past the help of Man.
All Help is from Heaven, Sir, said I. But can
you put a Stranger in the Way how to help you,
for you seem to me to be in some great Distress?
I few you when you landed, and when you scem'd
to make Application to the Brutes that came with
you, I saw one of them lift up his Sword to kill
you.. , . *.
The poor Man, with Tears running down his
Face, and trembling, looking like one astonish'd,
return'd; Am 1 talking to God,, or Man I h it a real
(jo*]
Man, or an Angel! Be in no sear about that, Sir,
Jaid I} if God had sent an Anpel to relieve you, he
would have come betrer cloth'd, and arm'd after
another Manner than you see me in; pray lay aside
your Fears, I ama Man, an -Englijhman, and dis-
pos'd to assist you, you see; 1 have one Servant
only; we have Arms and Ammunition; tell us
freely, Can we serve you ?. What is your
Case?
Our Case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our Murders are so near; but, in short,
Sir, I was Commander of that Ship, my Men
have mutiny'd against me, they have been hardly
prevail'd on not to murder me, and at last
hare set me on Shore in this desolate Place, with
these two Men with me, one my Mate, the other
a Passenger,. where we expected to perish, believ-
ing the Place to be uninhabited, and know not yet
what to think of it.
Where are those Brutes, your Enemies, said I
Do you know where they arc gone? There they lye,
Sir, said he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees, my
Heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard
jdu speak; if they have, they -mil certainly murder us
all.
Have they any Fire-Arms, said I? He answer'd,
they had only two Pieces, and one which they
left in the Boat. Well then, said I, leave the rest
to me; I see they are all asleep, it is an easy thing
to kill them all; but shall we rather take them
Prisoners? He told me there was two despe-
rate Villains among them that it was scarce sase
to sliew any Mercy to; but if they were secur'd,
he believ'd al! the rest would return to their
Duty. I asked him, which they were? He
told me, he could net at that Distance describe
them ; but he would obey my Orders in any thing
I would
1 would.^irect. Well, says I, let us retreat out of
their View or Hearing, left they awake, and w/s
will resolve farther; so they willingly went back
with me, till the Woods cover'd us from them.
Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your
Deliverance, are you willing to make two Condi-
tions with me; he anticipated my Proposals, by
telling me, that both he and the Ship, if recover'd,
Ihould be wholly directed and commanded by me
in every thing; and if the Ship was not recover'd,
he would live and die with me in what Part of the
World soever I would send him; and the two o-
ther Men said the fame.
Well, fays I, my Conditions are but two. i. That
while you stay on this Island with me, you will not
pretend to any Authority here ; and if I put Arms
into your Hands, you will upon all Occasions give
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine,
upon this Island, and in the mean time be govern d
by my Orders. .si1.. .
2. That if the Ship is, or may be recover'd,
you will carry me and my Man to England Pas-
sage-free.
He gave me all the Assurances that the Invention
and Faith of Man could devise, that he would com-
ply with these most reasonable Demands, and be-
sides would owe his Lise to me, and acknowledge
it upon all. Occasions as Jong as he liv'd.
Well then, 5faid I, here are three Muskets'for
you, with Powder and Ball; tell me next what you
think is proper to be done. He shewed all the
Testimony of his Gratitude that he was able;
but offer'd to be wholly guided by me. I told him,
I thought it was hard venturing any Thing; but
the best Method ( could think of was. to sire upon
them at once, a., they lay; and if any was not
kill'd at the first Volley, and offered to submit,
we might save *hem, and so put it wholly upon
God's Providence to direct the Shot.
He said very modeltly, That he was loth to
kill them, if he could help it; but that those two
were incortigible Villains, and had been the Au-
thors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they
escaped, we mould be undone still; for they would
go on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Com-
pany, and destroy us all. Well then, said I, Ne-
cessity legitimates my Advice; fir it is the only
Way to save mir Lives, However, seeing him still
cautious of Ihedding Blood, I told him they should
go themselves, and manage as they found conve-
nient.: ...
In the Middle of this Discourse we heard some
of them awake, and soon arter we saw two of
them on their Feet: I ask'd him, if either of them
were the Men whom he had said were the Heads
or the Mutiny? He said, No: Well then, said I,
you may let them escape.and Providence seems to
have waken'd them on Purpose to save themselves.
Now, savs I, if the rest escape you, it is your
Fault.
Animated with this, he took the Musket I
had given him in his Hand, and a Pistol in
his Belt, and his two Comrades with him, with
each Man a Piece in his Hand. The two Men,
-who were with him going first, made some
Noise, at which one of the Seamen, who was
awake, turn'd about, and seeing them coming,
cry'd out to the rest, but it was too late then, for
the Moment he cry'd out, they sir'd; Imeanthetvx
JMen,the Captain wisely reserving his own Piece:
They had so well aim'd their Shot at the Men they
knew, that one of them was kill'd On the Spot, and
the other very much wounded ; but nor being dead,
he started up upon his* Feet, and call'd eagerly for
help to the other; but the Captain stepping to him;
told him, 'twas too late to cry for Help, he should
call upon God to forgive his Villainy.and with that
Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his
Musket; so that he never spoke more: There were
three more in the Company* and one of them was
also slightly wounded : By this time I was come;
and when they saw their Danger, and that it was
in vain to resist, they begg'dfor Mercy: The Capr
tarn told them, he would spare their Lives, if they
would give him any Assurance of their Abhorrence
of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and
would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the
Ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Ja-
maica, from whence they came: They gave him
all the Protestations of their Sincerity that could
be desir'd, and he was willing to believe them, and
spare their Lives, which I was not against; onlyfll
oblig'd him to keep them bound Hand and Foot
while they were upon the Island. ,
While, this was doing, I sent Friday with the
Captain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to secure
her, and bring away theOars and Sail, which they
did ; and by and by, three ftragling Men that
were (happily for them) parted from the reft, came
back upon hearing the Guns fir'd, and seeing their
Captain, who before was their Prisoner, now their
Conqueror, they submitted to be bound also, and
so our Victory was compleat.
It now remain'd, that the Captain and I should
enquire into one another's Circumstances: I began
first, and told him my whole History, which he
heard with an Attention even to Amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful Manner of my being
furnisli'd with Provisions and Ammunition; and
indeed, as my Story is a whole Collection of Won-
ders, it afiected him deeply; but when he reflected
Part h X from
from thence upon himself, and how I seem'd to .
have been preserv'd there on purpose to save his
Lise, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could
not speak a Word more.
After this Communication was at an End, I car-
ry'd him and his two Men into my Apartment,
leading them in just where I came out, via. at the
Top of the House, where I refresti'd them with
such Provisions as I had, and shew'd them all the
Contrivances I had made, during my long, long,
inhabiting that Place.
All I (hew'd them, all I said to them, was per-
sectly amazing; but above all, the Captain admir'd
my Fortification, and how persectly 1 hadconceal'd
my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having
been now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees
growing much faster than in England, was become
^little Wood, and so thick, that it was unpayable
in any Part of it, but at that one Side, where I
had reserv'd my little winding Paslage into ir, I
told him, this was my Castle and my Residence;
but that I had a Seat in the Country, as most Prin-
ces have, whither I could retreat upon Occasion,
and I would shew him that too another Time;
but at present our Business was to consider how to
recover the Ship: He agreed with me as to that!
but told me, he was persectly at a Loss what Mea-1
sures to take; for that there were slil l six and twen-
ty Hands on Board, who having enter'd into a
cursed Conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited
their Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it
now by Desperation; and would carry it on, know-
ing that if they were redue'd, they should be
brought to the Gallows as soon as they came to
England, or to any of the Englijh Colonies; and
that therefore there would be no attacking them
with so small a Number as we were.
I mused
I mused for some time upon what he had said,
and found it was a very rational Conclusion; and
that therefore something was to be resolved on ve-
ry speedily, as well to draw the Men on Board in-
to some Snare for their Surprize, as to prevent their
Landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this it
presently occurr'd to me, that in a little while, the
Ship's Crew wondering what was become of their
Comrades and of the Boat, would certainly come
on Shore in their other Boat, to see for them, and
that then perhaps they might come arm'd, and be
too strong for us: This he allow'd was rational.
Upon this I told him, the first Thing we had to
do, was to stave the Boar, which lay upon the
Beach, so that they might not carry her osf; and
taking every thing out of her, leave her so far use-
less as not to be fit to swim; accordingly we went
on Board, took the Arms which were left on Board,
out of her, and whatever else we found there,
which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of
Rum, a sew Bisket-Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and
a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas; the
Sugar was five or six Pounds; all which was
very welcome to me, especially the Brandy and
Sugar, of which I had had none lest for many
Years.
When we had carry'd all these Things on Shere,
(the Oars, Mast, Sail, and Rudder of rhe Boat,
Were carry'd away before, as above) we knock'd a
great Ho!e in her Bottom, that if they had come
strong enough to master us, yet they could not
carry off the Boat.
Indeed it was not much in my Thoughts, that
we could be able to recover the Ship; but my View
was, that if they went away without the Boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again, to carry us
away to the Leeward J/lands, and call upon onr
X 2 Friends
Friends- the Spaniards, in my Way, for I had them
Still in my Thoughts.
:., WWe we were thus preparing our Designs, and
had first, by main Strength, heaved the Boat up
upon the Beach, so high that the Tide would not
. fleet her off at High.-Water-Markand, besides,
.tadbroke a Ho^e in her Bottom, too big to be
quickly stopp'd, and. were fat down musing what
we should do, we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and
lftwter malsea waft .with her Antient, as a Sig-
vrjaj.for tfye Boat tp come, on Board ; but no Boat
stirr a ; .and they .fir'd several.times, making other
Signals for the Bpa^,, ,
i.;-/^,M,^Keja'^ll/their Signals and Firings prov'd
-fruitless, and they found the Boat did not stir, we
&w them, by the Help of my Glasses, hoist ano-
ther-Boat out, and row towards the Shore; and
,-we found, as they approached, that there was no
r |es>. phan ten Men in her, and that they had Fire-
i'Aagf.mda them., ,.„ ,' '''''
i . As the' Ship lay almost two Leagues from the
r Shoreg we had a Mi View of them as they came,
,aud japlain Sight of the Men, even of their Faces,
. becauic the Tide having set them a little to the
- ifc?y2 of the other Boat, they rowed up under Shore,
to come to the same Place, where the other had
landed, and where the Boat lay.:
[il'W Means,} fay,we had a full View of them,
^and the Captain knew the Persons and Chara-
cters of all the Men in the Boat; of whom he said,
-that there were three very honest Fellows, who
he was sure were led into this Conspiracy by the
- rest, being over-powered and frighted.
,,. But that as'for the Boatswain, who it seems was
'the chief Osficer among them, and all the rest, they
"were as outrageous as any of the Ship's Crew, and
-were, no doubt, made desperate in their new Enter-
prize'i
prize; and terribly apprehensive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
Isinil'dat him, and told him, that Men in our
Circumstances were past the Operations of Fear's
That seeing almost every Condition that could be
was better than that which we were suppos'd to-be
in, we ought to expect that the Consequence, whe-
ther Death or Lise, would be sure to be a Delive-
rance. I asked himwhac he thought of the Cir-
cumstances of my Lise? And, whether a Delive-
rance were not worth venturing for? And where,
Sir, said I, is your Belief of my being preserv'd here
on Purpose rb save your Life, which elevated you
alittle While ago? For my Part, said I, there seems
to be but one Thing amiss in all the Prospect of it:
What's that? says he; why, said I, 'Tis that, as you
fay, there arc three or four honest Fellows among
them, which should bespar'd; had they been all of
the wicked Part of the Grew, I should have thought
God's Providence had singled them out to deliver
them into your Hands; for depend upon iv, every
Man of them that comes a-shorc are our own, and
shall die or live, as they behave to us. '.srfs
As I spoke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful
Countenance, I found it greatly encourag'd him, so
we set vigorously to our Business: We had, upon
the first Appearance of the Boat's coming from the
Ship, consider'd of separating our Prisoners, and
had indeed secur'd them efsectually. '>>>>.. '- '.'J
Two of them, of whom the Captain was less af-
fur'd than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of
the three (delivered Men) to my Cave, Where they
were remote enough, and out of Danger of being
heard or discover'*!, or of finding their Way out of
the Woods, if they could have delivered themselves.
Here they left themty>Und, but gave them Provisi-
ons, and promised them if they continued there
X 3 quietly
tJ»o]
quietly, to give them their Liberty in a Day or
two; but that if they attempted their Escape, they
should be put to Death without Mercy. They pra-
mis'd faithfully to bear their Confinement with
Patience, and were very thankful that they had
such good Usage as to have Provisions, and a Light
left them ; for Friday gave them Candies (such as
we made ourselves) for their Comfort; and they
did not know but that he. stood Centinel over
them at the Entrance.
The other Prisoners had better Usage; two of
them were kept pinion'd indeed, because the Cap-
tain was not tree to trust them, but the other two
were taken into my Service upon their Captain s
Recommendation, and upon their solemnly enga-
ging to live and die with us; so, with them and the
three honest Men, we were seven Men well arm'd;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well
enough with the Ten that were a coming, consi-
dering that the Captain had said, there were three
or four honest Men among them also.
As soon as they got to the Place where their Q*
ther Boat lay, they run their Boat into the Beach,
and came all on Shore, hauling the Boat up after
them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid
they would rather have left the Boat at an An-
chor, some Distance from the Shore, with some
Hands in her to guards her; and so we should nos
be able to seize the Boat.
Being on Shore, the first Thing they did, they
ran all to the other Boar, and it was easy tp see
that they were under a great Surprize, ro fipd her
slripp'd as above, of all that was in her, and *
great Hole in her Bottom.
After they had mus'd a while upon fhis, they
set up two or three great Shouts, hollowing with
all their Might, to try if they could make their
Companions
Companions hear; but all was to no Purpose: Then
they came all close in a Ring, and sir'd a Volley of
their small Arms, which indeed we heard, and the
Echoes made the Woods ring; but it was all one,
those in the Cave we were fare could not hear, and
those in our Keeping, though they heard it well c-
nough, yet durst give no Answer to them.
They were so astonisti'd at the Surprize of this,
that as they told us afterwards, they resolv'd to go
all on Board again to their Ship, and let them know
there, that the Men were all mufder'd, and the
Long-Boat stav'd; accordingly they immediately
launch'd their Boat again, and got all of them on
Board.
The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even con-
founded ac this, believing they would go on Board
the Ship again, and set Sail, giving their Comrades
for lost, and so he should still lose the Ship, which
he was in Hopes we should have recover'd; but he
was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the Boat,
but we perceiv'd them all coming on Shore again;
but with this new Measure in their Conduct, which!
it seems they consulted together upon, viz,. To
leave three Men in the Boat, and the rest to go on
Shore, and go up iuto the Country to look for
their Fellows.
This was a great Disappointment to us; for now
we were at a Loss what to do; for our seizing
those scvp Men on Shore would be no Advantage
to us, if we let the Boat escape, because they would
then row away to the Ship, and then the rest of
them would be sure to weigh and set Sail, and so
our recovering the Ship would be lost.
However, we had no Remedy but to wait and
see what the Issue of Things might present: The
(even Men came on Shore, and the three who re-
X 4 . 1 - main'd
. .... C J11 H
main'd in the Boat, put her osf to a good Distance
from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait
for them; so that it was impossible for us to come
at them in the Boat.
• Those that came on Shore kept close together,
marching towards the Top of the little Hill, under
which my Habitation lay; and we could lee them
plainly, tho' they courd not perceive us: We
fould have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, so that we might have hYd at them,
or that they would have gone farther off, that we
might have come Abroad.
But when they were come to the Brow of the
Hill, where they could see a great Way into the
Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the North-
East Parr, and where the Island lay lowest, they
fliouted and hallow'd till they were weary; and
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the Shore,
nor far from one another, they fat down together
under a Tree, to consider of it: Had.they thought
fit to have gone to sleep there as the other Party
of them bad done, they had done the Job for us;
Ibut they were too full of Apprehensions of Danger,
to venture to go to sleep, tho' they could not tell
what the Danger was they had to sear neither.
The Captain made a very just Proposal to me,
upon this Consultation of theirs, viz,. That per?
haps they would ail fire a Volley again, to endea-
vour to make their Fellows hear, and that we
should all sally upon them, just at the Juncture
when their Pieces were all discharg'd, and they
would cerrainly yield, and we should have them
without Blood-shed: I lik'd the Proposal, provided
it was done while we were near enough to como
iip to them, before they could load the« Picces:
again.
But this Event did not happen, and we lay still
a long Time, very irresolute what Course to take;
at length I told them, there would be nothing to
be done in my Opinion till Night; and then if
they did not return to the Boat, perhaps we might
find a Way to get between them and the Shore,
and so might use some Stratagem with them in
the Boat, to get them on Shore,
i We waited a great While, tho' very impatient
for their Removing, and were very uneasy; when,
after long Consultations, we saw them start all up?
and march down towards the Sea: It seems they
had such dreadful Apprehensions upon them, of
the Danger of the Place, that they resolv'd to gq
on Board the Ship again, give their Companions
over for lost, and so go on with their intended
Voyage with the Ship.
As soon as I perceiv'd them go towards tire Shore,
I imagin'd it to be as it really was, That they had
given over their Search, and were for going back
again; and the Captain, as soon as I told him my
Thoughts, was ready to sink at the Apprehensi-
ons os it, but I presently thought of a Stratagem to
setch them back again, and which answer'd my
End to a Tittle.
I order'd Friday and the Captain's Mate, to go
over the little Cteek Westward, towards the Place
where the Savages ame on Shore, when Friday was
rescu'd; and as soon as they came to a little rising
Ground, at about half a Mile's Distance, I bad them
hallow as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the Seamen heard them, that as soon as ever
they heard the Seamen answer them, they should
return it again, and then keeping out of Sight, take
a Round, always answering when t'other hallow'd,
to draw them as far into the Island, and among the
Wood»,
Woods as possible, and then wheel about again to
me, by such Ways as I directed them.
They were just going into the Boat, when i-W-
day and the Mate follow'd, and they presently heard
them, and aniwering, run along the Shore Well-
ward, towards the Voice they heard, when they
were presently stopp'd by the Creek, where the
Water being up, they could not get over, an4
eall'd for rhe Boat to come up, and set them over,
as indeed I expected,
When they had set themselves over, I obscrv'd,
that the Boat being gone up a good Way intp the
Creek, and, as it were, in a Harbour within the ,
]Land, they took one of the three Men out os her
to go along with them, and left only two in the
Boat,, having faslen'd her to the Stump of a little
Tree on the Shore.
This was what I wish'd for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the Captain's Mate ro their Bu-
siness, I took the rest with me, and crossing the
Creek out of their Sight, we surpriz'd the two
Men before they were aware, one of rhem lying
on Shore, and the other being in the Boat; the
Fellow on Shore was between sleeping and waking,
and going to start up, the Captain, who was fore-
most, ran in upon him, and knock d him down, and
then call'd out to him in the Boat to yield, or he
Was a dead Man.
There needed very sew Arguments to perswade
a single Man to yield, when he saw five Men uP°.n
him, and his Comrade knock'd down; besides, this
was, it seems, one of the three who were not so hear-
ty in the Mutiny as the rest of the Crew, and there-
fore was easily perswaded, not only to yield, but
afterwards to join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the Captain's Mate
so well manag'd their Business with the rest, that
they drew them, by Hollowing and Answering
from one Hill to another, and from one Wood to
another, till they not only heartily tir'd them, but
left them where they were very sure they could
not reach back to the Boat before it was dark;
and indeed they were heartily tir'd themselves air
so by the Time they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch sot
them in the Dark, and to fall upon them, so as to
make sure Work with them.
It was several Hours after Friday ame back to
me, before they came back to their Boat, and we
could hear the foremost of them long before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along, and could also hear them answer, and com-
plain how lame and tir'd they were, and not able
to come any faster, which was very welcome
News to us.
At length they came up to the Boat; but'tis
impossible to express their Confusion, when they
found the Boat fast a-ground in the Creek, the
Tide ebb'd out, and their two Men gone, we
could hear them call to one another in a most la-
mentable Manner, teilipg one another they were
gotten into an inchanted Island; that either there
were Inhabitants in it, and they should all be mur^
der'd;orelse there were Devils or Spirits in it, and
they should be all carry'd away and devour'd.
They hollow'd again, and call'd their two
Comrades by their Names a great many Times,
but no Answer. After some Time, we could see
them, by the little Light there was, run about
wringing theit Hands, like Men in Despair; and
that sometimes they would go and sit down in the
Boat to rest themselves, then come a-shbre again,
and walk about, again, and so the fame Thing
pyer agajn/
My Men would fain have me give them Leave
to falJ upon them at once in the Dark; but I was
willing to take them at some Advantage, so to
spare them, and kill as sew of them as I could;
and especially I was unwilling to hazard the kil-
ling any of our Men, knowing the other were
very well armed. I resolved to wait to see it they
did not separate; and therefore to make sure os
them, I drew my Ambuscade nearer, and ordered
friday and the Captain to creep upon their Hands
and Feet as close to the Ground as they could,
that they might not bediscoveredi and get as near
them as they could possibly, before they ofter'd to
tire. . .- ".'
They had not been long in that Posture,' but
that the Boatswain, who was the principal Ring-
leader or the Mutiny, and had now shewn himself
the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest,
came walking towards them with two more or
their Crew; the Captain was so eager, as having
this principal Rogue so much in his Power, that
he could hardly have Patience to let him come so
near as to be sure of him; for they only heard his
Tongue before: But when they came nearer, the
Captain and Friday starting up on their Feet, let
sty at them.
. The Boatswain was kilPd upon the Spot; the
next Man was shot into the Body, and sell just by
him, tho' he did not die till an Hour or two after/
and the third run for it - .' '';
. At the Noise of the Fire, I immediately ad-
vane'd with my whole Army, which was now
eight Men, viz,. my self Generalissimo, Friday my
Lieutenant-General, rhe Captain and his two Men.
andthe three Prisoners of War, whom wq had tru-
sted.with. Arms. .....
We
[ Ji7l
i We came upon them indeed in the Dark, so that
they could not see our Number, and I made the
Man they had left in the Boat, who was now orfc
of us, to call them by Name, to try if I could-
bring them to a £ar!cy, and so might perhaps re-
duce them to Terms, which sell out just as we de-
sir'd: For indeed it was easy to think, as their
Condition then was, they would be very willing
to capitulate .i. so he calls out as loud as he could,
to one of them, torn Smith, %tk Smith; Tom Smith
answer'd immediately, Who's that, Robinson? For
it seems he knew his Voice : T'other answer'd, Ay,
ay, for God's fake, Tom Smith, throw down your
Arms, and yield, or you are all dead Men this Mo*
merit.
Who must vx yield'to?Where are they? (says Smith
again;) Here they are', fays he, here's our Captain,
and fifty Men with him, have been hunting you
this two Hours ; the Boatswain is kill'd, WtUfrye
is wounded, and I am a Prisoner; and if yon do
not yield, you are all lost. ,v „'":
Will they give us Quarter then, (fays Tom Smith)
and we will yield? I'll go aud ask, if you promise to,
yields fays Robinson; so he asked the Captain, and
the Captain himself then calls out, You Smith, you
know my Voice, if you lay down your Arms im-
mediately, and submit, you shall have your Lives,
all but WM. Atkins.
Upon this, Will Atkins cry'd out, For Cod's fake,
Captain, giiie me Quarter, What home 1 done I They
have been all as bad as I; which by the Way was not
true neither; for it seems this WM. Atkins was the
first Man that laid Hold of the Captain, when they
first mutiny'd, and used him barbarously, in tying
his Hands, and giving him injurious Language.
However, the Captain told him he must lay down
his Arms at Discretion, and trust to the Gover-
nour's
Hour's Mercy, by which he meant me; for they
all call'd me Governour.
In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and
begg'd their Lives; and I sent the Man that had
parley'd with them, and two more, who bound
them all; and then my great Army of 50 Men,
which particularly with thole three, were all but
eight, came up and seir'd upon them all, and up-
on their Boat, only that I kept my self and one
more out of Sight, for Reasons of State.
Dur next Work was to repair the Boat, and to
think of seizing the Ship; and as for the Captain,
now he had Leisure to parley with them, he expo1
slulated with them upon the Villainy of their Pra-
ctices with him, and at length, upon the farther
Wickedness of their Design, and how certainly it
must bring them to Misery and Distress in the
End, and perhaps to the Gallows.
They all appeat'd very penitent, and begg'd hard
for their Lives: As for that, he told them they
were none of his Prisoners, but the Commander's of
the Island; that they thought they had set him on
Shore in a barren uninhabited Island, but it had
pleas'd God so to direct them, that the Island
.was inhabited, and that the Governour was an
Englijb Man; that he might hang them all there, if
he pleas'd; but as he had given them all Quarter,
heiuppos'd he would send them to England^ to be
dealt with there, as Justice requir'd, except At-
kins, who was commanded by the Governour to
advise to prepare for Death; for that he would be
hang'd in the Morning.
Though this was all a Fiction of his own, yet
it had its desired Efsect; Atkins sell upon.his Knees
to beg the Captain to intercede with the Gover-
nour for his Lise, and all the rest begg'd of him
sot
for God's fake, that they might not be sent to
England. t
It now occurr'd to him, that the Time of our
Deliverance was come, and that it would be a most
easy Thing to bring these Fellows in, to be hearty
•i getting Possession of the Ship; so I retir'd in the
Dark from them, that they might not see what
Kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the Cap-
tain to me; when I call'd, as at a good Distance,
one of the Men was order'd to speak again, and fay
to the Captain, Captain, the Commander calls jor
you; and presently the Captain reply'd, 7eS his
Excellency, I am juft a coming: This more persectly
amus'd them; and they all believ'd that the Com-
mander was just by with his fitly Men.
Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told bim
my Project for seizing the Ship, which he lik'd of
wonderfully well, and resolv'd to put it in Execu-
tion the next Morning.
But in Order to execute it with more Art, and to
be secure of Success, I told him we must divide the
Prisoners, and that he mould go and take Atkins
and two more of the worst of them, and send
them pinion'd to the Cave where the others lay:
This was committed to F, iday and the two Meft
who came on Shore with the Captain.
They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Pri-
son; and it was, indeed,-a dismal Place, especial-
ly to Men in their Condition.
The other I order'd to my Bower, as I call'd it,
of which I have given a full Description; and as
it was sene'd in, and they pinion'd, the Place was
secure enough, considering they were upon their
Behaviour.
To these in the Morning I sent the Captain, who
was to enter into a Parley with them, in a Word,
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they
might
Wight be trusted or no, to go on Board and sur-
prize the Ship. He talk'd to them of the Injury
done him, of the Condition they were brought to;
and that though the Governour had given them
Quarter for their Lives, as to their present Action,
yet that if they were sent to England, they would
all be hang'd in Chains, to be sure; but that is
they would join in such an Attempt, as to recover
the Ship, he would have the Governour's En-
gagement for their Pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a Propo-
sal may be accepted by Men in their Condition;
they fell down osi their Knees to the Captain, and
promised with the deepest Imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last Drop, and
that they should owe their Lives to him, and
would go with him all over the World; that they
would own him for a Father to them as long as
they liv'd.
Well, fays the Captain, I must go and tell the
Governour what you fay, and see what I can do
to bring him to consent to it: So he brought me
an - Account of the Temper he found them in;
and that he verily believed they would be faith-
ful. . .; .' ..
However* that we might be very secure, I told
him he should go back again, and chuse out those
five, and tell them, they might see that he did not
want Men ; that he would take out those five to
be his Assistants, and that the Governour will keep
the other two, and the three that were sent Priso-r
ners to the Castle (my Cave) as Hostages, for the
Fidelity of those five; and that if they prov'd un-
faithful in the Exeution, the five Hostages should
be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore.
this
This look'd severe, andconvine'd them that the
Governour was in Earnest; however, they had no
Way left them but to accept it; and it was now
the Business of the Prisoners, as much as of the
Captain, to perswade the other five to do theic
Duty.
Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Ex-
pedition, i. The Captain, his Mate, and Passenger,
a. Then the two Prisoners of the first Gang, to
whom, having their Characters from the Captain,
I had given their Liberty, and trusted them with
Arms. j. The other two, whom I had kept till now
in my Bower pinion'd, but, upon the Captain's
Motion, had now releas'd. 4. These five releas'd
at last; so that they were twelve in all, besides
five we kept Prisoners in the Cave for Hostages.
I ask'd the Captain, If he was willing to ven-
ture with rhese Hands on board the Ship? For,
as for me and my Man Friday, I did not think
it was proper for us to stir, having seven Men
left behind; and it was Employment enough for
us to keep them asunder, and supply them with
Victuals.
As to the five in the Cave, I resolv'd to keep
them fast; but Friday went in twice a Day to them,
to supply them with Necessaries; and I made the
other two carry Provisions to a certain Distance,
where Friday was to take it.
When I shew'd my self to the two Hostages, it
was with the Captain, who told them, 1 was the
Person the Governour had order'd to look after
them, and that it was the Governour's Pleasure they
should not stir any where but by my Direction 5
that if they did, they should be setch'd into the
Castle, and be laid in Irons; so that as we ne-
ves suffer'd them to see me as Governour, so I
now appeat'd as another Person, and spoke of the
Part L I Govern-
Goverhour, the Garrison, the Castle, and the like,
upon all Occasions. ;.-. . - r; v.- .>, . '>
The Captain now had no Difficulty before him,
but to fnmish his two Boats, stop the Breach of
One, and Man them. He made his Passenger
Captain of one, with four other Men; andhiar ,
self, and his Mate, and five more, went in the or'
ther: And they contriv'd their BusirieCsvery well;
for they came up to the Ship about Midnight. As
soon as they came within Call of the Ship, he made
Rcbinfm hale them, aad tell them he had brought
MS the Men and the Boat, but that it was a long
Time before they had found them, and the like;
holding them in i Chat till they came to the Ship's
Side; when the Captain and the Mate, entering
first with their Arms, immediately knock'ddown
the Second Mate and Carpenter with the BuNnd
of their Muskets, being very faithfully secondffl
by their Men; they secur'd all the rest that were
upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began t»
fasten the Hatches to keep them down who were
below* when thr other Boat and their Men enter-
ing at the Fore-Chains, secur'd the Fore-Castle of
the Shipr and the Skcmle which went down into
eh* Cook-Room, making three Men they found
thei* Prisoners* . «s :/ c.:.-.: .- . -'
t When this was done, and all safe upon Deck, tb»
Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break
into the Round-House,where the hew RebelCap-
tainl*y, and, having taken the AJarnj, wasg«'
ten up, and with, two Men and a Boy had gottcti
Fire-Arms in thehr Hands; and when the Mate
with a Crow spMt open the. Door, the new Cap-
tain and his Men. fir'd boldly among them, and
wounded the Mate with a -Muskfit-iBall, which
fcroke his Arm, and wounded two mere o/theMes;
but kilt'd nobody,.:^:sti zy.*.:^ & i';Mffos
The Mate calling for Help, rush'd however in*
to the Round-Houie, wounded as he was, and
with his Pistol shot the new Captain through the
Head, the Bullet entering at his Mouth, and came
out again behind one of bis Ears; so that he ne-
ver spoke a Word; upon which the rest yielded*
and the Ship was taken esfectually, without any
more Lives lost. .
As soon as the Ship was thus sceur'd, the Cap-
tain order'd leven Guns to be fir'd, which was the
Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
of his Success, which you may be sore I was very
glad to hear, having fat watching upon the Shore
for it, till near two of the Clock in the Morning.
Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a Day of great Fatigue
to me, I slept very sound, till I was something fur-
priz'd with theNoise of & Gun; and presently
starting up, I heard a Man call me by the Name of
Goverhour, Governour, and presently I knew the
Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top of
the Hill, there he stood, and pointing to the Ship,
he embrae'd me in his Arms, My dear Friend Mid
Deliverer, fays he, there's your Ship, for jhe is all yours,
and so are we and all that belong to her. I cast my Eyes
to the Ship, and there she rode within little more
than halfa Milcof the Shore; for they hadweigh'd
her Anchor as soon as they were Masters of her;
and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an
Anchor just against the Mouth of the little Creek;
and the Tide being up, the Captain had brought
the Pinnace in near the Place where I first landed
my Rafts, and so landed just at my Door.
I was at first ready to sink down with the Sur-
prize: For I saw my Deliverance indeed1 visibly
put into my Hands, all Things easy, and a larg*
Ship'just ready to carry me away whither I plea-
Is a fed
sed to go. At first, for some Time, I was hot able
to answer him one Word; but as he had taken
me in his Arms, I held fast by him, ot I should
have fallen to the Ground.
He perceiv'd the Surprise, and immediately
pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a
Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on pur-
pose for me; after I drank it, I fat down up-
on the Ground; and though it brought me to my-
self, yet it wars a good while before I could speak
a Word to him.
All this while the poor Man was in as great an
Fxtasy as I, only not under any Surprize, as I was;
and he said a thousand kind tender Things to me,
to compose and bring me to myself; but such
was the Flood of Joy in my Breast, that it put all
my Spirits into Confusion; at last it broke out
into Tears, and in a little while after I recover'd
my Speech. .
Then I took my Turn, and embrae'd him as
my Deliverer; and we rej'oyc'd together. I told
him, I look'd upon him as a Man sent from Hea-
ven to deliver me, and that the whose Tranfanction
leem'd to be a Chain of Wonders; that such Things
as these were the Testimonies we had of a secret
Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could
search into the remotest Corner ef the World, and
send Help to the Miserable whenever he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankful-
ness to Heaven; and wh*t Heart could forbear to
bless him, who had not only in a miraculous Man-
ner provided for one in such a Wilderness, and
in such a desolate Condition, but from whom
ever Deliverance must always be acknowledged
to proceed!
f i»* i
When we had tailed a while, the Captain told
me, he had brought me some little Refreshmenr,
such as the Ship afforded, and such as the Wretches
that had been so long his Masters had not plun-
der'd him of: Upon this he call'd aloud to the
Boat, and bid his Men bring the Things a-shore
that were for the Governour; and indeed it was
a Present, as if I had been one not that was to be
carry'daway along with them, but as if! had been
to dwell upon the Island still, and they were to
go Without me-
First he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles full
of excellent Cordial Waters, six large Bottles of
Modern Wine; the Bottles held two Quarts ar
piece; two Pound of excellent good Tobacco,
twelve good Pieces of the Ship's Beef, and six Pie-
ces of Pork, with a Bag ofPease, and about a hunr
dred Weight of Bisket.
He brought me also a Box of Sugar, a Box of
Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles of
Lime-juice, and abundance of other Things: But
besides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new Shirts,
six very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of Gloves,
one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of Stock-
ings, and a very good Suit ©f Cloarhs of his own,
which had been worn but very little: In a Word,
he cloathed me from Head to Foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable Present, as any
one may imagine, to one'in my Circumstances:
But never was any thing in the World of that Kind
so unpleasant, awkard, and uneasy as it was to
me to wear such Qoaths at their first putting on.
After these Ceremonies past, and after all his
good Things were brought into my little Apart-
ment, we began to consult what was to be done
with the Prisoners we had ; for it was worth eonr
Y i sideritig
sidcring, whether we inight venture to take them
away with us or no, eipccially two of them, whom
we knew to incorrigible and refractory to the
last Degree; and the Captain laid, he knew they
were such Rogues, that there was no obliging
them, and if he did carry them away, it must be
in Irons, as Malefactors, to be deliver'd over to
Justice ac the first English Colony he could come
at; and I found that the Captain himself was very
anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that if he desir'd it, I
durst undertake to bring the two Men he spoke of,
to make it their own Request that he should leave
them upon the Island: /should be very glad of that,
fays the Captain, -with all tny Heart.
. Well, fays I, I will send for them up, and talk
with them for you: So Icaus'd Friday and the two
Hostages, for they were now diseharg'd, their
Comrades having perform'd their Promise: I fay, I
caused them to go to the Cave, and bring up the
five Men, pinion d as they were, to the Bo weft and
keep them there till I came. .'.-
After some Time, J came thither dress'd in roy
new Habit,andnow l wascall'd Govtrnpuragain}
being all met, and the Captain with me, I caus'd
the Men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had. a full Account of their villainous Beha-
viour to the Captain, and how they had run away
with the Ship, and were preparing to commit far-
ther Robberies, but that Providence had en-
snar'd them in their own Ways, and that they
were fallen into the Pit which they had digg'd for
others. , - <
I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship
had been /eiz'd, that she lay now in the Road, and
they might see by and by, that their new Captain
hid
t 5*7 3
foad receiv'd the Reward of his Villainy j for that
{hey might see him hanging at the Yard-Arm. i
That as to them, I Wanted to know what'they
had to fay, why I should not execute them as Pi-
rates taken in the Fact, as by-my Commission they
could not doubt I had Authority to do. ".
One ofthem ahswer'd in the Name of the rest,
That they had nothing to fay but this, That when
they were taken, the Captain promis'd them their
Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercys But
I told them I knew not what Mercy to shew them >
for, ats^or my self, I had resolv'd to quit the
Island with all my Men, and had taken Passage
with the Captain to go for England: And as for
the Captain, he could not carry them to England,
other than as Prisoners in Irons to be try d for
Mutiny and running away with the Ship; the
Consequence of which, they must needs know,
would be the Gallows; so that I could not tell
which was best for them, unless they had a MSnd
to take their Fate in the Island; if they desir'd that,
I did not care, as J had Liberty to leave it, I had
some Inclination to give them their Lives, if they
thought they could shift on Shote.
They seem'd very thankful for it, said they
would much rather venture to stay there, than to
be carry'd to England to be hang'd; so I left it on
that Issue. ^
'However, the Captain feem'd to make some
Difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them
there: Upon this J seem'd a little angry with the
Captain, and told him, That they were my Priso-
ners, not his; and that seeing I had ofser'd theirs
so much Favour; I would be as good as my Word;
and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I
Would set them at Liberty as I found them ; and
if he did not like it, he might take them again if
he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at Liberty, and bad them re?
tire into the Woods, to the Place whence they
came,, and I would leave them some Fire Arms,
some Ammunition, and some Directions how they
should live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this, I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship,
but told the Captain, that I would stay that Night
to prepare my Things, and desir'd him to go on
Board in the mean Tj'me, and keep all right in
the Ship, and send the Boat on Shore the next Day
for me; ordering him, in the mean time, to cause
the new Captain who was kill'd, to be hang'd at
the Yard-Arm, that these Men might see him.
When the Caiptain was gone, I sent for theMen
up to me to my Apartment, and enter'd seripusly
into Discourse with them of their Circumstances;
I told them, I thought they had made a right
Choice; that if the Captain carry'd them away,
they would certainly be hang'd. I shewed them
the new Captain hanging at the Yard-Arm of the
Ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect.
When they had all declar'd their willingness to
stay, I then told them, I would let them int° &
''' 1 - 1 .«..• flu-m into the

gave them the whole History of the Place, and ot
my coming to it; shew'd them, my Fortifications,
the way I mad/ my Bread, plajited my Corn, cu-
red my Grapesand in a Word, all that was ne-
cessary to make them easy: I told them the Story
also or the sixteen Spaniards that were to be expect'
ed; for whom I lest a Letter, and made them
prpmise to treat them in common with them-
selves.
I left them my Fire-Arms, viz,. Five Muskets,
three Fowling-Pieces, and three Swords. I had
above a Barrel and half of Powder left; for after
the firjtl Year or two, I used but little, and wasted
none. I gave them a Description of the Way I
managed the Goats, and Directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both Butter and Cheese.
In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own
Story ; and I told them, I would prevail with the
Captain to leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder
more, and some Garden-Seeds, which I told them
I would have been very glad of; also I gave them
the Bag of Pease which the Captain had brought
me to eat, and bad them be sure to sow and en-
prease them.
Having done all this, I left them the next Day,
and went on Board the Ship: We prepar'd imme-
diately to fail, but did not weigh that Night:
The next Morning early, two of the five Men
pame swimming to the Ship's Side, and making a
most lamentable Complaint of the other three,
begg?d to be taken into the Ship, for God's Sake,
for they should be murder'd, and begged the Cap-
tain to take them on Boardj tho' he hang'd them
immediately.
Upon this,, she Captain pretended to have no
Power without me; but after some Difficulty, and
afer their solemn Promises of Amendment, they
were taken on Board, a"d were some time after
soundly whipped and pickled; after which, they
proved very honest and quiet Fellows.
Some time after this, the Boat was ordered on
Shore, the Tide being up, with the Things promi-
sed to the Men, to which the Captain, at my Inter-
cession, caus'd their Chests,and Cloaths to be ad-
ded, which they took, and were very thankful for?
1 also encouraged them, by telling them, that if

it lay in my Way to send any Vessel to ttke;tHem.

When I took Leave of this Island, i carry'd^oa
Board for Reliques the great Goat's Skin Cap I had
made, my Umbrella, and. ope of ray Parrots;
also I forgot not to take the Money I formerly
mention'd, which had lain by me so long useless,
that it was grown rusty, or tarnished, and could
hardly pass for Silver, till it had been a little
rubbed and handled; as also the Money I found
in the Wreck of the .Spanish Ship. - v' - r..T-
i And thus I left the Ifland the Nineteenth of

Day of the Month that I sirst made my Escape in
she Baixo-Longo, srom among the Mtors oiSallee,
In this Vcslcl, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in
England, the Eleventh of June, in the Year 1687,
having been thirty and five Years absent.
When I came to England, I was as persect a
Stranger to all the World, as if I had never been
known there. My Benefactor and faithful Stew
ard,whom I had left in Trust with my Money, was
alive, but had had great Misfortunes in the World;
was become a Widow the second Time,- and very
low in the World; I made her easy a>s to whatfce
ow'd me,affuring her,I wouldgiveher no Trouble;
but on the contrary, in gratitude to her former
Care and Faithfulness to me, 1 relieved her, as my
little Stock would afford, which at that Time
would indeed allow me to do but little for her;
but 1 assur'd her, I would never forget her former
Kindness to me; nor did I sorget her, when I had
sufficient to help her; as shall be observed in its
Place.
I went,
i I went down aftcrwads into Yorkfiht; but tnf
Father was dead, and my Mother, and all the Fa-
mily extinct, except that I found two Sisters, and
two of the Children of one of my Brothers; and as
I had been longago given overfor dead, there had
been no Provision made for me; so that, in a Word,
I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that
little Money I had, Would not do much for me, as
to settling in the World.
I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which
I did not expect; and this-was, That the Master
of the Ship, whom I had so happily deliver'd, and
by the same Means sav'd the Ship and Cargo, ha-'
ving given a very handsome Account to the Own-
ers of the Manner how I had sav'd the Lives of
the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and some other Merchants concern'd, and
all together made me a very handsome Complement
upon the Subject, and a Present of almost two
hundred Pounds Sterling.
But after making several Reslections upon the
Circumstances of my Lise, and how little Way this
would go towards settling me in the World, I re-
solv'd to go to Lisbon, ar.d see if I might not come
by some Information of the State of my Plantation
in the Brasils, and of what was become of my Part-
ner, who I had Reason to suppose had some Years
now given me over for dead.
With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon,
where I arriv'd in April following; my Man Fri-
day accompanying me very honestly in all these
Ramblings, and proving a most fnthrul Servant
upon all Occasions.
Whtn I came to Lisbon, I found out, by Enqui-
ry, and to my particular Satisfaction, my old Friend
the Captain of the Ship, who first took me up at
Sea, off of the Shore of Ajrkk, Jfcle was now
L'. - grown
grown old, and had left osf the Sea, having put
his Son, who was far from a young Man, into his
Ship; and who still used the Bras Trade. The
old Man did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly
knew him; but J soon brought him to my Re-
membrance, and as soon brought myself to his
Remembrance, when I told him who I was.
After some passionate Expressions of the old Ac-
quaintance, I enquir'd, you may be sure, after my
Plantationand my Partner: The old Man told me
he had not been in the Brafils for about nine Years;
but that he could assure me, that when he came
away, my Partner was living, but the Trustees,
who I had join'd with him to take Cognizance of
my Part, were both dead; that however, he be-
liev'd that I would have a very good Account of
the Improvement of the Plantation; for that upon
the general Belief of my being cast away and
drown'd, my Trustees had-^iven jo the Account of
the Produce of, my Par^of the Plantation, to the
Procurator Fiscal; who had appropriated it, in
Case I never came to claim it, one Third to the
King, and two Thirds to the Monastery of St. Au-
gustin, to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor,
and for the Conversion of the Indians to the Ca-
tholick Faith ; but that if I appear'd, or any one
for me, to claim the Inheritance, if stould be rc-
fior'd; only that the Improvement, or annual
Production, heing distributed to charitable Uses,
could not be restor'd; but he assured me, that the
Steward of the King's Revenue (from Lands) and
the Proveoorc, or Steward of the Monastery,
had taken great Care all along, that the Incum-
bent, that is to fay, my Partner, gave every Year
a faithful Accountof the Produce, of which they
receiv'd duly my Moiety.
I ask'd
Iask'd him if he knew to what Height of Im-
provement he had brought the Plantation? And,
whether he thought it might be worth looking af-
ter; or whether, on my going thither, I should
meet with no Obstruction to my possessing my just
Right in the Moiety?
He told me, he could not tell exactly to what
Degree the Plantation was improv'd; but this he
knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding rich,
upon the enjoying but one Half of it; and that, to
the best of his Remembrance, he had heard, that
the King's Third of my Part, which was, it seems,
granted away to some other Monastery, or Reli-
gious House, amounted to above two hundred
Moidores a Year; that as to my being restor'd to a
quiet Possession of it, there was no Question to be
made of that, my Partner being alive to witness
my Title, and my Name being alsoenroll'd in the
Register of the Country; also he told me, that
the Survivors of my two Trustees, were very fair
honest People, and very Wealthy; and he believ'd
I would not only have their Assistance for putting
me in Possession, but would find a very consider-
able Sum of Money in their Hands, for my Ac-
count; being the Produce of the Farm, while their
Fathers held the Trust, and before it was given up,
as above, which, as he remember'd, was tor about
twelve Years.
I shew'd my self a little concern'd, and uneasy
at this Account, and enquir'd os the old Captain,
how it came to pass, that the Trustees should thus
dispose of my Essects, when he knew that I had
made my Will* and had made him, the Portuguese
Captain, my universal Heir, &c.
He told me* that was true; but that as there
was no Proof of my being dead, he could not act
as Executor, until some certain Account should
come
tome of my Death; and that besides, he was not
willing to intetmeddle with a Thing so tcmote:
That it was true, he had Register' d my Will,
and put in his Claim; and could he have given
any Account of my being dead or alive, he would
have a&ed by Procuration, and taken Possession of
the bigtnio (so they call'd the Sugar-house) and
had given his Son, who was now at the Brafils,
Order to do it.
- But, fays the old Man, I have one piece of
News to tell you, which, perhaps, may hpt be so
acceptable to you as the reft, and that is, That
believing you were lost, and all the W/orld believ-
ing so also, your Partner and Trustees did osfer
to accompt to me in your Name, for six of eight
of the first Years of Profit*, which I reœiv d;
but there being at that Time, fays he, great Dis-
bursements for increasing the Works, building an
Ingenio, and buying Slaves, it did not amount to
near so much as afterwards it produc'd : However,
fays the old Man, I shall give you a true Account
of what I have reeciv'd in all, and how I have
dispos'd of it. -'
After a few Days farther Conserence with this
aacient Friend, he brought me an Account of the
fix first Years Income of my Plantation, sign'd by
my Partner, and the Merchant's Trustees, being
always deliver'd in Goods, viz,. Tobacco in Roll,
and Sugar in Chests, besides Rum, Molossus, &c
which is the Consequence of a Sugar-Work; and
I found, by. this Account, that every Year the In'
come considerably Increas'd: But, as above, the
Disbursement being large, the Sum at first'***
small: However, the o!d Man let me see, that he
was'Debtor to me 470 Moidores of Gold, besides
60 Chests of Sugar, and 15 double Rolls of To*
bacco, which were lostin hrs Ship; he having he*1
c nt j
foip-wreck'd coming Home to Lisbtit, abdat it
Years after my leaving the Place.
The good Man then begun to complain of his
Misfortunes, and how he had been oblig'd to make
Use of my Money to recover his Losses, and buy
him a Share in a new Ship: However, my old
Friend, fays he, you shall not want a Supply in
your Necessity; and as soon as my Son returns,
you shall be folly satisfy'd.
: Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and gives
me 160 Portugal Moidores in Gold; ahd giving
me the Writings of his Title to the Ship, which
his Son was gone to the Bra/Ut in, of which he
was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another,
he puts them both into my Hands for Security of
the rest. . . .
I was too much mov'd with the Honesty and
Kindness of the poor Man, to be able to bear this;
and remembring what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at Sea, and how generously he
had used me on all Occasions, , aud, particularly;,
how sincere a Friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me':
Therefore, sirst I ask'd him, if his Circumstances
admitted him to spare, so much Money at thajt
Time, and if it would not straiten him? He, told
me, he could not say but it might straiten him a
little; but however, it was my Money, and I
might want it more than he. . . .'
Every thing the good Man said was full of Af-
section, and I could hardly refrain from Tear's
while he spoke : In short, I took 100 of the Moi-
dores, and call'd for a Pen and Ink to give him a
Receipt forthem; then 1 return'd him the rest, and
told him, if ever I had Possession of the Plantation,
I would returrr the other to him also, as indeed I
afterwards did ; and that as to the Bill of Sale of
.V < u:_
his Part in his Son's Ship, I would not take it by
any Means ; but that if I wanted the Money, I
found he was honest enough to pay me ; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave meRea4
son to expect, I would never have a Penny more
\ from him. . .
When this was pass'd, the old Man began to ask
me, if he should put me in a Method to make my
Claim to my Plantation? I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself: He said, I might do so if I
pleas'd; but that if I did not, there were Ways e-
nough to secure my Right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the Prosits to my Use; and as there were
Ships in the River of Lisbon, just ready to go away
to Braftl, he made me enter my Name in a publick
Register, with his Asfidavit, asfirming upon Oath
that J was alive, and that I was the fame Person
who took up the Land for the Planting the said
Plantation at first.
This being regularly attested by a Notary, and
a Procuration asfix'd, he directed me to send it with
a Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant of his Ac-
quaintance at the Place, and then propos'd my
staying with him 'till an Account came of the Re^
turn.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
Proceedings upon this Procuration; for in less than
seven Months I receiv'd a large Packet from the
Survivors of my Trustees, the Merchants, for whose
Account I went to Sea, in which were the follow-
ing particular Letters and Papers enclos'd.
First, There was the Account Current of the
Produce of my Farm, or Plantation, from the Year
when their Fathers had belanc'd with my old Por-
tugal Captain, being for six Years; rhe Balance
appear'd to be 1174 Moidores in my Favour.
Sesnfdlh
Secondly, There was the Accounr of four years
more, while they kept the Esfects in their Hands,
before the Government claim'd the Adrnihistra*
tion, as being the Essects of a Person not to be
found, which they call Civil Death; and the Bal-
lance of this, the Value of the Plantation ehcrea-
fing, amounted to Cruifadoes, which made
3241 Moidores.
Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Atigufliris
Account, who had receiv'd the Profits for above
fourteen Years . but not being to account for what
was dispos'd to the Hospital, very honestly deelar'd
he had 872 Moidores not distributed, which he
acknowledged to my Account: as to the King's
Part, that refunded nothing.
There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratula-
ting me very assectionately upon my being alive*
giving me an Account how the Estate was im-
prov'd, and what it produe'd a Year, with a Par*
ticularofthe Number of Squares or Acres that it
contain'd; how planted, how many Slaves there
were upon it; ahd making two and twenty Crosses
for Blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Ma-
ria's to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive j
inviting me very passionately to come over and
take Possession of my own, and in the mean time
to give him Orders to whom he should deliver my
Essects, if I did not come myself; concluding
w'ith a hearty Tender of his Friendship, and that
of his Family, and sent me, as a Present, seven
fine Leopards Skins, which he had, it seems, recei-
ved from Afrrck, by some other Ship which he had
,sent thither, and who, it seems, had made a better
Voyage than I: He sent me also five Chests of ex-
cellent Sweetmeats, and an Hundred Pieces of
Gold uncoin'd, not quite so large as Moidores.

bacco, and the rest of the whole Accomptin Gold.
- I; might well fay now, indeed, That the latter
£9ft pf 7<* was better than the Beginning. It is
L™P0'?1ble to express the Fluttering? of my very
Heart, when I look'd over these Letters, and espe-
cially when I found all my Wealth about me; for
as ,rhe Brafil Ships come all in Fleets, the fame
Ships which brought my Letters, brought my
£ppds , and the Effects were sase in the River be-
fore the Letter came to my Hand. In a Word,
t tum'd pale, and grew sick; and had not the old
Man run and setch'd mea Cordial, I believe the
Hidden Surprize of Joy had overset Nature, and I
had dy'd upon the Spot.
- Nay, after that I continued very ill, and was so
spme Hours, 'till a Physician being sent for, and
something of the real Cause fof my Illness being
known*. he order'd me to be let' Blood: after
which I had Relief, and grew well: But I verily
bdieve, if it had not been eas'd by the Vent given
ia tihat Manner to the Spirits, I should have
-. I. was now Master, all on a sudden, of above
jooo /. Sterling in Money, and had an Estate, as
I might well call it, iii the Brafil, of above a
thousand Pounds a Year, as sure as an Estate of
Lands in England; And, in a Word, I was in a
Condition which I scarce knew how to understand,
or how to compose myself for the Enjoyment
of it.
-The first Thing I did, was to recompence my
original Benefactor, my good old Captain, who
had been first Charitable to me in my DistrefSi
Kind to mein the Beginnings and Honest to me at
the End: I shew'd him.all that was sent me; 1
'tola
£ m \
told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven,
which disposes all Things, it was owing to him;
and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
I would do a hundred Fold: So I first returned to,,
him the hundred Moidores I had received of him,
then I sent for a Notary, and caused him to draw,
up a General Release or Discharge for the 470
Moidores, which he had acknowledged he ow'dme,
in the fullest and firmest manner possible; after
which, I caus'd a Procuration to be drawn, im-,
powering him to be my Receiver of the Annual Pror,
fits of my Plantation, and appointing my Partner:
to Accompt to him, and make the Returns by the
usual Fleets to him in my Name: And a Clause. fn\
the End, being.a Grant os 100 Moidores a Year to
him, during his Lise, out of the Essects, and 50
Moidores a'Yearto his Son after him, for his Lise:t
And thus I requited my old Man.
I was now to consider which Way to steer my
Course next, and what to do with the Estate that
Providence had thus put into my Hands; and, in-
deed, I had more Care upon my Head now, than
I had in my silent State of Life in the Island,
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and
had nothing but what I wanted: Whereas I had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Business
was how to secure it. I had ne'er a Cave now to
hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye
without Lock Or Key, 'till it grew mouldy and
tarnish'd before any Body would meddle with it 1
On the contrary, Tknew not where to put it, ot
who to trust with it. My old Patron, the Cap-
tain, indeed was honest, and that was the only
Refuge I had. v - .
In the next Place, my Interest in the Brasils
seem'd to summon me thither ; but now I could
not cell how to chink of going thither, 'till I had
2 2 fettled
settled my Asfairs, and left my Esfects in some safe
Hands behind me. At sirst i thought of my old
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honest, and
would be just tome; but then she was in Years,
and but poor, and, for ought I knew, might be in
Debt; so that, in a Word, I had no Way bat to
go back to England myself, and take my Esfects
with me.
It was some Months however before I resolved
upon this; and therefore, as I had rewarded the
old Captain fully, and to Satisfaction, who had
been my former Benefactor, so I began to think of
my poor Widow, whose Husband had been my
first Benefactor, and slie, while it was in her Power,
my faithsul Steward and Instructor. So the first
Thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write to
his Correspondent in London, not only to pay a
Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in Mo-
jiey an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with
her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling
her, she should, if I liv'd, have a further Supply
At the fame time I sent my two Sisters in the
Country, each of them an hundred Pounds, they
being, though not in Want, yer not in very good
Circumstances; one having been marry'd, and left,
a Widow, and the other having a Husband not so
kind to her as he should be-
But among all my Relations or Acquaintances,
I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durst
commit the the Gross of my Stock, that I might go
away to the Byasils, and leave Things sase behind
me; and this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brasils,
and have settled myself there; for I was, as
were, naturaliz'd to the Place; but I had some lit-
tle Scruple in my Mind about Religion, which in*
sensibly drew me back, of which. lihall/ay m9.re
i ^ present!)'.
presently. However, it was not Religion that
kept me from going there for the present; and as
I had made no Scruple of being openly of the Re^
ligion of the Country, all the while I was among
them, so neither did I yet -, only that now and
then having of late though: more of it, (than for-
merly) when I began to think of living and dy-
ing among them, I began to regret my having
prosefs'd my self a Papist, and thought it might
not be the best Religion to die with.
But, as I have said, this was not the main Thing
that kept me from going to the Bmfils; but that
really 1 did not know with whom to leave my Ef-
sects behind mei so I resolv'd at last to go to Eng-
land with it,where, if I arriv'dj concluded I should
make some Acquaintance, or find some Relations
that would be faithful to me; and accordingly I
prepar'd to go for England with all my Wealth.
In order to prepare Things for my going Home,
I first (the Brafil Fleet being just going away) re-
solv'd to give Answers suitable to the just and faith-
ful Account of Things 1 had from thence; and first
to the Prior of St. Auguftint-X wrote a Letter full of
Thanks for their just Dealings, and the Offer of
the 872 Moidores, which was indispos'd of, which
I desir'd might be given, 500 to the Monastery,and
372 to the Poor, as the Prior should direct, desi-
ring the good Padres Prayers for me, and the like.
I wrote next, a Letter of thanks to my two
Trustees,, with all the Acknowledgment that so
much Justice and Honesty call'd for ., as for send-
ing them any Present, they were far above hav-
ing any Occasion of it.

ment
men t of my Part, according to the Powers I had
left with my oldPatron» to whom I desir'd him to
send whatever became due to me, 'til) he should
hear from me more particularly; assuring him, that
it was my Intension, not only to come to him, but
to settle myself there for the Remainder of my
Lise: To this I added a very handsome Present of
some Italian Silks for his Wife and two Daughters,
for such the Captain's Son inform'd me he had;
with two Pieces of fine Englijh Broad-Cloath, the
best I could get in Lisbon, five Pieces of black Bays,
and some Flanders Lace of a good Value.
Having thus settled my Affairs, fold roy Cargoe,
and turn'd all my Effects into good Bills of Ex-
change, my next Difficulty was, which Way to go
to England: I had been accustom'd enough to the
Sea, and yet I had a strange Aversion to go to
Englandhy Sea at that Time; and though I could
give no Reason for it, yet the Dffiiculty encreas^'d
upon me so much, that though I had.once shipp'd
my. Baggage in order to go, yet I altered my Mind,
and that not once, but two or three times.
Ib is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea,
and^is'might be some of the Reasons: But let
no Man slight the strong Impulses of his own
Thoughts in Cases of such Moment: Two of the
Ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean,
more particularly singled out than any other, that
is to fay, so as in one of them to put my Things on
Board, ahd in the other to have agreed with the
Captain; I fay, two of these Ships miscarry 'd,viz,.
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other
was cast away on the Stan nezt Tmbay, and all the
People drown'd except three; so thar in either of
those Vessels I had been made miserable, and in
which most, it was hard to fay. -
. Iu.j Having
Having been thus harass'd in my Thoughts, my
old Pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
presi'd me earnestly not to go by Sea; but either
to go by Land to the Groyne, and cross over the
Bay of Biscay to Rochell, from whence it was but
an easy and sase Journey by Land to Paris, and so
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and
so all the Way by Land through France.
Ina Word, I was so prepossess'd against my going
fcy Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, thac
I resolv'd to travel all rhe Way by Land; which,
as 1 was not in Haste, and did cot value the
Charge, was by much the pleasanter Way; and to
make it more so, my old Captain brought an Eng-
Ujl) Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon,
who was willing to Travel with me: After which,
we pick'd up two moreEnglifo Merchants also, and
two young Portuguese Gentlemen, the last going tq
Paris only -y so that we were in all six of us, and
five Servants; the two Merchants, and the two
Portuguese contenting themselves with one Servant
between two, to save the Charge; and as for mej
I got an Eugiijb Sailor to travel with me as a Ser-
vant, besides my Man Friday, who was too much
a Stranger, to be capable of i'uppliyng the Place
of a Servant on the Road.
In this Manner 1 sent out from Lisbon; and our
Company being all very well mounted and arm'd,
we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the
Honour to call me Captain, as well because I waj
the oldest Man, as because 1 had two Servants,
and, indeed, was the Original of the whole
Journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my Sea
Journals, so I shall trouble you now with none ojt
my Land Journal: But some Adyeutures that hapr
Z ^ pen'd
frn'd to us in this tedious and disficult Joutney, I
must not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all os us
Strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some Time
to see the Court of Spain, and to fee what was
worth observing; but it being the latter Part of
the Summer, we hasten'd a way, and set out from
Madrid about the Middle of OBeber: But when we
came to the Edge of Navarre, we werealaram'd
at several Towns on the Way, with an Account,
that so much Snow was fallen on the French Side
of the Mountains, that several Travellers were
oblig'd to come back to Pampeluna, after having
attempted at an extreme Hazard, to pass on.
W hen we came to Pampeluna it self, we found it
so indeed ; and to me rhat had been always used
to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where
we could scarce bear any Cloathson, the Cold was
Insusferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than
it was surprizing, to come but ten Days before out
of the Old Castile, where the Weather was not only
warm, but very hot; and immediately to seel a
Wind from the Pwenean Mountains, so very keen,
so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en-
danger benumming aud perishing of our Fingers
and Toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw she
Mountains all cover'd with Snow, and felt cold
Weather, which he had never seen or selt before
in his Lise.
To mend r>c Matter, when we came to Pass
feluna, ir conrinu'd Snowing with so much Vio-
lence, and so long, that the People said, Winter
was come before its Time, and the Roads, which
Were difficult before, were now quire impassable -f
for, in a Word, the Snow lav in some Places too
thick for us to Travel; and being not hard frozen,
as
#
... [ 345
as in «;hc Case in NorthernCountrics, there was no
going without being in Danger of being bury'd
alive every Step; We staid no less than twenty
Days at Pampelum; when (seeing the Winter
coming on-, and no likelyhood of its being better,
for it was the severest. Winter all over Europe
that had been known in the Memory of Man) I
proposed that we should all go away to Fonterabia,
and there take Shipping for Bourdeaux, which
was a very little Voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came
in four French Gentlemen, who having been stop-
ped oh the French side of the Passes, as we were on
the Spanijh, had found out a Guide, who traver-
sing the Country near the Head of Languedoc, had
brought them over the Mountains by such Ways,
that they were not much incommoded with the
Snow; and where they met with Snow in any
Quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to
bear them and their Horses.
We sent for this Guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the fame Way, with no Ha-
zard from the Snow, provided we werearm'd suf-
ficiently to protect us from wild Beasts; for, he
said, upon these great Snows, it was frequent for
some Wolves to show themselves at the Foot of
the Mountains, being made ravenous for want of
Food, the Ground being cover'd with Snow: We
told htm we were well enough prepared for such
Creatures as they were, if he would ensure us from
a Kind of two legged Wolves, which we were told
we were in most Danger from, especially on the
French Side of the Mountains.
He satisfy'd us there was no Danger of that Kind
in the Way that we were to go: So we readily a-
greed to follow him, as did also twelve other Gen-
tlemen,
rlemen, with their Servants, some French, some
Spamfi, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and
were oblig'd to come back again.
Accordingly we all set out for Pampeluna,viub.
our Guide, on the fifteenth of November; and in-
deed, 1 was sorpriz'd, when instead of going for-
ward, he came directly back with us, on the fame
Road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
Miles \ when, being pass'd two Rivers, and come
into the plain Country, we found our selves in a
WarmClimate again, where the Country was plea-
sant, and no Snow to be seen; but on a sudden,
turning to the Left, he approach'd the Mountains
another Way; and tho' it is true, the Hills and
Precipices look'd dreadful, yet he made so many
Tours, such Meanders, and led us by such wind-
ing Ways, that we were insensibly pass'd the
Height of the Mountains, without being much
incumber'd with the Snow; and all on a sudden
he shew'd us the pleasant fruitful Provinces of
hangueitc -aud Gascoign, all green and slourishing;
tho' indeed it was at a great Distance, and we had
some rough Way to pass yet.
...We were a little uneasy however, when we
found it snow'd one whole Day, and at Nights
lo fast, that we could not travel; but he bids us,
be easy, we mould soon be past it all: We found,
indeed, that we began to descend every Day,
and to come more North than before, and so
depending upon our Guide, we went on.
it was about two Hours before Night, when
qur Guide being something before us, and not just
in Sight,out rufh'd three monstrous Wolves, and
after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoyn-
ing to a thick Wood ; two of the Wolves slew up-
on the Guide, aud had he been half a Mile before
us, he had been devour'd indeed, before we could
have
0 347 Jj
have help'd him: One of them fasten'd upon h}s
Horse, and the other attacked the Man with that
Violence, that he had not Time, or not Presence
of Mind enough to draw his Pistol, but hollowed
and cry'd out to us most lustily; my Man Friday
being next to me, I bid him ride up, and see what
was the Matter: As soon as Friday came in Sight
of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as t'other, O Ma-
ster! O Master! But like a bold Fellow, rode di-
rectly up to the poor Man, and with his Pistol
shot the Wolf that attacked him into the Head,
It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my
Man Friday ; for he having been used to that kind
of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon
him; but went close up to him, and shot him, as
above; whereas any of us would have fir'd at a
farther Distance, and have perhaps either mils'd
the Wolf, or endanger'd mooting the Man-
But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder
Man than I, and indeed it alarm'd all our Compa-
ny, when with the Noise of Friday's Pistol, we
heard on both Sides the disinallest howling of
Wolves, and the Noise redoubled by the Eccho of
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had
been a prodigious Multitude of them ; and perhaps
indeed, there was not such a sew, as that we had
no Cause of Apprehensions.
However, as Fridayhad killed this Wolf, the o-
ther, that had fasten'd upon the Hotse, left him im-
mediately, and sled, having happily fasten'd upon
his Head, where the Bosses of the Bridle had stuck
in his Teeth, so that he had not done him much
Hurt: The Man, indeed, was most hurt; for the
raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the
Arm, and the other Time a little above his Knee;
and he was just as it w ere tumbling down by the
Disorder
r*4* j
Disorder of the Horse, when Friday came up sa/f
{hot the Wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the Noise xA Erf-
day's Pistol, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as
fast as the Way (which was very difficult) would
-give us Leave, to see what was the Matter; as
soon as we came clear of the Trees, which blinded
xts before, we saw clearly what had been the Case,
and how Friday had disengaged the poor Guide;
though we did not presently discern what Kind of
Creature it was he had killed-
But never was a Fight œanag'd so hardily, and
in Inch a surprizing Manner,as that which follow'd
between Friday and the Bear, which gave us all
(though at sirst we were surpriz'd and afraid for
him) the greatest Diversion imaginable- As die
Bear is a heavy, clumsey Creature, and does no?
gallop as the Wolf does, who is swift and light;
so he has two particular Qual ities, which generally
are the Rule o(his Actions; First, As to Men, wha
are not his proper Prey, I fay, not his proper Prey,
becatise,tho'I can't fay what excessive hunger might
do, which was now their Case, the Ground being
all cover'd with Snow; but as to Men, he does not
usually attempt them, unless they first attack him:
On the contrary, if you meet him in the Woods, if
you don't meddle with him, he won't meddle with
you ;but then you must take care to be very civil
to him, and give him the Road, for he is a very
nice Gentleman, he won't go a step out of his Way
for a Prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your
best way is to look another Way, and keep going
on; for sometimes, if you slop, and stand still, and
look sledfastly at him, he takes itfor an Asfront; but
if you throw ot toss any thing at him, and it hits
him, though it were but a Bit or Stick as big as
your Finger, he takes it for an Affront, and sets all
his
bis other Business aside to pursue his Revenge,
for he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour,
that is his first Quality: The next is, That if he
be once affronted, he will never leave you, Night
or Day, till he has his Revenge, but follows at
a good round Rate, till he overtakes you.
My Man Friday had delivered our Guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his Horse, for the Mail was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first;
when on the sudden, we spy'd the Bear come out
of the Wood, and a vast monstrous one it was,
the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a
little surprized when we saw him, but when Fridaf
saw him, it was easy to see Joy and Courage in the
fellow's Countenance :0!0!0! fays Friday, three
Times pointing to him, 0 Master! You give me to
Leave, me Jbdkee to Hand rtitb him, me make you good
laugh.
f was surpriz'd to see the Fellow so pleas'd; Toii
Fool you, fays I, be viill eat youup: Eatee me up I Eatee
me up! fays Friday, twice over again; Me eatee
him up: Me make you good Laugh: You aSstay here,
pie stow you good Laugh: So down he sits, and gets
his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a Piir of
tumps, (as we call the flat Shoes they wear) and
which he had in his Pocket, gives my other Ser-
vant his Horse, and, with his Gun, away he slew,
swist like the Wind.
The Bear was walking softly oh, and ofser'd to
meddle vith no Body, till Friday coming pretty
near, calls to hirst, as if the Bear could understand
him ; Hark ye, hark ye, fays Friday, me sfeakee toil
you: We follow'd at a Distance; for now being
comedown on the Gascoign Side of the Mountains,
we were enter'd a vast great Forest, where the
Country was plain, and pretty open, tho' many
T rces in it scatter'd here and there. Friday
t ]50 j
Friday, who hid, as we say, the Heels of the Bear,
came up with him quickly, and talcerup a great
Stone and throws at him, and hit'him just on the
Head; but did him no more Harm, than if he had
thrown it against a Wall; but it aniwer'd Friday's
End; for the Rogue was so void of Pear, that he
did it purely to' make the Bear 'follow him, and
stow us some Laugh, as he call'd it.
As soon as the Bear selt the Stone, and saw him,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking devi-
lish long Strides, and shuffling along at a strange
Rate, so as would put a Horse to a middling Gal-
lop; away runs Friday, and takes his Course, as if
be run towards us for Help; so we all resolved to
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man;
tho' I was angry at him heartily sot bringing the
Bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own Business another Way; and especially I
was angry that he had turned the Bear upon us, and
then run away; and I call'd out Tbu Dog, said I,
is this year. making us laugh ? Come aviaj, and take your
Horse, that we may /boot the Creature; he hears me,
and cries out, No Jhoot, no Jhoot, stand JIM, you get
.much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two
Foot for the Beast's one, he tutn'd on a sudden, on
one Side of us, and seeing a great Oak-Tree, sit for
his Purpose, he beckon'd us to follow, and dou-
bling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying
his Gun down upon the Ground, at about five or
six Yatds from the Bottom of the Tree.
The Bear soon came to the Tree, and we rot*
low'd at a Distance; the first Thing he did, he
flopp'd at the Gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and
up he scrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat,
tho' so monstrously heavy: I was amazed at the
Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could not
for my Lise lee any Thing to laugh ac yet, till see-
ing
ing the Bear get up the Tree, We all rode nearer
to him.
When we came to the Tree, there was Friday
got out to the small of a large Limb of the
Tree, and the Bear got about half Way to him;
as soon as the Bear got out to that Part where the
Limb of the Tree was weaker, Ha, fays he tt> u$,
now you see me teachee the Beardance; so he falls a
jumping and shaking the Bough, at which theBeaV
began to totter, but stood still, and began to look
ibehindhim, to see how he should get back; then
indeed we did laugh heartily: But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal; when he sees him
stand still, he calls out to him .again, as if he had
iuppos'd the Bear could speak Englijh; What, you
.no come farther I Pray you come farther; so he left
jumping and shaking the Bough; andthe Bear, just
as if he had understood what he said, did cornea
little, far [her, then he fell a jumping again, and
the Bear stopp'd again.' z
We thought now was a good Time to knock him
4Xi the Head, and called to Friday to stand still,
and we would shoot the Bear; but he cry'd out
earnestly,. 0 fray/- O pray! no jhoot, me fioot by and
then; he would have said, by and by. However, to
shorten the Story, Friday dane'd so much, anil
the Bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing
enough indeed, but still could not imagine what
theFellow wouldi do; for first we thought he de-
pended upon shaking the Bear osf; and we found
the Bear was to<9 .cunning for, that too; for he
would not go out far enough to be thrown down,
t)ut clings fast with his great broad Claws and
Feet, ;so -that \Ve:.cpuld not imagine what would
. and where the Jest would be
be the End of it, and where the Jest
ac last. ;'am:.*. -Ay I . n
Luvj .' But
But Friday put us out of Doubt quickly; for
seeing the Bear cling fast to the Bougfi, ahdthat
he would not be perswaded to come any farther;
tyell, well, said Friday, you no come farther, me go,
me go; you no come to me, me come to you; and upon
this, he goes out to the smallest End of the Bough,
where it would bend With his Weight, and gently
lets himself down by it, (tiding down the Bough,
till he came near enough to Jump down on his Feer,
and away he run to his Gun, takes it up, and
stands still.
Well, said I to him, Priddy, What Will you do
now? Why don't you Ihoot him? No /boot, says
Friday, no yet, meJboct now, meno kiO; me stay, give
you one more Laugh: And indeed so he did, as you
will see presently; for when the Bear see his Ene-
my gone, he comes back from the Bough where he
stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind
him every Step, and coming backward till he
got into the Body of the Tree: then with the
lame hinder End foremost, he came down the
Tree, grasping it with his Claws, and moving
one Foot at a Time, very leisurely; ar this Jutr-
cture, and just before he could let his hind Feet
upon the Ground, Friday stepp'd close to him,
clapp'd the Muzzel of his Piece into his Ear, and
shot him dead as a Stone.
Then thft Rogue turn'd about, to see if we did
not laugh, and when he saw we were pleas'd by
our Looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud;
So we kiS Bear in my Country, says Friday, so you
kill them, says I, why you have no Guns: N°,
fays he, no Gun, butjhoot great much long Arrow.
This was, indeed, a good Divcrfion to us} but
we were still in a wild Place, arid our Guide very
much hurt* and what to do we hardly knew; the
Howling of Wolves run much in my Head; and in-
deed
deed, except the Noise I once heard on the Shore
of Africa, of which I have said something already,
I never heard any thing that sill'd me with so much
Horror.
These things, and the Approach of Night, cal-
led us off, or else, as Friday would have had us*
we mould certainly have taken the Skin of this
monstrous Creature off, which was worth saving;
but we had three Leagues to go, and our Guide
hasten'd us, so we lert him and went forward on
our Journey.
The Ground was still cover'd with Snow, tho*
not so deep and dangerous as on the Mountains,
and the ravenous, Creatures, as we heard after-
wards, were come down into the Forest and plain
Country, press'd by Hunger to seek for Food; and.
had done a great deal os Mischief in the Villages,,
where they surpriz'd the Country People, kill'd a
great many of their Sheep and Horses, and some
People too.
We had one dangerous Place to pass, which
our Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves
in the Country, we Ihould find them there; and
this was a small Plain, surrounded with Woods
on every Side, and a long narrow Desile or Lane,
which we were to pass to get through the Wood,
and then we should come to the Village where we
were to lodge.
It was within half an Hour of Sun-set when we
enter'd the first Wood; and a little after Sun-set,
when we came into the Plain, we met with no-
thing in the first Wood, except that in a little
Plain within the Wood, which was not above two
Furlongs over, we saw five great Wolves cross the
Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had
been in Chase of some Prey, and had it in View,
A a the/
r
they took no Notice of us, and were gone/3a
out of our Sight in a sew Moments.
1 Upon this our Guide, who by the Way was a
wretched faint-hearted Fellow, bid us keep in a
ready Posture: for he believ'd there were more
Wolves a coming.
We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us,
but we saw no more Wolves, 'til! we came thro'
that Wood, which was near half a League, and en-
ret'd the Plain; as soon as we came into the Plain,
we had Occasion enough to look about us; The
first Object we met with, was a dead Horse i
that it to fay, a poor Horse which the Wolves
had kill'd, and at least a Dozen of them at Work ;-
we could not fay eating of him, but picking of his
Bones rather; for they had eaten up all the Flefii
before. '.
We did not think sit to desturb them at their
Feast, neither did they take much Notice of
us: Friday would have let sly. ac them, but I
would not surfer him by any Means; for I found
We were like to have more Business upon our
Hands than we were aware of, We were not
gone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the
Wolves houl in the Wood on our Lcfr, in a fright-
ful Manner, and presently after We saw about a
hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a
Body, and most of them in a Line, as regularly 2S
an Army drawn up by experiene'd Officers. I
scarce knew in what Manner to receive them;
but found to draw ourselves in a close Line was
the only way: So we form'd in a Moment: But
that we might not have too much Interval, I or-
der'd, that only every other Man should fire, and
that the others who had not fir'd would stand rea-
dy to gfve them a second Volley immediately, if
they continu'd to advance upon us, and that then
. those
those who had fir'd at first, should not pretend to
load their Fuzees again, but stand ready with every
one a Pistol, for we were all arm'd with a Fuzee,
and a Pair of Pistols each Man; so we were by
this Method able to fire six Volleys, half of us at
a Time; however, at present we had no Necessi-
ty : for upon firing the first Volley, the Enemy
made a full Stop, being terrify'd as well with the
Noise, as with the Fire; four of them being shot
into the Head dropp'd, several others were wound-
ed, and went bleeding osf, as we could see by the
Snow, I found they stopp'd, but did not immedi-
ately retreat; whereupon remembring that 1 had
been told, that the fiercest Creatures were terri-
fy'd at the Voice of a Man, I caus'd all our Com-
pany to hollow as loud as we c.ould; and I found
the Notion not altogether mistaken; for upon
our Shout, they began ro retire, and turn about;
then I order'd a second Volley to be fir'd, in their
Rear, which put them to the Gallop, and away
they went to the Woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our Pieces again,
and that we might lose no Time we kept going;
but we had but little more than loaded our Fu-
zees, and put our selves into a Readiness, when
we heard a terrible Noise in the fame Wood, on
our Left, only that it was farther onward the
fame Way we were to go.
The Night was coming on, and the Light be*
ganto be dusky, which made it worse on our Side;
but the Noise encreasing, we could easily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling ot those hel-
lish Creatures; and on a sudden, we perceiv'd 2 ot
3 Troops of Wolves, one on our left, one behind
us, and one on our Front; so that we scem'd to
be surrounded with 'em; howerer, as they did not
fall upon us, we kept our Way forward, as fast as
A a a we
we could make our Horses go, which the Way be:
ing very rough, was only a good large Trot; and
in this manner we came in View of the Entrance-,
of a Wood, thro which we were to pals, at the
farther lide of the Plain; but we were greatly
surpnVd, when coming near the Lane, or Pass,
we saw a confus'd Number of Wolves standiug
just at the Entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the Wood,
we heard the Noise of a Gun; and looking that
Way, our rush'd a Horse, with a Saddle, and a
Bridle on him, slying like the Wind, and sixteen
or seventeen Wolves after him, full Speed; in-
deed, the Horse had the Heels of them 5 but as
we suppos'd that he could not hold it at that rate,
we doubted not but they would get up wish him
at last, and no question but they did.
For here we had a most horrible Sight; for ri-
ding up to the Entrance where the Horse came
out,we found theCarcassof another HoTse,and of
two Men, devour'd by the ravenous Crcaturcs,and
one of the Men was no doubt the fame who we
heard fire the Gun; for there lay a Gun just by
him fir'd off; but as to the Man, his Head, and
the upper Part of hi.« Body, was eaten up.
This fill'd us with Horror, and we knew not
what Course to take, but the Creatures resblv'd us
soon i for they gather'd about us prescntly,in hopes
of Prey; and I verily believethere were three hun-
dred of them : It happen'd very much to our Ad-
vantage, that at the Entrance into the Wood, but
a little Way from it, there lay some large Timber
Trees, which had been cut down the Summer be-
fore, and I suppose, lay there for Carriage; I
drew my link Troop in among those Trees, and
placing our selves in a Line, behind one long
Tree, I advis'd them all to Light, and keeping
that
that Tree before us, for a Breast-Work, to stand
in a Triangle, or three Fronts, enclosing our
Horses in the Center.
We did so, and it was weH we did i for never
was a more furious Charge than the Creatures
made upon us in this Place; they came on us with
a growling kind of a noise and mounted the Piece
of Timber, (whichas 1 said, was our Breast-Work,
as if they were only rushing upon their Ptey ,
and this Fury of theirs, it seems, was principally
occasion'd by their seeing our Horses behind us,
which was the Prey they aimed at: I order'd
our Men to fire as before, every other Man * and
they took their Aim so lure, that indeed they,
kill'd several of the Wolves at the first Volley;
but there was a Necessity to keep a continual
Firing \ for they came on like Devils, those be-
hind, pushing on those before.
When we had fir'd our second Volley of our
Fuzees, we thought they slopp'd a little, and I
hop'd they would have gone off; but it was but a
Moment; for, others came forward again; so we
fir'd two Volleys of our Pistols, and I believe in.
these four Firings, we kill'd seventeen or eigh-
teen of them, and lam'd twice as many; yet
they came on again.
I was loath to spend our last Shot too hastily; so
I call'd my Servant,not my Man Friday, for he was
better em ploy'd-, for. with the greatest Dexterity
imaginable, he had charg*d my Fuzee, and his
own, while we were engag'd, but as I said, I call'd
my other Man, and giving him a Horn of Powder,
lbad him lay a Train, all along the Piece os Tim-
ber, and let it be a large Train; he did so, and had
but just Time to get away, when the Wolves came
up to it, and some were got up upon 'rt ., when
I snapping an uncharg'd Pistol, close to the Pow-
Aa3 der,
der, set it on sire; those that were upon the Tim-
ber were scorch'd with it, and six or seven of
them sell, or rather jump?d in among us, with
the Force and Fright of the Fire, we dispatched
these in an Instant, and the rest were so frighted
with the Light, which the Night, for it was
now very near dark, made more terrible, that
they drew back a little.
Upon which I order'd our last Pistols to de fir'd
off in one Volley» and after that we gave a Shout;
upon this, the Wolves turn'd Tail, and we sal-
ly'd immediately upon near twenty lame Ones,
who We found strugling on the Ground, and
sell a cutting them with our Swords, which an-
swer'd our Expectation ; for the Crying and Howl-
ing they made was better understood by their Fel-
lows, so that they all sled and left us.
. We had, first and last, kill'd about.threescore
of them; and had it been Day-light, we had
kill'd many more: The Field of Battle being thus
clear'd, we made forward again; for we had still
near a League,'to go. We heard the ravenous
Creatures howl and yell in the Woods as we went,
several times; and sometimes we fancy'd we saw
some of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes,
we were not certain; so in about an Hour more,
we came to the Town, where we were to lodge,
which we found in a terrible Fright; and all in
Arms; for it seems, that the Night before, the
Wolves and some Bears had broke into the Vil-
lage, and put them in a terrible Fright; and they
were oblig'd to keep Guard Night and Day, but
especially in the Night, to preserve their Cattle,
and indeed their People.
The next Morning our Guide was so ill, and his
Limbs swcll'd with the rankling of his two Wounds^
that he could go noiarther; so we were oblig'd to
take
take a new Guide there, and go to Tholouse, where
we found a warm Climate, a fruitful pleasant Coun-
try and no Snow, no Wolves, or any Thing like
them; but when we told our Story atlbolouse, they
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great Forest at the Foo: of the Mountains, efpeci-*
ally when the Snow lay on the Ground. But they
cnquir'd much what kind of a Guide we had got-
ten, chat would venture to bring us that Way in
such a severe Season; and told us, it was very much
we were not all devour'd. When we told them how
we plac'd our selves, and the Horses in the middle,
they blam'd us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty
to one but we had been all destroy'd; for it was the
Sight of the Horses which made the Wolves so st>
rious, seeing their Prey ; and that at other Times
they are really afraid of a Gun; but they being ex-
cessive hungry, and raging on that Account, the
Eagerness to come at the Horses had made them
senseless of Danger; and that if we had not by the
continu'd Fire, and at last by the Stratagem of the
Train of Powder, master'd them, it had been great
Odds but that we had been torn to pieces; where-
as had we been content to have fat still on Horse-
back, and fir'd as Horsemen, they would not have
taken the Horses so much for their own when Men
were on their Backs, as otherwise ; and withal they
told us, that at last, if we had stood altogether,
and left our Horses, they would have been so eager
to have devour'd them, that they might have come
off sase, especially having our Fire Arms in our
Hands, and being so many in Number.
For my Part, I was never so sensible of Danger
tn my Lise; for seeing above three hundred Devils
come roaring and open-mouth'd to devote us, and
have nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, 1 gave
myself over for lost ;and as it was, I believe, I
Aa 4 slwii

stall never care to cross those Mountains again; I
think I would much rather go a thousand Leagues
by Sea, though I were sure to meet with a Storm
once a Week.
I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in
my Passage through France; nothing but whato-
ther Travellers have given an Account of, with
much more Advantage than I can. I traveled from
l'houlouse to Paris, and without any considerable
Stay, came to Callais, and landed sase at Dover, the
fourteenth of January, after having had a severe
cold Season to travel in.
I was now come ro the Center of my Travels,
and had in a little Time all my new discover' d E-
state sase about me, the Bills of Exchange which I
brought with me having been very currentlypaid.
My principal Guide, and Privy-Counsellor, was
my good ancient Widow, who in Gratitude for the
Money I had sent her, thought no Pains too much,
or Care too great, to employ forme; and I trusted
her so entirely with every Thing, that J was per-
sectly easy as to the Security of my Essects; and in-
deed, I was very happy from my Beginning, and
now to the End, in the unspotted Integrity of this
good Gentlewoman.
And now / began to th;'nk of leaving my Esfects
with this Woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and
so to the Brajih; but now another Scruple came in
my Way, and that was Religion; for as I had en-
tertain'd some Doubts about the Roman Religion,
even while I was abroad, especially in my State of
Solitude; so I knew there was no going to the Bra-
fils for me, much lessgoing to settle there, unless *
resolv'd to embrace the Roman Catholick Religion,
without any Reserve; unless on the other hand, I
resolv'd to be a Sacrisice to my Principles, be *
Martyr for Religion, and die in the Iniquisition; f»
I re-
1 resolv'd to stay at Home, and if I could sind
Means for it, to dispose of my Plantation.
To this Purpose I wrote to my old Friend at
Lisbon, who in Return gave me Notice, that he
could easily dispose of it there: But that if I
thought fit to give him Leave to ofser it in my
Name to the two Merchants, the Survivors of my
Trustees who liv'd in the Brasils, who must fully
understand the Value ofit, who liv'd just upon the
Spot, and who 1 knew were very rich, so that
he believed they would be fond of buying it;
he did not doubt, but 1 should make 4 or 5000
Pieces of Eight the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer
it to them, and he did so; and in about 8 Month
more, the Ship being then retum'd, he sent me an
Account, that they had accepted the Ofser, and
had remitted 33000 Pieces of Eight, to a Cor-
respondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In Return, I signed the Instrument of Sale in the
Form, which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to
my old Man, who sent me Bills of Exchange for
3 28000 Pieces of Eight to me, sor the Estate; re-
serving the Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to
him, the old Man, during his Lise, and 50 Moi-
dores afterwards to his Son tor his Lise, which I
had promis'd them, which the Plantation was to
make good as a Rent-Charge. And thus 1 have
given the first Part of a Lise ofFortune and Ad-
venture, a Lise of Providence's Checquer-Work,
and of a Variety which the World will seldom
be able to shew the like of: Beginning foolishly,
but closing much more happily than any Part of
it ever gave me Leave so much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this State of com-
plicated good Fortune, I was past running any
more Hazards; and so indeed I had been, if other
Cir-
t& ]
Circumstances had concurred, but I was inured to
a wandering Lise, had no Family, nor many Rela-
tions, nor however rich had I contracted much Ac-
quaintance; and though I had sold my Estate in
the Emsils, yet I could not keep the Country out
ot' my Head, and had a great Mind to be upon
the Wing again, especially I could not resist the
strong Inclination I had to see my Island, and to
know is the poor Spaniards were in Being there,
and how the Rogues I left there had used them.
My true Friend the Widow, earnestly diswa-
ded me from it, and so far prevail'd with me, that
tor almost seven Years she prevented my running
abroad; during which Time, I took my two
Nephews, the Children of one of my Brothers,
into my Care: The eldest having something of
his own I bred up as a Gentleman, and gave him
a Settlement of some Addition to his Estate, after
my Decease; the other I put out to a Captain of
a Ship ; and after five Years, finding him a ien-
fible, bold, enterprizing young Fellow, I put him
into a good Ship, and sent him to Sea: And this
young Fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as
I was, to farther Adventures myself.
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here;
for first os all I marry'd, and that not either to my
Disadvantage or Dissatisfaction, and had three
Children, two Sons and one Daughter: But my
Wise dying, and my Nephew coming Home with
good Success from a Voyage to Spain, my Inclina-
tion to go abroad, and his Importunity, prevailed
and engag'd me to go in his Ship, as a private Tra-
der to the Eaft-Indies: This was in the Year i<5p4-
I this Voyage I visited my 'new Colony in the
Island, saw my Successors the Spaniards, had the
whole Story of their Lives, and of the Villans I
left there, how at first they insulted the poor Spa-
niards
niards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, li-
nked, separated, and how at last the Spaniards
were oblig'd to use Violence with them, how they
were subjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the
Spaniards us'd them; a History, if it were enter'd
into, as full of Variety and wonderful Accidents,
as my own Part, particularly also as to their Bat-
tles with the Carribeans, who landed several times
upon the Island, and as to the Improvement they
made upon the Island itself, and how five of them
made an Attempt upon the main Land, and
brought away eleven Men and five Women Vxi-
soners, by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young Children on the Island.
Here I stay'd about 20 Days, left them Sup-
lies of all necessary Things, and particularly of
Arms, Powder, Shot, Cloaths, Tools, and two
Workmen, which I brought from England with
me, viz- a Carpenter and a Smith.
Besides this, I shar'd the Island into Parts with
'em, reserv'd to myself the Property of the whole,
but gave them such Parts, respectively as they a-
greed on; and having settled all Things with
them, and engaged them not to leave the Place,
I left them there.
From thence I touch'd at the Brafilsi from whence
I sent a Bark, which I bought there, with more
People to the Island, and in ic, besides other Sup-
pliesj I sent seven Women, being such as I found
proper for Service, or for Wives to such as would
take them : As to the Englijh Men, I promis'd them
to send them some Women from England, with a
good Cargo of Necessaries, if they would apply
themselves to Planting, which I afterwards per-
form'd. And the Fellows prov'd very honest
and deligent after they were master'd, aod had
their Properties set apart for them. I sent them
also from the Brafils five Cows, three of them be-
ing big with Calf, some Sheep, and some Hogs,
which, when I came again, were considerably en-
creas d.
But all these Things, with an Account how 300
CaribUsvvns and invaded them, and ruin'd their
P'antations, and how they fought with that whole
Number twice, and were at first defeared, and
three cf them kill'd; but at last a Storm destroy-
ing their Enemies Canoes, they famisti'd or de-
stroy'd almost all the rest, and renew'd and rer
coverM the Possession of their Plantation, and still
liv'd upon the llland.
All these Things, with some very surprizing In-
cidents in some new Adventures of my own, for
ten Years more, I may perhaps give a farther
Account of hear after.
