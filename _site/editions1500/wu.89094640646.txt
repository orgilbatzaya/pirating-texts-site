PREFACE
Is it possible to chart a straight course through the dense
thicket of contemporary philosophical thought, where so
many voices are crying, "Lo, here!" and "Lo, there I"? I
have long believed that it is, providing one follows a suit-
able principle of selection, and this book is an attempt to
substantiate that conviction.
Each Part of the book is practically an independent unit.
Those who have never been initiated into the mysteries of
philosophy should certainly begin with Part I. Others may
omit this entirely, or browse through it and proceed to the
exposition of the separate types in Parts II, III, and IV.
These may be read in any order the reader prefers. Or the
first chapter of each Part may be read together, and then
the second, and so on. Reading by this latter method gives
the problems approach, whereas reading each Part through
separately gives the type of philosophy approach. The fact
that the material is organized so that it may be read either
way, will, I hope, make the book more useful.
Throughout I have tried to make the exposition interest-
ing without making it superficial, and informative without
making it intolerably technical. If critics find it dull, or too
intricate and profound, I shall be disappointed, for it is
especially intended to create and instill in the reader that
love of philosophy which comes only to those who attain
some sense of mastery of the subject. Even though philos-
ophy cannot be made dead easy without ceasing to be phi-
losophy, it should be possible to make it interesting. Al-
though I have tried hard to be fair in the exposition of each
type, and to keep my own opinions out of the exposition, I
am aware that I have not entirely succeeded. Yet I trust
that critics who do not share my own philosophical creed,
vii
will appreciate the value to the student and general reader
of a survey such as I have here given.
The selections contained in my Anthology of Recent
Philosophy are arranged to parallel the chapters of this
book, and they provide adequate source-material to supple-
ment the expositions contained herein. The two books to-
gether contain a sufficient amount of material for discussion
for a year course in philosophy. The first semester may be
devoted to Orientation and one of the three main types, and
the second semester to the other two main types. The ma-
terial on Other Types may either be left until the end of the
course or be introduced wherever the teacher prefers.
The selections contained in my Anthology of Modern
Philosophy, especially those from the great philosophers of
the nineteenth century, may also be used to advantage for
supplementary reading.
Teachers will find it a good plan to assign to each student
a typical representative of each type of philosophy for a
written report, either on his philosophy as a whole or on
some aspect of it. In preparing this report the student
should be required to read extensively in the books of that
philosopher. Additional suggestions, which will be of special
interest to teachers and students, will be found at the end of
the book under the heading Suggested Supplementary
Work.
Most of Part I, Chapter II appeared under the title,
The Chief Types of Motivation to Philosophic Reflection,
in The Journal of Philosophy (Vol. XX, pp. 29-41), and I
am obliged to the editors for permission to reprint it here.
My thanks are due to my teachers, to my colleagues who
are teaching philosophy, and to my students. I am also espe-
cially indebted to Professors Carroll D. W. Hildebrand and
James Hall Pitman and to Mr. Christian Knecht, who
kindly read the manuscript and offered valuable suggestions.

ORIENTATION
Chapter I
EVERYMAN'S PHILOSOPHY
i. The Word Philosophy
THE word philosophy came into English from the
Greek language. It is a combination of the Greek
words ^iXiw, to love, and ao<t>ia, wisdom. Hence its literal
meaning is the loving_ of wisdom. The philosopher is
one who ardently loves wisdom. Tradition attributes the
origin of the Greek word for philosopher to Pythagoras,
who preferred to call himself $i\6oo<t>os, one who loves wis-
dom, instead of oo<t>k, a sage. Note that the possession of
wisdom does not make a person a philosopher but rather
the possession of a passion, an ardent longing for wisdom.
Socrates, the first martyr to philosophy, claimed that the
highest wisdom is to know that you know nothing. No
true philosopher boasts of having wisdom. Every true
philosopher humbly seeks and passionately loves it.
To a philosopher wisdom is not the same as knowledge.
Facts may be known in prodigious' numbers without the
knower of them loving wisdom. Indeed the person who
possesses encyclopedic information may actually have a gen-
uine contempt for those who love and seek wisdom. The
philosopher is not content with a mere knowledge of facts.
He desires to integrate and evaluate facts, and to probe
beneath the obvious to the deeper orderliness behind the
immediately given facts. Insight into the hidden depths of
reality, perspective on human life and nature in their en-
tirety, in the words of Plato, to be a spectator of time and
existence—these are the philosopher's objectives. Too great
3
4 ORIENTATION
an interest in the minutiae of science may, and often does,
obscure these basic objectives.
Philosophers assume that the love of wisdom is a natural
endowment of the human being. Potentially every man is
a philosopher because in the depths of his being there is an
intense longing to fathom the mysteries of existence. As
we shall presently learn, this inner yearning expresses itself
in various ways prior to any actual study of philosophy
as a technical branch of human culture. Consequently every
human being, in so far as he has ever been or is a lover of
wisdom, has, to that„extent, a philosophy of life. This is
especially true of young people who are in the process of
developing a genuine self-consciousness. During the pe-
riod called "teen-age" there is a keen interest in the pro-
founder problems both of human life and of natural exist-
ence, which fructifies in an amateup philosophy of life.
Chesterton and William James were surely right in hold-
ing that the most important thing to know about any per-
son with whom you may have dealings is his, to him often
unconscious, philosophy of life.
2. The Basic Problem of the Teacher of Philosophy
To the professional philosopher the philosophies of life
of all people who have not mastered the technicalities of the
field of philosophy are naive. This applies quite generally to
the philosophies of life of mature, educated people, as well
as to those of young men and young women. The philoso-
pher thinks that many highly educated and worldly success-
ful people are subject to naivete in philosophy. And he has
a rather contemptuous name, or set of names, for all ama-
teur speculation. He calls it naive realism, or the philosophy
of the man in the street, or the philosophy of the unphilo-
sophical, or common sense. The beginning student may per-
haps find comfort in the fact that his own philosophy of
life is only a few degrees more naive than that of a Senator
or President of the United States. Then, too, the philoso-
EVERYMAN'S PHILOSOPHY
5
pher's contempt for naive realism is really mollified by
a dash of fear that the views of the amateur may, after all,
be as near the truth as his own. This makes him frequently
overanxious to placate common sense by trying to argue
the naive person into thinking that the philosopher's views
are really the same as those held by everybody.1 Many a
thinker has been horrified by the thought that he is not
in accord with common sense, whereas many another has
been equally horrified by the suspicion that the man in the
street may be right.
Recognizing this fundamental distinction between the
philosophy of life of the man in the street and the phi-
losophy of those who have mastered the technicalities of the
subject, the teacher of philosophy is confronted with a
serious problem. How can he lead the student, from the
naive philosophy he has at the beginning of his study, over
to a comprehension of the subject as it is understood by the
professional philosopher? Here is the supreme and the
perennial problem of the teacher who would introduce
young people to what he regards as the holy of holies of
the temple of knowledge. What method can be used to
release the prisoner from the bonds of common sense, that
he may make the steep ascent to those sublime speculative
heights where he may breathe the rarefied atmosphere of
divine philosophy? This is the basic pedagogical problem
confronting the teacher.
3. Various Approaches to, Philosophy
One method is to indoctrinate the student as soon as pos-
sible with some special brand of philosophy. By this means
he may soon learn to substitute for his common sense
views the views of his teacher. This method has been rather
1 There is nothing more tragic-comic in the whole history of philosophy
than Bishop Berkeley's attempt, in the Three Dialogues Between Hylas and
Phiionous, to prove that the gardener, to whom the naive Hylas and the
idealistic Phiionous both appealed, really looked on the world as did the
good Bishop himself. Yet this attempt has been ofttimes repeated in the dis-
cussions of philosophers.
6
ORIENTATION
widely used. Perhaps it has a value for students who have
neither the inclination nor the leisure to devote themselves
permanently to philosophy, but who need to have their
minds settled before they enter professional life. There is
unquestionably a great deal of this type of instruction in phi-
losophy in American colleges today, and by no means all of
it is confined to class-rooms in philosophy. This method is
too often used by naive philosophers, who are supposed to
be teaching other subjects, to indoctrinate the student with
views that are slightly less naive than those the student
already has. This method never produces a philosopher.
It may, and often does, produce considerable pompous
conceit. It often makes cads in philosophy. It is almost cer-
tain to close the mind of the student to the realm of phi-
losophy, because it stills the disinterested passion for wis-
dom into a peaceful slumber of acquiescence in the views
of some school or person. All of the great problems of
philosophy are solved for the student by a distinguished
authority. His own thinking is unnecessary. All he needs
to do is to learn the jargon of the particular school in
which he is being indoctrinated. How dare he speak, or
even think, on a problem which has already been correctly
answered? Let him content himself with learning the an-
swer 1 However important learning the answer may be, no
student will become a philosopher until he learns to think
as an independent solver of problems, and those who re-
sort to the method of indoctrination always fear that kind
of thinking.
Another method is to take the student through a rapid
survey of all the systems of philosophy in their historical
sequence. This is undoubtedly much better than indoctrina-
tion in the tenets of some one school. Sooner or later a
philosopher will have to learn the history of philosophy.
Contemporary philosophies cannot be adequately under-
stood by one who is entirely ignorant of this history. Per-
haps those institutions which require of all students a be-
7
ginning course in the history of philosophy, as a prerequisite
to any other course in philosophy, are pursuing the wisest
policy. The chief danger in such a survey course is that the
student will get only a smattering of the various systems,
with very little comprehension of what philosophy is.
When the course in the history of philosophy has this
effect, the method is bad. But it need not have this effect
if the student is serious, alert, and willing to work, and the
teacher a real philosopher, and not a pedant with an axe
to grind in the form of a philosophy of his own he is trying
to inculcate.
A third approach is to bring out the relation of phi-
losophy to the other aspects of culture with which the stu-
dent is presumably more familiar. Those who use this
method elaborate on the similarities and differences be-
tween science and philosophy, or between religion and phi-
losophy, or between art and philosophy. Teachers favoring
this method frequently develop introductory courses in the
philosophy of science, or the philosophy of religion, or
aesthetics, instead of a general course in the introduction to
philosophy. This method also has great value. It is ex-
tremely important that the student get an idea at the outset
of the similarities and differences between philosophy and
other aspects of culture. The danger here is that the student
will come to think that these peripheral parts of philoso-
phy constitute philosophy, and that all philosophy is simply
a general interpretation of science, or of art, or of reli-
gion. A philosophy which is departmental in its basis and
ouddok is likely to result. Such a philosophy ignores the
central problems, and falls short of that total interpreta-
tion of all aspects of culture which constitutes the heart of
philosophy. (For a fourth approach see Chapter V.)
4. Everyman's Philosophy
Let us return to the philosophy of the unphilosophical
and attempt to understand it. For the chief defect in all of
8
ORIENTATION
these other approaches to philosophy is that they do not
give any attention at the outset to the student's own phi-
losophy. Surely this is important, for this is the philosophy
of such a large number of human beings, and precisely of
those who aspire to know technical philosophy. Let us not
be contemptuous of it, but rather let us give it a dignified
name and attempt to indicate what it is. Perhaps the best
introduction one can get to philosophy is to become con-
scious to the fullest possible extent of the philosophy he has
when he begins the serious study of the subject. Since this
philosophy is shared by many, let us call it Everyman's
Philosophy. What is it?
In trying to answer this question the philosopher is con-
fronted with a peculiar difficulty. He has been so long a
student of technical philosophy that he is almost certain to
give a prejudiced statement of Everyman's Philosophy.
Then, too, he may use technical language which Mr. Every-
man himself cannot understand. The way out of this diffi-
culty would seem to be to let Mr. Everyman state it him-
self. But he is not a philosopher and does not know very
well what his philosophy is, just because he does not know
what the word philosophy means. Perhaps this explains
why philosophers have been so prone to use some other ap-
proach. For here is a genuinely paradoxical situation. The
philosopher cannot fairly expound Everyman's Philosophy
because he is too much of a philosopher, and Mr. Every-
man cannot tell what his own philosophy is because he is
too ignorant of philosophy. Can we escape this paradox?
One way to escape it is to search, and to have the student
search, for the sources of Everyman's Philosophy. Is there,
as was suggested above, any craving, rooted deep in human
nature, to which the teacher can point the student as the
real fountain-head of his and of Everyman's Philosophy?
What are the experiences of childhood and early youth
which lie at the bottom of the philosophy of life students
have when they begin a course in technical philosophy?
9
What are the beliefs they have accepted from parents,
teachers, and associates as the guiding principles of their
lives? Is Everyman's Philosophy rooted in individual ex-
periences? Is it merely the expression of the civilization
and the social environment in which he was reared and is
now immersed? Or should both factors be taken into ac-
count? These are the questions the answers to which might
bring to light something of the nature of Everyman's
Philosophy.
Professor Hoernle writes: "There is a deep-seated need
in the human mind, the roots of which strike far beneath all
other needs and interests. This is the need to feel at home
in the universe. From this source spring all philosophies." 3
Many other philosophers have expressed a similar idea. If
it is true, then every student should be able to find, by pro-
found reflection on his own nature, this ultimate spring of
Everyman's Philosophy. Do you personally feel this need to
be at home in the universe? Do you have an itching curios-
ity to know why you are living and what the world is which
surrounds you? Do you feel any deep urge to explain, or
to find out how others have explained, the ultimate signifi-
cance of human life as a whole, and of the physical world
in which human life is rooted? Locate such feelings in your-
self and become conscious of them, and you will discover
at least one of the primary sources, not only of Everyman's
Philosophy, but of all technical philosophy as well. For all
the great systems of philosophy, living and dead (if, in-
deed, any of them have ever died) are but the streams that
have trickled from the inexhaustible fountain of the human
spirit.
Think, too, of the various experiences of your childhood
and youth in which you were provoked to reflection on any
of the mysteries of existence. Josiah Royce, one of the ablest
teachers of philosophy this country has produced, used to
ask his students at Harvard to write up detailed accounts
•R. F. A. Hoernli: Idealism as a Philosophy, p. 23 (R. C. Smith, Inc.).
IO
ORIENTATION
of experiences of this sort. He then used these accounts as
a starting point for his philosophical discussions. His
method was sound just because every life is enriched with
experiences which cry out for philosophical interpretation
until they get it. Every youth has had such experiences.
Some intimate friend or close relative came to a tragic end;
or a great danger was suddenly faced; or some community-
stirring event happened where you lived; or you dreamed an
unforgettable dream; or plumbed to the depths some major
passion like anger, revenge, or love; or you came under the
influence of a magnetic and inexplicable personality; or you
read a gripping story, or saw a powerful play; or you felt
for the first time the presence of beauty or God or felt
remorse over having drained some of the dregs of life.
Such experiences drive men to thought far oftener than to
drink or to suicide.
Such are the experiences which generate the thinking at
the basis of Everyman's Philosophy. Even one crucial ex-
perience may initiate a philosophy of life. Mr. Everyman
will talk it over with his friends. He will read widely to
find an answer to the questions to which it gives rise. By
so doing he forms fixed ideas, prejudices, and beliefs. These
become essential ingredients in his philosophy. Only Mr.
Everyman does not know this. He has not yet learned that
"the act of thought by which we believe a thing is different
from that by which we know that we believe it" (Des-
cartes). Once he learns this he will know that he is a
philosopher.
In his able address at the Sixth International Congress
of Philosophy, as well as in his essay on philosophy in
Whither Mankind, Professor John Dewey has rightly
stressed the significance of the general social life and cul-
ture of a people in the development of their philosophy.
Indeed, he would define philosophy as a civilization becom-
ing conscious of its ideals and aspirations. Whatever one
may think of Professor Dewey's idea of the connection be-
11
tween philosophy and civilization, it at least suggests an-
other highly important source of Everyman's Philosophy.
For if social environment conditions the growth of techni-
cal systems of philosophy, it is even more powerful in creat-
ing the stock of ideas which make up Everyman's Phi-
losophy, since this philosophy is the unconscious absorption
of all sorts of ideas and opinions from every conceivable
source. The process begins in the cradle, and it ends only
with death. Mr. Everyman inevitably fits whatever he reads
or hears or experiences in any other way into this set of
opinions and fixed ideas which has been gradually accumu-
lated. (Hence Everyman's Philosophy is a more or less
ordered set of unexamined premises and assumed truths,
partly obtained by reflecting upon the significant experi-
ences of life and partly absorbed from the social environ-
ment. It is the sum-total of all the prejudices, superstitions,
maxims, hasty generalizations, proverbs, ideals and aspira-
tions which actually operate in an individual's reactions to
the situations of everyday life. It is continually being modi-
fied, especially in young minds. What is believed today may
be rejected tomorrow, but the new belief which replaces
it will be as dogmatically proclaimed tomorrow as was the
old yesterday. Such is the general character of Everyman's
Philosophy.
5. The Relation of Technical Philosophy to
Everyman's Philosophy
Technical philosophy differs from Everyman's Philoso-
phy in the first place by being critical. It assumes as a
methodological principle that the beliefs of Mr. Everyman
need to be systematically examined. They must be traced to
their various origins, and the original experiences which they
were devised to explain must be studied. Their grounds or
evidences must be sought. Why is each one held? Is it justi-
fiable? By this critical attitude philosophy encourages doubt.
But it is a "motivated doubt"—a doubting for the sake of
12
ORIENTATION
finding whether there are any beliefs which can survive
the critical activity of the doubter. Technical terms are in-
vented, beliefs are rearranged according to some principle,
and the outcome is a technical philosophy.
Many philosophers never get beyond the purely critical
attitude. They become so enamored by this task of examin-
ing popular beliefs, with the idea of rejecting them, that
they reach the one moving dubiety that there is no well
grounded belief. This is scepticism. It characterizes many
philosophers of the present day. Indeed, such a position
is the besetting sin against which the lover of wisdom must
be forever on his guard. For to take this position is to re-
ject the basic idea of "motivated doubt" and to make
doubting the be-all and end-all of philosophizing. The phi-
losopher thus turns cynical and sits in the scorner's seat,
proud and puffed up over his ability to pick flaws in the
beliefs of the man in the street. But he has no philosophy
to offer. The sceptic is a pitcher broken at the fountain.
Yet scepticism in the complete and thorough-going form
of doubting absolutely everything is really the starting
point of technical philosophy. No student will ever under-
stand any of the great systems of philosophy, or appreciate
the thinking of any first class philosopher, who is afraid of
scepticism. Be a sceptic, only be one consistently. Give up all
of your beliefs which will not stand criticism, those of
science as well as those of religion. This must be the advice
of every philosopher to the youth who wants to be a
philosopher. Above the gateway to this temple of wisdom
there is carved the motto: "Let none enter here concealing
prejudices!"
It must be conceded that none of the philosophers of the
first rank have remained permanently in scepticism. With
the possible exception of David Hume, every supremely
great thinker has gone beyond this type of thought to a set
of grounded beliefs from which he has built up a coherent
scheme of ideas. At the same time he has bowed before

13
the ultimate mysteries with a sense of humility. The phi-
losophies which result when criticism yields fruitful beliefs
from which further significant deductions can be made may
be called systems of speculative philosophy, to distinguish
them from scepticism, or purely critical philosophy. Thus
technical philosophy has two tasks set for it by the body
of unexamined beliefs which constitute Everyman's Phi-
losophy. One is the critical and the other is the constructive
or speculative task. If the philosopher gives up the latter as
impossible, he becomes a sceptic. If he follows up his exer-
cise of the critical attitude by stating and developing the
consequences of a new set of examined and substantiated be-
liefs, to take the place of the unexamined ones constituting
Everyman's Philosophy, he becomes a speculative phi-
losopher.
However, it should be pointed out that there is a hybrid
type of philosopher, produced by combining a radical scep-
ticism with respect to the beliefs of religion and everyday
life and the ultimate mysteries with which speculative phi-
losophy deals, with a dogmatic acceptance of the teachings
of science, which is called by such thinkers positive knowl-
edge. Consequently such philosophers have come to be
known as positivists. But they are also called agnostics be-
cause they profess ignorance of, or proclaim the unknowa-
bility of, ultimate reality. During the last fifty years agnos-
ticisms and positivisms have been among the most
fashionable of philosophies.8 From the viewpoint of the
speculative philosopher these philosophies are practically
on a level with Fvpryman's Philosophy, for they rest on an
uncritical acceptance of the beliefs of science. They exag-
gerate the importance of human scientific knowledge in
comparison with other aspects of human endeavor. That is
why every teacher of philosophy insists that the student be
* Positivism is the name of the philosophy founded by the French philoso-
pher, Auguste Comte. Herbert Spencer is the leading defender of agnosticism.

Philosophy.
a sceptic to the very end, if he would become a philoso-
pher. When his scepticism is not thorough-going, he falls an
easy prey to agnosticism. The cure for agnosticism is more
scepticism, but the cure for scepticism is deeper reflection
and profounder insight.
WHY MEN PHILOSOPHIZE
i. Complexity of Human Motivation
HAVING explained the general nature of Everyman's
Philosophy and its relation to technical philosophy,
we may now turn to a consideration of the chief types of
motivation which lead people to devote their lives to philo-
sophic reflection.
That all human motivation is highly complicated and
curiously mixed is a fundamental and generally accepted
truth. The noblest deed may be, and often is, the conse-
quence of a chain of motives some of the links of which are
prosaic and commonplace, if not even sordid. Nor need a
person be a student of criminology to know that many a
crime is the result of an entanglement of motives some of
which are really praiseworthy. The good and the bad acts
which men do are both made out of the same stuff: they
flow forth from that common fountain-head of mental life
—the undifferentiated emotional, instinctive, and sensa-
tional congeries which constitutes what, for want of a better
name, may be called the momentary active self.
This well-known fact puts a special limitation on any
attempt to isolate and to analyze the motivation which
leads a particular human being to devote himself to the life
of philosophic reflection. Indeed the problem here is even
more insoluble than in the case of a single act, for the life
of philosophic reflection is a highly involved set of activities
comprising many single acts. And if it is difficult to unravel
the complicated motivation behind a single act, it is a
fortiori far more difficult to separate out the diverse ele-
15

ments entering into the motivating process which sustains
through the years the career of a philosopher. In fact it
must be frankly admitted that the greatness of the difficulty
makes the task practically impossible so far as any indi-
vidual philosopher is concerned. And since every philoso-
pher knows full well that he does not sufficiently under-
stand himself to trace out in detail the thread of motiva-
tion which sustains him in that life, he could hardly be so
presumptuous as to claim to be able to analyze that which
is behind the reflective activity of another. Instead of men
choosing philosophy it often seems that philosophy is a
great over-individual which chooses certain human beings
to voice its message and to articulate its insights. That these
men are motivated in their philosophizing we cannot ques-
tion, but we must also admit that the motivation is too liv-
ing and intricate for anyone to analyze sufficiently well to
be able to say: "This man was motivated by this and that
man by that." The truth is that the motivation of every
real philosopher is compounded out of both this and that,
and the more human and genuine the philosopher the more
labyrinthine his motivation.
Nevertheless, every student of the history of philosophy
must recognize the existence of distinct types of motivation,
even though it is impossible to say that any particular
thinker was guided by one rather than, or to the exclusion
of, any other. We are here concerned with these dominant
types of motivation, and we are restating the sources of
Everyman's Philosophy as they appear at the level of philo-
sophic reflection.
2. The Hedonic Type of Motivation
A great philosopher, one who has made important con-
tributions to philosophy and who is quite generally re-
spected for his intellectual ability, once said to me that he
could not accept any of the existing systems of philosophy
(we were talking especially of idealism), because to do so
WHY MEN PHILOSOPHIZE
17
would mean that the gates of all further speculation would
be closed, philosophizing would resolve itself into rethink-
ing what other men have already thought, and consequently
there would be no fun in it. This suggests what I mean by
the hedonic motivation.1 It is philosophizing for the fun
there is in it or building up a speculative system in order to
have something interesting to do. From this point of view a
philosophical Weltanschauung is an imposing toy, con-
structed by the human intellect to satisfy a kind of play
instinct or fun-loving disposition. And naturally there is
more fun in fabricating your own toy than in playing with
one someone else has constructed. Just as many find en-
joyment playing a parlor or an outdoor game, so the phi-
losopher, having fallen in love with dialectical subtleties,
finds an unadulterated mental pleasure in playing the one-
man game of juggling intellectual abstractions.
Josiah Royce gave fitting and beautiful expression to this
type of motivation when, concerning the joy that philo-
sophical students take in the reflective life, he wrote: "Let
me admit frankly: it is indeed the joy, if you like, of play-
ing cat and mouse with your dearest other self. It is even
somewhat like the joy, if so you choose to declare, which
infants take in that primitive form of hide and seek that
is suited to their months. 'Where is my truth, my life, my
faith, my temperament?' says the philosopher. And if,
some volumes further on in the exposition of his system,
he says, 'Oh I there it is,' the healthy babies will be on his
side in declaring that such reflections are not wholly with-
out their rational value. But why do I thus apparently
degrade speculation by again deliberately comparing it with
a game? Because, I answer, in one sense, all consciousness
is a game, a series of longings and of reflections which it is
easy to call superfluous if witnessed from without. The
justification of consciousness is the having of it. And this
1 Hedonism is the technical term used by philosophers to name the eth-
icil theory that pleasure is the highest good.
ORIENTATION
magnificent play of the spirit with itself, this infantile love
of rewinning its own wealth ever anew through deliberate
loss, through seeking, and through joyous recognition, what
is this, indeed, but the pastime of the divine life itself?"2
For a melancholic temperament this type of motivation
will inevitably take on a more sombre hue. In fact it seems
to be able to fructify equally well in an extreme and shal-
low optimism or in a thoroughgoing and dismal pessimism.
Whether one holds philosophizing to be a form of pleasure
among many, no one of which is more ultimate than an-
other, or the only vocation capable of producing a durable
satisfaction; or whether he holds the world to be wholly
and radically evil and philosophy a kind of negative good in
that it may alleviate to a certain extent the dreadful misery
of existence; or whether he holds some view in between
these extremes, this type of motivation is in any case active.
It underlies Epicureanism and Stoicism and some forms of
Scepticism. Wherever and whenever men turn to philoso-
phy as a kind of mental paradise or city of refuge, situated
within the domains of a veritable hell, this type of motiva-
tion is in evidence.
In Paradise Lost there is an excellent illustration of the
extreme pessimistic form of this type of motivation. Mil-
ton is describing the various occupations of the devils in
the nether regions during the interim while Satan is absent
on his journey to earth to beguile man. And it is with
genuine respect that he writes of a certain group of imps
who turned to philosophizing in order to mitigate their
torments:
Others apart sat on a hill retired,
In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate;
Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,
And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.
Of good and evil much they argued then,

Of happiness and final misery,
Passion and apathy, and glory and shame,
Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!—
Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite
Fallacious hope, or arm the obdured breast
With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
Is there not here a fairly accurate poetic description of
the hedonic motivation to philosophic reflection? Nor is it
so very far from this to the ideas expressed in Bertrand
Russell's much-quoted and justly praised Free Man's Wor-
ship. Only for Russell men are in much the same position
as the Miltonian devils. Confronted with the indubitable
scientific knowledge that mankind is foredoomed to de-
struction, individually and collectively, thinking men may
yet find freedom, and therewith a certain grim resignation
in the contemplation of the awful impending catastrophe.
Even though he knows with absolute certainty that physical
processes are at work which will utterly efface from the uni-
verse, not only all man's manifold works, but man himself
as a spectator of the cosmic drama, nevertheless, in phi-
losophy the individual thinker may find a light that will
illumine his little day. Substitute for the devils of Milton
Russell's free men, and the poet's account of the motivation
to philosophic reflection in hell may be transferred back to
earth, for it goes without saying that Milton's portrayal
was anthropomorphic.
The fact that the devil philosophers and free men are
hedonically motivated should not be taken as a complete
disparagement of this type of motivation. For there is a
sense in which every philosopher is a devil philosopher as
well as a free man. Some of the noblest and keenest think-
ers in philosophy's Hall of Fame entered through this por-
tal. Forasmuch as philosophy offers to men an interesting
and pleasurable form of intellectual activity, one which is
capable of calling forth the very best in human nature, and
since in philosophy men can somehow find a balm for sor-
row, an assuagement for grief, a relief, however momen-
tary, from torment—yes, thanks to the fact that there is
fun in philosophizing—it follows that every true philoso-
pher can and should rejoice that the subject he loves is not
wholly devoid of practical value.
And yet he whose quest for metaphysical truth is im-
pelled by this type of motivation must be forever on his
guard. Here lurk the subtle dangers against which Francis
Bacon warned in his famous idols.8 Actuated by this motive
we may build a neat system which is not in accord with
reality, because, forsooth, an ordered and systematic
world is more pleasing than a chaotic one. Or, sharing
Russell's preference for a philosophy which has something
of the character of a hair shirt, perhaps we may be in dan-
ger of making the world out to be a great deal worse than
it actually is. How often have the speculations of philoso-
phers been condemned as arbitrary constructions, fantastic
play or dream-worlds, idola theatri! And if too frequently
the charge has been true, it has sometimes been due to the
fact that certain systems are the results of an excessive
hedonic motivation. And I, for one, am glad that Royce
corrected his too great emphasis on philosophy as play
with the statement: "I confess to you that, although I my-
self often take a certain personal delight in the mere sub-
tleties of speculation, although I also enjoy at times that
miserliness which makes the professional student hoard up
the jewels of reflection for the sake of gloating over their
mere hardness and glitter, I find always that when I come
to think of the thing fairly, there is, after all, no beauty in
a metaphysical system which does not spring from its value
as a record of a spiritual experience." 4 The hedonic motiva-
tion is peripheral and anthropocentric. It will not, because
it cannot, take one into the heart of reality. It stands con-

demned for its insufficiency and for sacrificing philosophy on
the altar of pleasure.
3. The Theological Type of Motivation
Philosophy presupposes a relatively high state of civili-
zation. It cannot come into existence until a people has
first developed a literature, a legal code, and a religious
liturgy and dogma. This means that it follows, both logi-
cally and temporally, the development of social, moral, and
religious customs and manners, creeds and beliefs. Because
men are necessarily deeply rooted in a highly cultured en-
vironment before they begin philosophic reflection, all the
ideas which are characteristic of that environment have
entered into the making of the mind of the thinker long
before he becomes a philosopher in the technical sense of
the word.
Now in many minds it is precisely the religious ideas
peculiar to the civilization in question which exercise the
dominant role during the years preceding the rise of re-
flective self-analysis and speculative thought. And to begin
with beliefs about religion which are dogmatically and un-
critically asserted as eternal truths, and then to engage
Jn the kind of arbitrary speculation which will harmonize
and substantiate'these beliefs without first subjecting the
beliefs themselves to critical analysis, is what I mean by
being ttTeoTo~g1cally motivated to philosophic ~reHectTon.
There are numerous illustrations of this type of motivation
in the history of philosophy. The stock illustration is Medi-
aeval Scholasticism, but Neo-Scholasticism and much
Protestant Christian Philosophy is permeated by the same
type of motivation. Accepting the religious ideas current in
one's own environment as unassailable truths, and working
out a philosophical doctrine or system which will justify
them, is philosophizing prompted by this theological type
of motivation, be the thinker Mohammedan or Confucian,
Jew or Gentile, Catholic or Protestant.
I hasten to add, however, that this does not mean that
every theistic philosophy is theologically motivated. This is
a radically mistaken inference which is too frequently put
forward as a basic truism. A theistic philosophy is not theo-
logically motivated when it is the result and an expression
of a thinker's deepest and sincerest thought about the prob-
lems of philosophy, and represents his acutest insight into
the nature of things. It is theologically motivated only when
it is adopted at the very beginning of reflection as a dog-
matic assumption. As Santayana has well remarked, Royce
was a "person with no very distinctive Christian belief." 5
Nevertheless, he reached a philosophical position which he
deliberately called theistic, and which would generally be
regarded as true to the spirit of Christian philosophy. And
yet Royce could hardly be charged with being theologically
motivated.
Nor does this mean, as is too often implied, that every
theologically motivated system of thought or philosophic
creed is theistic, or even' friendly to religion. There are
negative as well as positive religious beliefs. There are
highly intellectual environments in the modern world in
which philosophic minds are germinating that are through
and through anti-religious. There is an atheistic as well as
a theistic dogma. Whoever philosophizes in order to dis-
prove a religious conception of the world is just as much
theologically motivated as he who philosophizes in order to
establish such an interpretation. "Religion is a dangerous
superstition which ought to be stamped out," are the words
of a young graduate student in philosophy. Here is the
negative type of theological motivation at work. And it
is always at work in the thinking of those philosophers who
regard it as the unique task and bounden duty of philosophy
to uproot religion.
What, now, is to be thought of the theological type of
8 George Santayana: Winds of Doctrine, p. 189 (Scribners). But see San-
tayana's criticism of Royce below, pp. 143 f.
23
motivation? It is logically dependent upon the hedonic type
and consequently shares its weakness. If the religious be-
liefs of men are not philosophically defensible, human hap-
piness is impossible; therefore philosophy must by all means
justify them—so argue those who are motivated by the
positive form of theological motivation. If the religious
beliefs of men are justifiable, human happiness is impos-
sible; therefore it is the business of philosophy to make
away with these absurd superstitions—so argue those who
are motivated by the negative form of theological motiva-
tion. And the cynic might make a perfect simple destruc-
tive dilemma. If human happiness is possible, either re-
ligious beliefs must be proved true or they must be proved
false, but they can neither be proved true nor false, ergo
human happiness is impossible. Admit that the cynic is
right and the theological type of motivation resolves into
the negative hedonic type. Thus, either in its positive or
negative form, the hedonic type of motivation is really the
tap-root of the theological type. Consequently, the latter
is just as anthropocentric and peripheral as the former.
It, too, sacrifices philosophy on the altar of personal satis-
faction.
Moreover, it is a contradiction for a philosopher to with-
hold any of his beliefs from the crucible of rigorous
thought. The belief that there is a God, and all other
religious beliefs, must be thrown in with all the rest of the
equipage of naive realism. But so also must the belief that
there is no God. Anti-religious or naturalistic dogmatism
is just as reprehensible as religious dogmatism, just as in-
tolerant and dangerous, too. The ideal of a philosopher is
to start de novo, without a prejudice to nurse or an axe
to grind.
And yet the theological type of motivation has its good
fruits. Here, too, is one of the fairest and most attractive of
the approaches to philosophy. Many a student has made his
way into the profoundest depths of metaphysical truth be-
34

cause of a zeal to establish impregnably his religious views.
And, on the other hand, philosophy could ill afford to lose
the stimulus of its Nietzsches. Whoever condemns the
theological type of motivation without reservation proves
himself ignorant of its potential power to create new and
valuable philosophical interpretations. But while no true
philosopher can afford to ignore the thought-systems which
theologically motivated thinkers have given to the world,
there is, I think, a more excellent entrance into the domain
of philosophy.
4. The Sociological Type of Motivation
However, before taking up this more excellent type of
motivation, it is first necessary to deal with another which
is sometimes mistakenly identified with it. This is the socio-
logical type of motivation, and in expounding it let us expose
the fallacy of treating it as being equivalent to the scientific
type.
There is a theory abroad that our whole social structure
is a product of a haphazard and irrational growth, and is
therefore ipso facto radically wrong. Owing to the fact that
science (which is assumed to be a synonym for rationality)
is a comparatively new development, or at least has only
in our day reached its full fruition in a science of society,
little or no rationality is supposed to have been at work in
the processes which produced the various institutions and
ideals, customs and laws which constitute the very essence
of our modern civilization. Consequently, the real business
of modern men, who, just because they are modern,
must be alive to the existing chaotic social, industrial,
and international situation, is to create, on the foundation
of modern physical and chemical science and under the
immediate direction of modern social and political science,
a rational social order to supplant the existing irrational
order. The present order is held to be all out of joint be-
cause it is based on the principle: "Every man for himself
*5
and the devil take the hindermost." Let us apply our scien-
tific knowledge to the task of making a better world, based
on the principle of satisfying the largest possible number
of desires or interests.
The world is out of joint. O cursed spite
That ever I was born to set it right,—
Shakespeare has Hamlet say, but, admitting the truth of
the premise, many men today would say: O blessed privilege
that modern man was born to set it right. And since the
sick world is to be healed by an application to it of the
poultice of modern scientific knowledge, which presumably
is the only remedy capable of drawing out the rottenness
and corruption, this type of thought does a prodigious
amount of talking about science and scientific method—so
much, indeed, that a novice could easily be deceived into
thinking that it must be a scientifically motivated phi-
losophy.
Now whoever accepts this current theory as an indubi-
table truism, and indulges in philosophic reflection for the
express purpose of constructing a philosophy which will sup-
port it, is sociologically motivated. That it is not really
scientifically motivated is shown by the fact that it says
that the old problems which arose when men philosophized
from a disinterested desire to know what the world actually
is—the problem of the one and the many, of change and
permanence, of mechanism and teleology, of form and mat-
ter, et cetera—are all obsolete. It holds that any philosophy
built up in the attempt to answer such questions thereby
proves its inadequacy and antiquatedness.
Who does not rejoice over the progress made in mod-
ern social and political science? Who does not freely admit
that there are glaring imperfections in the present social
order? Who does not sympathize with the helpless poor,
the suffering widows, the homeless orphans, the aged and
infirm, the nameless and numberless starving refugees in-
ORIENTATION
habiting the earth today? But why should all this cause
anyone to surrender himself to the vain hope that in this
temporal span of events a stage may be reached, through
the instrumentality of human manipulation of the vast cos-
mic mechanism, in which there will no longer be any poor,
sorrowing, and suffering mortals, and that when such a
stage is reached it can be permanently sustained and con-
tinually bettered (!) by the intellectual activity of the new
humanity which is constantly being born to enjoy it? Here,
surely, is a philosophy of life which no deeply profound
philosopher could ever hold. To adopt it is to admit that
the real world is past finding out and to withdraw clamor-
ingly into a realm of fantastic dreams. Santayana has said
that theologically motivated philosophy is "in the region
of dramatic system-making and myth to which probabili-
ties are irrelevant." But he recognizes that it is no whit
more so than a sociologically motivated philosophy. "If one
man says the moon is sister to the sun, and another says
that she is his daughter, the question is not which notion
is more probable, but whether either of them is at all ex-
pressive. The so-called evidences are devised afterwards,
when faith and imagination have prejudged the issue." 6
5. The Scientific Type of Motivation
I said above that a disinterested desire to know what
the world is originally brought to light the great problems
of philosophy. And this purely disinterested desire to pene-
trate to the inmost essence of reality I call the scientific
motivation to philosophic reflection because precisely the
same motivation actuates a theoretical scientist in carrying
on his special experimental investigations. Every student of
philosophy knows that science and philosophy originally
arose together and that the special sciences only gradually
split off from philosophy as human knowledge increased.
Consequently, philosophy is rightly named "The Mother
6 Loco citato, p. 210.

27
of the Sciences." Whatever the differences between phi-
losophy and science—and differences there certainly are—
this fact that both arose together suggests that the proper
motivation to philosophic reflection is the same as the mo-
tivation to science. And that is simply a disinterested and
insatiable desire to know all there is to be known.
Plato and Aristotle both understood this. After enu-
merating to Theaetetus some of the most abstruse and tech-
nical questions of philosophy, Plato has Socrates say:
"I suspect that you have thought of these questions be-
fore now."
"Yes, Socrates, and I am amazed when I think of them;
by the Gods I am! and I want to know what on earth they
mean; and there are times when my head quite swims with
the contemplation of them."
"I see, my dear Theaetetus, that Theodorus had a true
insight into your nature when he said that you were a
philosopher, for wonder is the feeling of a philosopher,
and philosophy begins in wonder." 7
And Aristotle probably had this passage in mind when
he wrote: "It was owing to wonder that men began to
philosophize in earlier times just as it is today, wonder-
ing at first about the problems that lie close at hand, and
then little by little advancing to the greater perplexities.
... But one who is perplexed and filled with wonder feels
himself to be in ignorance. . . . And so if men philoso-
phized in order to escape ignorance it is evident that they
pursued wisdom just for the sake of knowing, not for the
sake of any advantage it might bring. This is shown too
by the course of events. For it was only after practically
all things that are necessary for the comfort and conveni-
ence of life had been provided that this kind of knowledge
began to be sought. Clearly then we pursue this knowledge
for the sake of no extraneous use to which it may be put." 3

'Met., I. 2, 982 b 12. Translation from Bakewell's Sourcebook in Ancient
thihitphy, p. 217 (Scribners).
ORIENTATION
Now it must be admitted that the satisfying of this de-
sire to know just for the sake of knowing carries with it a
high degree of pleasurable experience. Consequently, it is
very easy to confuse the scientific type of motivation with
the hedonic. But we are here confronted with the famous
paradox of hedonism. If we desire to know for_lhe_ sake
of the pleasure it gives, we are not likely to get the real
pleasure accompanying the cognitive experience. It is only
when we desire to know just for the sake of knowing that
we can reasonably expect the desire to be satisfied. For any
ulterior motive whatsoever is apt to get in the way of the
fact, so that instead of knowing what reality is as a matter
of fact, we only take it to be what it pleases us for it to be.
And this criticism is applicable even to such a saying as
Paulsen's: "The ultimate motive impelling men to meditate
upon the nature of the universe will always be the desire
to reach some conclusion concerning the meaning, the source
and the goal of their own lives. The origin and end of
all philosophy is consequently to be sought in ethics."9
Knowledge for the sake of knowledge is the only adequate
and worthy motivation to philosophic reflection, and this is
the scientific motivation. The philosopher is one who, like
Thestetus, wants to know what on earth the answers to
philosophical questions are. He is one whose head at times
quite swims with the contemplation of such questions. But
this does not mean that he deliberately contemplates such
questions for the sake of getting mentally drunk. It is be-
cause he is simply built that way. As long as man is man,
burning by nature with insatiable curiosity, there will be in-
dividuals who will devote themselves to philosophy even
though they find there no special pleasure or relief from
pain, even though theological dogmas lose completely their
appeal, even though trying to make a better world seems

utterly futile. As long as the actual world looms awful and
mysterious above the mind of man, philosophy will nobly
flourish. For, being by nature intelligent, man cannot rest
until his mind has pierced the veil.
HOW TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY
i. The Technical Vocabulary of Philosophy
THERE are certain peculiarities about the technical
vocabulary of philosophy against which the begin-
ning student should be forewarned. These peculiarities
may be brought to light by distinguishing the chief types of
technical terms with special reference to their origin.
(A) Common Words Used in a Technical Sense. Phi-
losophers are in the habit of adapting common ordinary
words into bearers of highly technical meanings. Or they
may combine two or more ordinary words into a phrase
having a special connotation in philosophy which the un-
initiated would never suspect. Or they may differentiate
several nuances of meaning of some word which is usually
supposed to be unambiguous. These three distinct ways of
dealing with the ordinary common words of our language,
or of any language, are especially confusing to the student,
because he reads the words to mean what he has learned
them to mean from general usage, and thereby misses what
the philosopher really intends them to convey. This creates
the illusory experience of thinking that the writer's meaning
is perfectly clear, whereas, as a matter of fact, the deeper
insights are entirely beyond the student's ken. Every teacher
of philosophy is familiar with the experience of having a
student say that he understood an assignment in philoso-
phy, only to find that the essential ideas in the reading were
never even grasped. One or two examples of each of these
ways of using ordinary terms as bearers of entirely new
30
HOW TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY 31
meanings may help to put the beginner on his guard against
this particular self-deception.
Every person with an elementary education supposes that
he knows what the word event means. He has studied his-
torical events from childhood, and he naturally associates
the word event with the important occurrences in human
history, such as the signing of the Armistice or Lindbergh's
flight to Paris. Or he may think of some important occur-
rence in nature, such as an eclipse of the sun or a volcanic
eruption, as an event. Or he may think of some social
affair, such as the junior prom, or of some athletic meet as
an event. In ordinary life we use this word to refer to hap-
penings in history, in social life, and in nature. But let the
student read Dr. Whitehead's Enquiry Concerning the
Principles of Natural Knowledge, in which the term event
occurs over and over again in a highly technical sense, and
he will find it well-nigh impossible after weeks of study to
comprehend what that distinguished philosopher means
by this little and ordinary word. Special articles have been
written by students of Dr. Whitehead's writings discussing
what he means by an event.1 It is doubtful whether some
teachers of philosophy have a very clear idea of what he
means by this term. Indeed, it is even doubtful whether
he himself knows fully what he intends it to convey. For it
implies his whole philosophy, and to know what he means
by it one must have fully mastered this extremely difficult
and intricate philosophy. Moreover, this philosophy is still
in a fluid condition. Dr. Whitehead is changing the conno-
tation of the word event as his philosophy develops. Con-
sequently even he himself does not know all that this word
may come to mean in his philosophy. Numerous other illus-
trations of this fact could be given from the writings of
contemporaries as well as from those of the great philoso-

ORIENTATION
phers of the past. One of the main problems of the student
is to discover what ordinary terms are used in a special
technical sense by a given philosopher. He must also note
that philosophers of other schools may not use the par-
ticular term always in this technical sense, but only when
they are referring to the teachings of the philosopher who
invented the special meaning. In other contexts they may
use the word in its ordinary signification, or they may even
give it some technical meaning of their own that is quite
different from the usage of the other philosopher. Every
type of philosophy has its special technical terminology, not
employed by philosophers of other schools except when
they are referring to the views of their opponents. This
fact alone has caused many a student to become disgusted
with the study of philosophy and to condemn the subject as
mere verbiage.
As an example of the second type, consider the doctrine
of primary and secondary qualities, one of the most influ-
ential doctrines in the development of modern philosophy.
The average man knows the meanings of each of the words.
But just what a philosopher like John Locke or Bishop
Berkeley meant by a primary quality and by a secondary
quality, and by the distinction between them, is still a mat-
ter of contention among students of their writings. This is
only one example of the way in which common words have
been combined to form a highly technical term. The hy-
phenated word space-time in the writings of Samuel Alex-
ander is a conspicuous example in contemporary philoso-
phy.
Consider next such terms as idea, good and experience.
There are at least four different meanings of the word idea
in philosophy and as many of the word idealism as the
name of a general type of philosophic thought. The word
good has as many meanings, and they are as incompatible
as are the various meanings of the word idea. The term
experience is especially baffling. In the philosophy of prag-
matism it has a highly technical and specialized meaning,
which is as difficult to comprehend as is the word event in
the philosophy of Whitehead. But the same word is used
in an entirely different, and yet in a special technical sense,
by various other philosophers. The student must realize
the importance of learning the technical meaning of such
words in the setting of the philosophy in which they are
used. Never assume the popular to be the same as the tech-
nical meaning nor one technical meaning to be identical with
another.
(B) Technical words from other fields of knowledge
used in a different technical sense in philosophy. The situa-
tion just described in reference to ordinary words in com-
mon everyday usage is duplicated with regard to many of
the technical terms in science, theology, art, and other as-
pects of knowledge and culture. Many of the technical
words of philosophy have been taken over by philosophers
from some special natural or social science, or from some
branch of culture; and the meaning of such terms in phi-
losophy is often quite different from their meaning in the
field from which they were taken. The reverse process is
also common both for ordinary words and for technical
terms. Technical philosophical terms are adapted to the
special sciences and to the "man in the street," and lose
much, and sometimes all, of their philosophical import in
the process. The term realism means one thing in literature,
painting, music, and politics and quite another thing in phi-
losophy. In fact this word, like idealism, has several mean-
ings in philosophy. The term God means one thing in popu-
lar speech, another thing in Christian theology, and quite
a different thing in an idealistic type of philosophy such as
Hegelianism. The term energy is a technical term in
science which many philosophers have taken over and
adapted to their purpose, changing its meaning. The term
evolution has entirely different meanings when used in the
biological sciences from what it has in the philosophy of
creative evolution of the distinguished French philosopher,
Henri Bergson, or in the philosophy of Herbert Spencer.
Numerous other examples could be given of technical words
taken over from some special field of knowledge by phi-
losophers, who adapt them to their own purpose, and
thereby invest them with a new technical meaning. The well-
known list of Aristotelian categories or general class names,
namely, substance, quantity, quality, relation, time, place,
situation, state or condition, passivity and activity, as well
as such Kantian categories as causality, necessity, possi-
bility and probability, are good examples of technical philo-
sophical terms which have filtered down to common usage.
William James has given an interesting discussion of these
in his chapter on "Common Sense" in Pragmatism, in which
he attempts to show how they were originated by prehis-
toric geniuses, formalized by Aristotle, polished and made
precise by the mediaeval schoolmen, and through this pro-
cess were made the basic general ideas of Everyman's Phi-
losophy. (See Part IV, Chap. Ill, 3.) Examples such as
these show how the student must be forever on his guard
against assuming that the philosophical usage of a technical
scientific or theological term is the same as that of the
scientific or theological usage.
(C) Technical terms invented by philosophers. Phi-
losophers also claim the right to invent special technical
terms to convey their meanings. In fact, as was suggested
above, many of the technical terms of special fields and
many of the common words of the vernacular were origi-
nated by some philosopher. The number of words we owe
to Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient philosophers is sim-
ply unbelievable to anyone who has never studied the ques-
tion. Every great philosopher in our circle of culture has
enriched the language with various words, having in his
philosophy a technical sense and originally used by him for
a special purpose. This is not only true of the thinkers of
the past, for the philosophers of today are constantly
creating special technical terms. The terms neutralism and
subsistence are good examples. So also are Nietzsche's terms
superman and transvaluation of all values (Umwertung
aller JVerte), Spengler's distinction between the Coper-
nican and the Ptolemaic theories of history, Bergson's term
elan vital or vital impetus, Driesch's term entelechy,
adapted from Aristotle, and the term logistic which is fre-
quently used to designate the new symbolic logic to distin-
guish it from other types of logic. Technical terms originat-
ing in philosophy can only be understood by reading them in
their philosophic context. Since so much of our language has
been created by philosophy, the mother of the sciences,
every student of literature and philology finds some knowl-
edge of philosophy highly desirable. Chiefly for this reason
the study of philosophy has enormous cultural and practical
value.
2. How to Deal with the Technicalities of Philosophy
Every student of philosophy should keep a special philo-
sophical dictionary in which he writes down from time to
time the technical terms he finds especially baffling, with
some quotations illustrative of the different senses in which
the term is used. It is also a good plan to make a special
glossarial index of each book or technical essay which you
read in the field of philosophy. List the important terms
and phrases used, and differentiate the various meanings.
Do not depend upon small one-volume dictionaries. Con-
sult the new Murray Dictionary of the English Language
or the Century Dictionary and Encyclopedia. The defini-
tions of philosophical terms in the latter were originally
prepared under the direction of, and many of them were
written by, Charles S. Peirce, one of the greatest American
philosophers. This fact alone makes that work of per-
manent value to students of philosophy.
Reading dictionary definitions of technical terms in phi-
iosophy will not suffice. Discuss the words you do not under-
ORIENTATION
stand with other students and find out whether they inter-
pret them the same way that you do. Ask your teacher, or
tutor, or some older well-read person what he thinks the
term means. Do this regardless of the fact that the word
may seem to you to be so simple that you are ashamed to
ask what it means. Do not assume that the philosophical
usage of a term is simple, just because the word itself is
one everybody is supposed to comprehend. As was pointed
out above, the commonest terms in everyday use fre-
quently have some profound philosophical import entirely
different from their usual meaning. For example, George
Santayana has written an important philosophical discus-
sion on the various meanings of the word is.2 The essen-
tial point for the student to grasp at the outset of the study
of philosophy is the absolute necessity of assuming that any
word he reads in a book on philosophy, even though it be
the most innocent-looking word in the language, may have
some special signification for a philosopher. To be fully
cognizant of this fact is to be armed for the struggle with
the thorny technicalities of this field of knowledge.
Stress as one must the necessity of learning the technical
terms of philosophy, yet it must also be strongly emphasized
that the beginning student cannot hope to make headway
in the subject by a pedantic quibbling over what particular
terms mean. Many a potential philosopher has fallen so
deeply in love with the game of making the meaning of
philosophical terms absolutely precise and clear to himself
that he has missed the fundamental insights of the great
thinkers. Others have become so discouraged that they have
abandoned the attempt to learn what philosophy is and
says.
The student must go on reading, even though there are
many ideas that are not altogether clear to him. They will
become clearer later. Get what you can from a passage
and read on further. Remember that a philosopher is in-
2 See the Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XII, pp. 66ff.
clined to put his whole philosophy into practically every-
thing that he writes. If you do not get an understanding of
his philosophy from one essay or book, read others. If you
are working on a late writing, look up his earliest writings
where you can get a statement of his philosophy before his
views matured. Check the latest by the earliest writing of a
philosopher on the same subject. Following this rule will
frequently throw light on a thinker's obscurities and techni-
calities. Live with a philosopher until you get beyond the
mere technicalities of his system of ideas and absorb the
deeper spirit of his philosophy. This is absolutely essential
if one would master the subject.
Choose some first-rate representative of a school and
carefully read what he says over and over again, until you
have fully appreciated the spirit and the general viewpoint
of the man. But reserve judgment on what he says. Do not
believe him. Entertain his ideas sympathetically, without
accepting them as final. Remember that he is only one phi-
losopher among many. He represents just one type of
philosophic thought. There are equally great representa-
tives of other types. Do not let any single philosopher be-
guile you into thinking that he alone possesses the "phi-
losopher's stone," which to possess opens the mind to an
understanding of all philosophic mysteries. For you must
seek that stone for yourself. You dare not surrender to
the bewitchments of any philosopher who may seem to you
to write as though he had found it. Philosophy is an endless
quest, an age-long search for the hidden depths of reality.
No single school, much less any single philosopher, how-
ever great, has a monopoly on all of its wisdom and all of
its knowledge. It cannot be confined within the peanut
shells of technical terms. It cannot be exhausted by any
finite mind nor by any group of minds. It bursts all bounds.
Sub specie aeternilatis—to see all things from the viewpoint
of the eternal—this was Spinoza's absorbing ambition. If
this be judged too difficult, encouragement may be found in

another of his immortal sayings: "All things excellent are
as difficult as they are rare."
3. The Cyclical Theory of Learning Applied to thb
Study of Philosophy
In a penetrating discussion of education entitled "The
Rhythmic Claims of Freedom and Discipline," A. N.
Whitehead has developed a highly interesting and valuable
theory of learning, which has special application to the
study of philosophy.8 Let us call his theory the cyclical
theory of learning.
Three requirements must be met, he thinks, in the mas-
tery of any field of knowledge. These are interest, disci-
pline and freedom. The student will not devote his energies
to that which does^not interest him. Every subject that is
really mastered must appeal to the student and draw him on
to the point where he wants to comprehend it through and
through. But mastery requires that the student shall break
the backbone of the subject in a wrestling bout with its
technicalities. The details must be learned by patient,
plodding, laborious study. This is discipline. Yet all of these
details cannot be retained permanently. They will drop out
of mind after they have been mastered, many never to re-
turn again. Indeed they must drop out if the student is to
become a sure wielder of the type of power embodied in
that field of knowledge. For he must penetrate to its laws
and principles, and the details must be considered just the
instruments by which he gets^ji_finn_grasP on these funda-
mental principles. This deeper insight makes tor freedom,
because it gives one control over the field of knowledge in
question to such an extent that he can create additions to
it. Mastery of any subject requires that one pass from in-
terest through discipline to freedom. This is Whitehead's
theory of learning.
8 See A. N. Whitehead: The Aims of Education and Other Essays, Chap-
ter III. Reprinted from the Hibbert Journal, Vol. XXI, pp. 6578.
He recognizes, however, that all three of these require-
ments must be met for each student at each stage in his
learning. This is the reason for calling his theory a cyclical
theory. Every student must feel something of the freedom
of the master as he advances in his study. He must also
continue to retain and satisfy his interest in the field he is
endeavoring to master. Unless interest and freedom are
both being satisfied, even while he wrestles with the details,
the student will lose his enthusiasm for the subject and his
sense of its importance. His work will become an unrelieved
and meaningless drudgery. Hence studying a subject must
alternate between interest, discipline, and freedom from ^
the beginning to the end. There must be a cyclical move-
ment all along the line of advance to the goal of complete
mastery. That is why Whitehead is right in saying that we
can never educate our youths by hiring professors to spout
at them. Some study must be motivated wholly by the de-
sire to satisfy interest. Other study must center on the mas-
tery of details to satisfy discipline. But this must yield to
periods of study to satisfy freedom. The principle of self-
education is assumed throughout.
Applying this cyclical theory of learning to the study of
philosophy the student will find that he can best satisfy its
demands, and thereby get the most value and benefit from
his work, by reading each assignment three times. Read
what is required through once for interest. Do not attempt
to understand everything. Merely note the ideas that are
not clear to you. Explore the passage with the sole aim of
locating in it whatever it contains that may interest you.
Let your fancies play over the various ideas as you read.
Aim deliberately to get as much enjoyment out of this
precursory reading as you can. For it is to be a reading to
satisfy interest only. After finishing this fairly rapid read-
ing lay the book down for a moment and change your
mood. Resolve that now you are going to do your very
best to understand the selection. Then read it again slowly
40
ORIENTATION
and carefully to satisfy this resolution. Read it for dis-
cipline. This will be quite arduous, for you are setting your
mind against that of the author. Do not become discour-
aged if he seems to have the advantage. Wrestle with his
technicalities. Underline his key phrases and sentences.
Outline and analyze his argument. If he could spend the
time it took him to write the selection, and if his publisher
could go to the expense of publishing what he wrote, surely
you can afford to exert yourself enough so that you can think
his thoughts after him. The burden of proof is upon
you if you think he does not know what he is talking about.
You may possibly be too stupid or lazy to fathom his
ideas. Surely you must think twice and tackle him again
before admitting this. You have now presumably finished
this second hard reading, and you have satisfied the de-
mands both of interest and of discipline. Change your mood
again and get ready to satisfy freedom. Develop a critical
or questioning attitude. Carry on a dialogue between your-
self and the author. Ask yourself whether you agree with
his basic ideas as you now understand them. Put various
mental questions to him. Try to formulate the assump-
tions you think lie behind his written statements. Form
some definite reaction to what he has said, at least pro-
visionally. Turn over the pages of his article slowly and
summarize his main line of argument. This third study
will satisfy your demand for freedom. You should now be
prepared to go to the classroom, or to some tutor or friend,
for a purposeful philosophical discussion of what you have
read. You will have a certain sense of mastery over the
assigned work. Of course one cannot change himself from
one mood to another as one turns on or off an electric light.
But to recognize the three significant requirements of learn-
ing, and to make oneself as malleable as possible to their
influence is of the utmost importance.
Repeat this cyclical process with each new assignment,
and by the time you have finished a course in the subject
you will find yourself beginning to appreciate philosophy
and to see into its depths. It can satisfy all three of the
fundamental demands of your nature, a thing which can
hardly be said of every subject. Study it faithfully to the
point of mastery, and you will experience the supreme in-
tellectual enjoyment which especially accompanies philo-
sophic attainment.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHOD
i. The Importance of Method in Philosophy
ARE there practical technical methods in philosophy?
Are there definite ways of reasoning which will lead
him who understands how to use them into the inmost
recesses of ultimate reality? Few questions in philosophy
are more important than this, since the answer given to it
determines whether philosophy is to be relegated to the
intellectual junkheap of antiquated pseudo-sciences like
alchemy and astrology or whether it is to be given a per-
manent status among modern branches of human knowl-
edge.
/ Every type of philosophy which has attained standing in
the modern world has been developed methodically. The
best approach to an understanding of each type is through
an understanding of its basic method or methods of rea-
soning. The thinkers who have made the most valuable
contributions to each type of philosophy have been those
who have deliberately pursued their investigations by means
of characteristic methods. Moreover, it is the fact that they
have employed essentially the same method or methods,
which really justifies grouping philosophers together as rep-
resentatives of one type. For such thinkers frequently dif-
fer considerably from one another in their development
of specific doctrines and theories.
A good test of the quality of a thinker is whether he has
reached his conclusions haphazardly or by following defi-
nite procedure. Philosophers always apply this test. Phi-
losophies of life expounded by the unphilosophical are de-

nied recognition because they are merely aphoristic and
lack the consistency of a philosophy built up by a definite
method. Many an obscure passage in the writings of the
great philosophers becomes clear only to those who read
widely enough in their writings to grasp their method. Con-
sequently that the student know what philosophical method
is in general, as well as what the special methods are which
are employed by separate schools of philosophy, is of
supreme importance.
2. The General Structure of Deductive Systems
Thanks to the patient investigations made by penetrating
mathematicians and logicians in recent years the general,
formal structure of deductive systems of thought has been
made clear and precise. Such systems are constituted by a
set of postulates or assumed principles. The general ideas
used in these postulates and in the systems are accurately
defined. They are called "primitive ideas." The postulates
and the definitions of a deductive system are regarded as
independent within their own system, even though they
may not be within some other system. On these definitions
and postulates various theorems are based. Ultimately
the proof for each theorem rests back upon the primitive
elements of the system, but these theorems may form series
such that one is used in proving another. The deductive sys-
tem consists of the entire set of theorems, and includes the
proofs for them and the primitive elements upon which they
are based. When the reasoning by which the theorems are
established is rigid and valid, the entire deductive system
has internal consistency. An important test of this con-
sistency is the substituting of an entirely different set of
entities within the system. If such a substitution can be
made without the form of the system being changed, we
know that the system in question has a high degree of in-
ternal consistency.
An example of such a deductive system is plane geome-
44
ORIENTATION
try. The five axioms and the definitions of the terms used
in the axioms are the primitive elements of the system, and
the various propositions which are proved by means of
these axioms are the theorems. All together constitute the
system of plane geometry—a system which possesses al-
most perfect internal consistency. In recent years many
other geometries, for example, Riemann's geometry, have
been built up by using other primitive ideas. Each of
these geometries can be shown to possess a high degree
of internal consistency. Aristotelian syllogistic logic is an-
other deductive system having a genuine self-consistency,
but in recent years logicians have discovered many other
logics which are equally or even more consistent.
3. Philosophical Systems as Deductive
Now all philosophical reflection is essentially deductive
in structure, however much induction it may exhibit. In
other words, no matter how much a philosopher may insist
upon starting with concrete facts, with what is given in
sense experience, with particular data that are open to the
observation and inspection of all, he nevertheless uses cer-
tain basic principles to interpret or to categorize these data.
Immanuel Kant, the great German philosopher who wrote
The Critique of Pure Reason and who really made philos-
ophy critical and methodical, called the principles used to
interpret data a priori principles because he regarded them
as being logically prior to sense experience. They are the
conditions which make human knowledge possible, accord-
ing to Kant. Some of these a priori principles he called
categories and that is why philosophers sometimes speak
of categorizing sense data. Kant called other general prin-
ciples schemata of pure reason, regulative ideas, and pure
intuitions. But regardless of what he called them, they were
all conceived by him to be the indispensable and minimum
requirements of any thinking whatsoever. When Kant asked
his famous questions: How is human knowledge possible?
What are the a priori or logically necessary principles which
make knowledge possible? What are the conditions that
are indispensable to any knowing whatever? he became the
founder of a new way of approaching philosophical prob-
lems and the father of critical philosophy. He simply
took it for granted that these a priori principles—cate-
gories, schemata, intuitions—are just as fundamental as a
mathematician thinks axioms and definitions are. Hence it
is all-important to know what the primitive principles are
on which knowledge rests.1
Modern philosophers pretty generally agree that phil-
osophical thinking does make use of and elicit principles of
interpretation or categories, even though some have grave
doubts about the accuracy of Kant's particular analysis of
the human knowing machine. Philosophical thinking is re-
flective. It gathers up the various data of common sense, of
science, of art, of religion, and rethinks these data with
more general categories than are used in any special branch
of knowledge. It is important to know what these more gen-
eral categories are. Any genuine understanding of a philos-
opher's reasoning depends absolutely upon one's grasp of
that philosopher's basic principles of interpretation. What
are the primitive ideas of a given philosopher's writings?
This is the question the student must never cease asking.
4. The Presuppositions of all Philosophic Reflection
The question naturally arises as to whether there are
any general principles which underlie any and every type of
philosophy. We have just suggested that each individual
philosopher always employs such a set of basic categories.
But is there a set that every philosopher, regardless of the
type of philosophy he personally represents, must acknowl-
edge? Is there a set of common universal postulates on
which all philosophy rests?
It must be frankly admitted that there are extreme rela-
1See the selections from Kant in my Anthology of Modern Philosophy.
ORIENTATION
tivists and adamantine sceptics who deny that there is a com-
mon set of principles at the basis of all philosophizing.
Such thinkers argue that philosophy is bound to be deter-
mined either by personal and individual idiosyncrasies or
by the social pattern of the group to which the philosopher
belongs. There is, according to such thinkers, no hope what-
ever of reaching any agreement on philosophical questions.
Our philosophy will be what we are or what our social
order is. One or the other of these is the ultimate source
of every philosophical system, and general unanimity is
impossible.
Now there is certainly much ground for this view in the
actual differences that have always existed, and that still
exist, between philosophical systems of the past and of the
present. The beginning student of the history of philosophy
soon forms the idea that every successive philosopher de-
molished the views of his predecessors, and then proceeded
to construct a speculative system just as vulnerable as the
ones he destroyed. At least later thinkers were able to pick
it to pieces. On first acquaintance with the history of phi-
losophy one gets the impression that iconoclasm has dom-
inated it with a vengeance.
It must also be admitted that those philosophers who
attempt to state what they think are the common presuppo-
sitions of the philosophic quest almost invariably read into
these presuppositions those which are really characteristic
of their own type of philosophy. It is extremely difficult for
any philosopher to separate the basic presuppositions of all
philosophical reflection whatsover from those of the type
of philosophy he holds. This is evidenced by the fact that
a philosopher dislikes being labeled as belonging to one type
rather than to another. Deep down in his heart of hearts
every philosopher knows that there is much truth in the
theories of other philosophers; so he likes to think that his
view is unique in the sense that his philosophy more ade-
quately comprises the truths in opposing views than does
47
the philosophy of others. Calling such a thinker an idealist,
or a realist, or a pragmatist, or any other philosophic name
is often as much of an insult as waving a red flag in the
face of a bull. Yet he who would tell the story of philosophy
so that it can be understood must run the risk of offering
this insult. He must use labels. And he is justified in so
doing by the fact that philosophers themselves are guilty
of mixing up with the general principles of all philosophic
reflection those that are peculiar to some one type of phi-
losophy or even to their personal viewpoint. When philos-
ophers differentiate carefully among these kinds of
principles, it may be possible to make a new label for
objective and universal philosophy, reserving the old
labels for specialized views or discarding them altogether.
It is the fault of philosophers themselves that the
common principles on which they agree have never been
clarified and that there is no apparent unanimity among
philosophers. However, the fact that these principles have
never been clarified is no proof that they do not exist or
that they are by nature unknowable. To be a philosopher at
all one must at least make the assumption that there is such
a thing as philosophy to which one is justified in devoting
his energies. Here is one principle that, it would seem, no
genuine philosopher could really seriously doubt.
5. Hocking's Statement of the Presuppositions of
Philosophy
In his presidential address at a recent meeting of the
American Philosophical Association W. E. Hocking called
attention to the crying need of formulating the basic pre-
suppositions of the philosophic enterprise, and he made a
serious and highly commendable effort to bring to light these
presuppositions. Let us briefly consider his interesting list.
First, the philosopher must assume that there are par-
ticular meanings in the world. To deny that there are any
meanings cuts the very taproot of philosophy. And those
ORIENTATION
who come to the conclusion that all meanings are evanescent
or of doubtful reality find their enthusiasm for philosophical
reflection waning away. Their originality withers, they be-
come mere pedants, or they turn towards some other quest
than that of philosophic truth. But we must not interpret
this postulate to mean that there are only particular mean-
ings and that the totality of particular meanings is mean-
ingless as a whole. If there are particular meanings, there
must also be a single meaning, or, at least, the world as a
whole must have meaning in order for particular meanings
I to exist. For, as Hocking rightly says, "Unless the whole
of a life has meaning, the meanings of the parts are
illusory";2 and the same is true, only more strikingly, of
more inclusive wholes: state, humanity, world. The fact
that meanings, especially those of the larger wholes, leak
away when we would quaff them, must not blind us to the
reality of the meaning of such wholes. The wider meanings
are like Tennyson's gleam. This is especially true of the
most inclusive meaning of all—the meaning of the whole.
It is elusive or afar, and we must pursue it all the harder
when the meaning of some lesser whole grows dim and dis-
appears.
Not of the sunlight,
Not of the moonlight,
Not of the starlight!
O young Mariner,
Down to the haven,
Call your companions,
Launch your vessel
And crowd your canvas,
And, ere it vanishes
Over the margin,
After it, follow it,
Follow the Gleam.
The second postulate every philosopher must accept is
the competency of human beings, with their reason and
2 Quoted from my Anthology of Recent Philosophy, p. 37, where most of
Hocking's presidential address is reprinted from the Philosophical Review,
Vol. XXXVII, pp. 140-155.
49
other equipment, to grasp particular meanings and the
meaning of the whole, or some of it. Even though in a par-
ticular case we may fail to see any meaning, nevertheless
wejnust assume that it is there, and that we would be able
to fincTTt could we 1jut~see rt~sub specie aeternitatis—from
the point of view of eternity. Talk as we will about "the
abysmal mystery of existence"—the phrase is Cohen's—
still we must not give up hope that we can dispel with our
human reason some of this mystery. This second postulate
rests back on the first, for "to suppose that the world has
produced meaning-seekers incompetent to assess meanings
is to suppose a typically meaningless situation, such as our
first postulate forbids us to assume." (Hocking).
The third and last postulate is that it is worth while to
know the meanings of things and that we as thinkers are
under a kind of obligation to inquire after them. We are
driven by the reality of meanings and of meaning to seek
these meanings and this meaning until we find them and it.
As we have already learned, there is a restless curiosity in
the nature of man, a deep craving to know, which drives
him on in the quest for philosophic comprehension of the
meaning of each particular experiencej and of the meaning
of the world as a whole. Even what is often regarded as a
meaningless fact must be faced, must be caught up into a
larger whole and thereby be given a meaning. Here, then,
are three ultimate postulates on which Hocking thinks the
entire philosophic enterprise rests.
Is he not right? Some philosophers may think that he
has woefully erred in that he has stated his three postu-
lates so as to give them a twist towards idealism and in that
he has failed to define the terms used in them. Undoubt-
edly he has. But if these three postulates constitute ideal-
ism, is not every philosopher committed to that much of
.idealism? In any event we are forced to recognize that
philosophy dries up at the roots whenever we conclude that

5Q
ORIENTATION
we live in a meaningless world and that our pursuit of
meanings is doomed to failure.
6. How to Criticise a Philosopher
There are, however, certain other more restricted postu-
lates at the basis of every particular philosopher's writings.
These are sometimes explicitly stated, but frequently they
are kept in the background. What the individual philoso-
pher usually does is first to state all the objections he can
think of to the views to which he is opposed, and then to
construct his own interpretation as though it were entirely
free from the errors he has pointed out in others. His own
ultimate premises are often kept in the background and
have to be brought to light by his reader. Hence the stu-
dent of philosophy must learn to tjjink critically so that he
can discover what are the covert premises and presupposi-
tions on which an author's general theories are based. And,
in particular, he must learn that a philosopher is never as
fond of, or as sympathetic with, the views of others as he
is with his own. It is a peculiarity of philosophers to write
as though no one else ever fully comprehended the prob-
lems of philosophy adequately and as though they alone
had penetrated the veil of mystery. And it is another pecu-
liarity of philosophers to assert that they are never really
understood by a critic, for if they were how could he find
fault with their view? This is not pompous conceit in a phi-
losopher nor is it mere vanity, guilty though some philoso-
phers may be of these two faults. It is rather the inevitable
result of the attainment of a real insight into philosophic
truth. Let me illustrate what I mean with a criticism
Bernard Bosanquet has made of William James's Prag-
matism.
"It just illustrates the difference between looking at
philosophy from without and working at it from within,
that after some hundreds of pages of discussion James
finds himself, in essence, affirming the view the acceptance
51
of which by Leibniz he began by treating with contempt."
I think that it would be generally agreed that this is a
valid criticism of James, but let us think rather of the
principle used in making the criticism. The distinction here
made, between a philosopher looking at philosophy from
without and working at it from within, is of the utmost
importance. It may be taken as a general rule that when
a philosopher is criticising another philosopher, he is look-
ing at that man's philosophy from without. Likewise it
may be taken as a general rule that when he is expounding
his own view he is working at philosophy from within.
And there is a vast difference. A philosopher may charge
another philosopher with making an egregious blunder in
his thinking, as James charged Leibniz with doing in ex-
pounding his theory that this is the best of all possible
worlds. Yet that same philosopher may actually adopt
almost the same position as the one he criticised, as James
did when he said that, after all, this world of contingency
in which we live is just the kind of a world we want. Many
illustrations of this fact could be found in the writings of
philosophers.
It follows that the student must attach much less impor-
tance to the controversial parts of a philosophic treatise
than to the constructive parts. The former are valuable
because they frequently give a clue to what the author dis-
likes. In them we find the ideas he would like to discredit
or subordinate to some idea he regards as more suitable.
But the constructive parts give us the philosopher's own
views, and these we must examine critically to ascertain
whether they are as free from the errors he has pointed out
in others, or from other types of error equally bad, as
he would lead the reader to believe. No philosophical dis-
cussion should be swallowed whole—bait, hook, and sinker.
Let me repeat and reemphasize what was said at the end
of the preceding chapter. Reserve judgment while you read
and try to understand. Resist with all your power the effort
52
ORIENTATION
every philosopher consciously or unconsciously makes to in-
doctrinate you with the idea that he has found the true
philosophy. The greatest philosophers want you to be inde-
pendent in your thinking. They seek for disciples only
among those who know their system of ideas through and
through, and who see its limitations as well as its strong
points. They like to have a^reader reserve judgment. They
want their statements examined and criticised. They want
the life view you get to be yours, not theirs. Beware of the
propagandist type of philosopher. He has missed his call-
ing. He belongs either in the pulpit or in the journalistic
profession. Follow the man who you are sure has reached a
fundamental insight, not that you may slavishly and abjectly
worship him, but that you too may rise to that level of self-
consciousness where you can achieve an insight of your own.
As W. E. Hocking puts it: "There you may find or recover
the vision which nullifies all imposture of the Established,
the Entrenched, of all the self-satisfied Toryisms, Capi-
talisms, Obscurantisms of the world. And there you may find
what is not less necessary for originality: unity in the midst
of necessary and unnecessary flux, quiet confidence in your
own eye-sight in the presence of the Newest, the Noisiest,
the Scientificalest, the Blatantest, all the brow-beating expo-
sitions of pseudo-Originality, pseudo-Progress." 8 It is not
among the least of the values of philosophy that one who
assiduously devotes himself to philosophical reflection ob-
tains such a vision.

BRANCHES, PROBLEMS, AND TYPES OF PHILOSOPHY
IN OUTLINE
i. The Chief Branches of Philosophy
ASURVEY of the field of philosophy reveals many
branches. Moreover, as the mother of the sciences,
philosophy has vitally influenced every great science. Indeed
the special sciences were all parts of philosophy until they
developed specific content that was precise and definite
enough to enable them to stand on their own feet as sepa-
rate disciplines. For example, even as late as the eighteenth
century physics was known as natural philosophy and
formed a part of the department of philosophy in colleges.
In many institutions psychology and education are still
included in the philosophy department, although they
are now generally regarded as independent disciplines.
Undoubtedly this tendency for separate subjects to form
within the field of philosophy, and then gradually to split
off and become independent, will continue as human knowl-
edge grows. The fact that philosophy has been, and still is,
the matrix for the generation of special sciences, makes it
all the more imperative that students who plan to devote
their lives to scientific research should gain an acquaintance
with the subject-matter of philosophy and an understanding
of its scope. In this preliminary survey of the field those
subjects which are still a part of philosophy will be consid-
ered, but those that have already achieved a separate status
will not be discussed.
Following the suggestion at the end of Chapter I, let us
make the fundamental division between critical and specti-
53
54

lative philosophy. The former is primarily concerned with
the critique or criticism of human knowledge and with the
study of the general methods and principles of human rea-
soning. Hence its two chief branches are epistemology and
logic. Epistemology is a combination of the Greek words
kinoTiiiiri and X670S and means literally the science of
knowledge. This branch of philosophy studies the human
knowing machinery with a view to determining how men
think and what the underlying conditions or the implicit
assumptions in knowing are. Since the time of the great
French philosopher, Rene Descartes (1596-1650), and
especially since the time of David Hume (1711-1776),
and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), this branch of philoso-
phy has been generally recognized by philosophers of all
schools as being of paramount importance. One may sub-
divide epistemology into Psychological and Metaphysical
Epistemology. The former deals with the knowing processes
analytically and descriptively. The latter studies the fruits
of these processes, inquiring into the nature of meaning
as embodied in human knowledge and its status in the uni-
verse as a whole. To put it differently, psychological episte-
mology is chiefly interested in knowledge as an aspect of
human mental activity, raising the question of how know-
ing arises in the evolution of mind, its relation to, and
status among, other phases of mind. Metaphysical episte-
mology, on the other hand, is chiefly interested in the place
of knowledge in the wider universe, in whether or not it is
identical with reality as a whole. One is subjective,
looking at knowledge as related to the subject who has it;
the other is objective, looking at knowledge as related to
the content known. Since both approaches to epistemology
are necessary to an understanding of what knowledge is,
these two branches of critical philosophy are by no means
mutually exclusive, but, on the contrary, they are mutually
supplementary. The student should note especially that
some philosophers use the terms cognition and cognitive
BRANCHES, PROBLEMS^ TYPES OF PHILOSOPHY 55
process in preference to the terms knowledge and know-
ing, whereas others use all these terms interchangeably.
Logic is a much older branch of philosophy than episte-
mology, and formerly included the latter in its own sub-
ject-matter. The earliest type of logic is the Aristotelian
Formal Logic, named after Aristotle, who was the first to
formalize and to organize into a separate branch of phi-
losophy such logical theories and ideas as had been devel-
oped up to his time. He also developed the method of
reasoning known as the syllogism, in which, by comparing
two logical terms first with a common or middle term, a
conclusion is then drawn about their relation to each other.
Aristotelian Formal Logic well exemplifies the fundamental
purpose of logic, which is to bring to light and to develop
systematically and formally the essential axioms, rules, and
principles of human reasoning. Some philosophers think
that syllogistic logic is still important, even though they
believe that it should be supplemented and modified to take
account of modern developments. Others think that Aris-
totelian Logic is an anachronism in modern life, and they
would junk it entirely. Hence other types of logic have
arisen.
One of these is Metaphysical Logic, which is chiefly a
development of the logic of Hegel (1770-1831), who ex-
panded the epistemology of Kant into a theory that reason
is the essence of the natural order as well as of human
nature. To comprehend reasoning in men is to comprehend
rationality as exhibited in and through all reality. Meta-
physical logic is practically identical with metaphysical epi-
stemology, according to this type of logic. In my opinion
the so-called Experimental Logic of John Dewey and his
school is a metaphysical logic, although it differs consid-
erably from the Hegelian type. In recent years, under the
leadership of such logicians as Boole, Venn, Schroder, and
later of Peano, Couturat, Whitehead, and Russell, a branch
ORIENTATION
of logic known as Mathematical or Symbolic Logic has been
evolved. It abandons ordinary language in favor of a highly
technical set of symbols, similar to those used in higher
mathematics. Thus it seeks greater precision and formal
exactness in expressing all logical relations, which are
thought to possess a validity independent of the human
mind. To indicate the kind of reality such relations have
some logicians use the word subsistence. This means that
such relations constitute a logical order of reality which
does not exist either in the subjective or in the objective
sense, either as mental or as physical. Yet in a sense the
world of subsistence is more real than the world of exist-
ence, since it is the framework on which the latter is hung. *
At bottom, therefore, symbolic logic is also a metaphysical
type of logic. It is highly technical and abstract, and it can-
not be discussed in detail in a course in the introduction to
philosophy.
A fourth type of logic is Applied Logic or Methodology.
It i« frequently referred to as Inductive Logic, in contrast
with the Deductive Logic of Aristotle. This type of logic
examines in detail and criticises the various methods of
research used in investigating any field of facts. It includes
a study of the statistical method, the genetic and compara-
tive methods, sampling, classification, the experimental and
observational methods employed in the physical sciences,
and the methods of hypothesis, explanation, and analogy.
In fact, a critical evaluation of all of the general meth-
ods of scientific research may be said to constitute the
branch of philosophy known as methodology or applied
logic.
Logic is so complicated, and is such a closed system of
philosophical knowledge, that a separate course is really
required to introduce students to it. Such a course is usually
a combination of the traditional Aristotelian Formal Logic,
modified to suit the taste of the instructor, and a study of
methodology.1 Metaphysical Logic and Symbolic Logic, as
well as epistemology, are so intolerably technical that they
are usually not studied very assiduously outside of the
leading Graduate Schools, but they form essential parts
of the curriculum of advanced courses in philosophy.
Turning now to speculative philosophy we find here two
chief divisions, metaphysics and theory of value. The word
metaphysics is sometimes used as a synonym for philosophy.
The word arose from the designating of certain of Aris-
totle's writings as metaphysica, "meta" meaning that which
comes after and <t>vas being the Greek word for nature.
In this rather accidental way our word metaphysics
• arose as a designation of that branch of philosophy which
studies all ultimate problems. It is highly speculative because
it seeks to answer the deepest problems which arise in con-
nection with separate studies of nature, like physics, chem-
istry, biology, and psychology, but which cannot be answered
without going beyond the data and the special laws of any
single science. Metaphysicians are often in bad repute even
among professed philosophers, especially among those who
are sceptical of our ever finding an answer to ultimate
problems.
Thou vainly curious mind which wouldst guess
Whence thou didst come, and whither thou mayst go,
And that which never yet was known wouldst know.
Thus might some characterize the metaphysician. Many
contemporary thinkers are firmly convinced that the meta-
physician wanders in a "no man's land," discovers only "the
night in which all cows are black," or the "lion's den into
which all tracks enter and from which none ever return."
Three distinct branches of metaphysics may be distin-
guished. Cosmology h the science of the cosmos or universe
1 See my logic text-book, The Principles of Reasoning, An Introduction to
Logic and Scientific Method, 2nd ed., 1930, and my logic sourcebook, Illus-
trations of the Methods of Reasoning, 1927, both published by D. Appleton
& Co. R. M. Eaton's General Logic contains a section devoted to Symbolic
Logic.
ORIENTATION
in its entirety and consists of speculations about the origin
and nature of the vast space-time world. Einstein's theory
of relativity is revolutionizing present-day cosmology.2
Ontology is the science of pure being. It deals with
the ultimate nature of existence and of subsistence, and
attempts to determine the various types of being, the vari-
ous levels of reality, the basic kinds of existence or sub-
sistence constituting the world of our human experience.
Are life and mind ultimately real? Is energy the root of
all other forms of being? Is the universe monistic or plu-
ralistic, i.e., one or many? These are samples of the ques-
tions dealt with in ontology.
Metaphysical Psychology deals with the ultimate nature
of mind or spirit or soul or personality. Is there a pure self
or ego, transcending the separate experiences of our lives?
If so, what is its nature? Is it a timeless self without a
body? Is it eternal? Did it preexist and will it continue to
exist after the death of the body? Is there ultimately only
one true self, or are there many selves? These are samples
of the questions dealt with in metaphysical psychology.
Metaphysics and all of its branches are among the most
ancient parts of philosophy.
Theory of Value is that branch of speculative philosophy
which inquires into the nature and status of value in the
universe. It may be subdivided into General Theory of
Value and the special departmental philosophies, each deal-
ing with some one type of value. General Theory of Value
is a new branch of philosophy, just separating itself from
metaphysics, as is made clear in R. B. Perry's recently pub-
lished and valuable treatise entitled The General Theory
of Value, as well as in W. C. Urban's important Valuation
—Its Nature and Its Laws. (See Part II, Chap. VI and
Part III, Chap. VI below.) They and their followers hope
2 For an example of the effect of the new physics on cosmology see A. S.
Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World and Sir J. Jeans's The
Mysterious Universe.
that this branch of philosophy may soon become a sepa-
rate science. It attempts to get at the generic nature of
value, presumably present in every type of value. There are
different theories as to what this generic character is. Some
writers identify it with one thing, and others with another,
and some deny that there is any generic value. One's gen-
eral theory of value determines his attitude toward each
of the branches of philosophy concerned with some specific
type of value.
The departmental philosophies of value are especially
important because each is concerned with the philosophical
interpretation of some special aspect of culture. Ethics
studies the nature of moral value, and the source and
nature of moral obligation or duty. Social and political
philosophy are concerned especially with economic and
communal values so far as these involve the interpenetra-
tion of minds in business and in play, and conflicts between
races and nations and cultures. Aesthetics studies the value
and nature of art in the broadest sense of the term, as
covering every expression of beauty in literature, music, the
fine arts, and in nature.
In addition to these three ancient branches of the phi-
losophy of value a large number of other departmental
philosophies should be mentioned. The philosophy of sci-
ence, including some account of the history of science, is
rapidly coming to the front. The philosophy of religion,
which differs from theology by attempting to give an un-
prejudiced interpretation of all religious experience and of
all religions, has become extremely important with our
increased knowledge of the world's great religions. The
philosophy of law, or jurisprudence, is growing in impor-
tance as society becomes more complicated. Recently a
great impetus has been given to the philosophy of history
by the publication of Oswald Spengler's The Decline of
the West. The philosophy of education is of special impor-
tance today in America. These various departmental phi-
ORIENTATION
losophies inevitably overlap more or less, and it is impos-
sible to study one without raising questions which belong
under some of the others. For all of our human cultural
values are perforce inextricably interrelated.

2. The General Problems of Philosophy
Each branch of philosophy has special problems which
are dealt with in separate books and courses. In a general
introduction to philosophy these special questions have to
be subordinated to the more general problems which over-
lap more or less the various branches. Consequently, it
seems best to organize the material around four of these
general problems, instead of attempting to develop the
content of each of the separate branches per se.
(1) The Problem of Knowledge and Existence.—The
general problem of knowledge and existence is concerned
with the various theories of the nature of knowledge and
of the ways of knowing, as well as with the theories of the
nature or meaning of existence, subsistence, and the types,
levels, or degrees of reality. What kind of reality is to be
attributed to space, time, physical objects, and their quali-
ties, psychical images, life, energy, beauty, God, et cetera?
What are the various ways human beings know the forms
of being? It is such questions as these that comprise the
general problem of knowledge and existence.
(2) The Problem of Truth and Error.—A closely
related general problem is that of the nature of truth and
error. This is also a complicated problem analyzable into
many others. It involves the various theories of the nature
of truth, the different criteria by which we distinguish truth
from falsity, the relation of truth to reality or to existence
or to subsistence and to value, and the problem of the meta-
physical status of human error, including the illusions of
perception as well as false beliefs or delusions.
(3) The Problem of the Relation of Mind and Body.—
Every philosopher has ultimately to face the problem of
the relation of the mind to the body, called the body-mind
or the mind-body problem. Various theories as to the na-
ture of mind and body have been set forth. A controversy
between the behavioristic and mechanistic interpretations
of mind, and the purposive and teleological interpretations
has long been raging with unabated fury, involving philoso-
phers of all schools. This problem has important bearings
on the problem of free-will in ethics and the philosophy of
religion, and this makes the solution of this body-mind
difficulty decisive in the development of an ethical and
religious philosophy of life.
ORIENTATION
(4) The Problem of Value and Evil.—Another general
problem of the greatest practical importance is that of the
nature and status of value in the universe. What do we
mean by value? What are the chief types or kinds of value?
Are values man-made and entirely relative to our creaturely
life, or are they non-human, eternal realities? And what
about evil in general and specific evils? What ultimate
status is to be given the evils of existence in one's philoso-
phy? How are we to define evil? How are we to get rid
of it, if at all? Such are the questions raised by the general
problem of value and evil.
3. The Chief Types of Philosophy
The way in which a given philosopher solves for himself
these four general problems largely determines the type of
philosophy which he holds. This is true even though there
is considerable agreement among philosophers of different
schools in the solutions given of these problems. For be-
neath the outward agreement there will be a variation in
emphasis and interpretation which makes one man a rep-
resentative of one and the other of another type of phi-
losophy. Moreover, in determining the chief types of
philosophy we have to consider the way in which the solu-
tion of one of these general problems dovetails into those
of the other problems. Even though some thinkers strongly
object to being classified, and bitterly condemn all philo-
sophic labels, it cannot be denied that distinct types of
philosophy exist today. An understanding of contemporary
philosophy depends upon one's gaining some insight into
the differences and similarities among these types.
We shall, therefore, organize our expositions around the
chief types and make use of the four problems listed above
to subdivide the material presented on each type. The
reader who so desires may read the separate discussions of
each problem successively, thereby making the problems
the main principle of organization instead of the types. It
may be found advantageous to study the material both
ways, using first one and then the other approach. Three
main types are distinguished: (1) Idealism, (2) Realism
and (3) Pragmatism, and each is dealt with at some length
in Parts II, III and IV respectively. In addition to the three
main types it will be necessary briefly to consider in Part V
some important movements under the general heading
Other Types.
It should be added that the History of Philosophy is a
distinct branch of philosophy which was not included above.
There are at least four different angles from which, the
study of the history of philosophy may be approached. One
may trace the chronological development of philosophy in
each of the great cultures, thus obtaining a bird's-eye view
of the main trends in philosophic development. Or we may
trace the history of the treatment of each of the general
problems of philosophy, especially those listed above. And
lastly, we may trace the history of the chief types. It is not
our purpose here to go into the history of philosophy, since
this really requires a separate course.3

IDEALISM
WHAT IDEALISM IS
I. The Words Idea, Ideal, and Idealism
PERHAPS the best approach to the nature of idealism
as a philosophy is through a discussion of the meanings
of the words idea, ideal and idealism. Hoernle has devoted
a chapter to the elucidation of the meanings of these words
in Idealism as a Philosophy (Ch. II), and there are excel-
lent articles on each of these terms in Hastings's Encyclo-
pedia of Religion and Ethics and on the word idealism in
the 14th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. All that
can be done here is to summarize the various significant
meanings of these words and in so doing these sources are
followed.
A. Idea.—In popular speech the word idea means any
object we think about. The term came into popular speech
from the philosophy of John Locke, but it has lost the defi-
nite and precise connotation it had in Locke's Essay Con-
cerning the Human Understanding. He defined an idea as
"whatsoever the mind perceives in itself, or is the imme-
diate object of perception, thought or understanding" (Bk.
II, Ch. VIII, 9). In psychology the term idea has a tech-
nical sense. The three stages in the growth of human knowl-
edge are called sensation, perception, and ideation. Ideas
appear in the third stage. According to the definition given
in Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology
V an idea is "the reproduction, with a more or less adequate
image, of an object not actually present to the senses." This
traditional psychological meaning of the word idea really
comes from the philosophy of David Hume. He defined an I
67
IDEALISM
idea as a .copy of an impression, and by an impression he
meant a sensation or what is "actually present to the
senses." But the word idea is much older than the philoso-
phy of Hume or that of Locke. It originated, we do not
know exactly how, in the Greek language, in the fifth cen-
tury B.C., but it was probably first used as a technical philo-
sophical term by Plato. And to him it had an entirely differ-
ent meaning from the two already given. His ideas are
"essences" or "real things," of which particular objects are
"copies." For example, there is a universal essence or idea
of horse or elephant, which contains all the essential attri-
butes of horse or elephant, and particular horses and ele-
phants participate in the nature of this essence of horse and
of elephant. That is what makes them horses and elephants.
To Plato there is a world of eternal and non-temporal
essences or ideas, and it is far more real than the world of
sensation. Later students of Plato, especially the so-called
Neo-Platonists and Christian philosophers, like St. Augus-
tine, changed Plato's conception by subordinating the world
of ideas to God. The ideas are intelligible essences, or
archetypes, in God's mind of the created objects making up
the visible world which surrounds us. This was the mean-
ing of the word idea which prevailed through the Middle
Ages and which still prevails among Platonists. There are,
then, four quite distinct meanings of the word idea. With
Plato an idea was an eternal pattern, more real even than
God; it was subordinated to God and was regarded as an
archetype in His mind by the Neo-Platonists; it was made
the immediate object of man's mind when he thinks by
Locke; and it was defined as a faint copy of a sense impres-
sion by Hume. Thus there has been what may be called a
degrading of the meaning of the word idea in the history
of philosophy.
! an ideal day or an ideal situation. The word comes from

WHAT IDEALISM IS
69
late Latin. Long after the word idea had been taken over
from the Greeks, the Romans formed the term idealis, and
it is the source of our word ideal. The word also has the
meaning of that which would be perfect could it but be
realized, with the implication that it cannot be, as when
we speak of an ideal university or college fraternity. All
existing universities and college fraternities fall a little
short of being ideal. It is with this connotation that the
word is most frequently used in philosophy/ Ideals are per-:
feet patterns which we strive to attain but never wholly
realize. The word is also frequently used in this sense in
art. In Peele Castle Wordsworth speaks of
Here the ideal is a perfection never actually realized in
existing things, yet it forever lures men on to higher
achievement. There is a third meaning of the word ideal
where it is used, somewhat in derision, of visionary schemes
that are altogether impractical, as when we speak of a
fanatic as an idealist. Henry Ford's plan to get the boys
out of the trenches by Christmas, involving his sending of
the Peace Ship to Europe, would be regarded by many as
a fantastic and visionary scheme and hence as being an
ideal in the bad sense. To the cynic even the noblest ideals
are of this type.
C. Idealism.—The popular meaning of idealism is deter-
mined by the meaning of the term ideal. Thus the term has
three popular senses—(i) visionary and unreal specula-
tions, (ii) lofty and unattainable moral, aesthetic, and reli-
gious standards, and (iii) high but attainable human goals.
The philosophical meaning of the term idealism is deter-
mined more by the meaning of the term idea. It refers to
those theories of the ultimate reality of the universe which
make that reality consist of ideas in any of the senses de-
fined above. Thus idealism may mean mentalism or subjec-
The light that never was, on sea or land,
The consecration and the poet's dream.
IDEALISM
five idealism or phenomenalism. According to this theory
the ultimate reality is either spirits and their ideas or a
heterogeneous collection of floating ideas, sometimes called
the stream of consciousness. On the other hand, idealism
may mean Platonism, the theory that behind the veil of
sense experience there is an ideal world of eternal essences,
ordered according to some definite principle, usually con-
ceived of as moral. Often this is referred to as the world of
truth, goodness, and beauty. Then, again, idealism may
mean Absolute Idealism, the theory that reality is a rational
process of the unfolding of ideas in nature and in human
history—a process which originated out of the Absolute
Idea and will return into it. Or the term idealism may mean
a Theistic Idealism, which makes God the supreme reality
and takes His ideas to be the patterns by which the world,
and all that is therein, are continuously being created and
sustained. Thus idealism as a philosophy is truly a coat of
many colors. We shall return to the question of the types of
idealism later, but first let us attempt to formulate the gen-
eral or common characteristics of idealism.
2. The General Characteristics of Idealism as a Philosophy
It is extremely difficult to formulate a definition of ideal-
ism that will cover all its forms. In fact it is so difficult
that many idealists will not even make the effort to define
it. And too often the critics of idealism pick what they
regard as the most vulnerable type, identify this with all
idealism, and then cast their lances at it, leaving the im-
pression that in refuting it they have disposed of idealism.
There is one thing that can be said of all forms of
idealism and that is that they profoundly respect culture.
All idealisms are deeply rooted in human culture and their
adherents know it. Hence idealists are likely to talk less
about progress and more about order and stability thaiT
other philosophers. Idealism subordinates all pursuit and
love of comfort, ease, and personal pleasure to the more
7i
objective ideals of culture. It strives to comprehend the
meaning and purpose of human history and of its institu-
tions. It regards the whole universe as under the control
of moral, religious, and aesthetic ends, and thinks of these
cultural values as being both supra-individual and supra-
social. Each particular person, and the politico-economic
social order as a whole, exists that these cultural ends may
be attained. Yet these general characteristics of idealism
are also characteristics of the world's great religions, and
they are entirely too widespread to be identified with ideal-
ism as a philosophical doctrine. Nevertheless it is impor-
tant to stress the fact that idealism as a philosophy shares
these views. Idealism is unquestionably that philosophy
which is most sympathetic with the religious attitude
toward life, and with the deep and far-reaching spiritual
aspirations of mankind, with man's longing for eternity
and for a real comprehension of the profound meaning of
the world. Idealism is almost the only philosophy which has
not abandoned the belief that every man has a destiny and
the assurance that ultimate reality is friendly to him in the
realization of that destiny. To its critics this is its most
serious weakness, but to its adherents this is its undying and
deathless strength.
When the attempt is made to get nearer to the heart of
idealism as a philosophy it is necessary to begin by asking
the all-important question: What is the ultimate reality
I that is given in experience? Now how does philosophical
idealism answer that profound question? "Metaphysical
idealism, in the only technical sense that we can ascribe to
the term, . . . implies that the relation of subject and
object is one of the essential starting points of philosophy,
and in its view of that relation it lays down the decisive
principle that objects can exist only for a subject, and that
the subject, which carries the objects within itself, is the
higher category, and as such must determine the process
7a
IDEALISM
of philosophical thought." 1 Here is one way of answering
the basic question of philosophy, and this way has generated
diverse forms of idealism.
One of the most novel and interesting of these forms is
solipsism—the view that the agent or subject doing the
thinking and his ideas are the only realities, and that all
the outer world is but a dream of the subject. Edgar Allan
Poe has well expressed this attitude in his little poem,
A Dream Within a Dream, only for Poe the subject is also
a dream.
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow—
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
A11 that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand—
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep, while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?
The critics of idealism take great delight in attempting
to show that such a view is the only logically consistent
form that idealism can take; and since such a view is absurd,
they hold that all idealism stands condemned because really

VII, p. 90 (Scribners).

based upon an absurd starting point. But Bradley, an out-
standing idealist, is the one who has shown most clearly
the logical absurdity of solipsism, which is that the solipsist
begs the whole question in asserting his own existence,
since the ego or self is never an immediate datum of expe-
rience but an extremely complex entity. As Hoernle puts it:
"Immediate experience, the solipsists' T and 'self,' is
always both 'that' and 'what,' both 'this' and 'such,'
both particular and universal, and it is the universal in it
that ever carries it beyond itself—the life in it of the whole
of which it is part." 2
What, then, is this whole of which the self or subject is
a part? Have we not given the wrong answer to our basic
question when we say that "the subject, which carries the
objects within itself, is the higher category"? Would this
not commit us to solipsism? Yes, if we mean by the subject
an individual finite mind. When we reflect deeply upon the
subject-object relation we are driven to this definition of
idealism. "Idealism as a philosophical doctrine conceives of
knowledge or experience as a process in which the two fac-
tors of subject and object stand in a relation of entire
interdependence on each other as warp and woof. . . .
Without mind no orderly world: only through the action
of the subject and its 'ideas' are the confused and inco-
herent data of sense-perception (themselves shot through
with both strands) built up into that system of things
which we call Nature, and which stands out against the
subject as the body stands out against the soul whose func-
tioning may be said to have created it. On the other hand,
without the world no mind: only through the action of the

XI, p. 680. The article from which the sentence is taken is entitled Solipsism.
It is very valuable, tracing the source of the word and the history of the
doctrine. It should be pointed out that Brightman, in making the self an im-
mediate datum, (see my Anthology of Recent Philosophy, p. 140) and "the
primary datum," logically commits himself to solipsism. He attributes this
view to Bowne and "most idealists." Perhaps he should have said "most
personalists." I think that this is a serious defect in personalism.
74
IDEALISM
environment upon the subject is the idealizing activity in
which it finds its being called into existence. Herein lies the
paradox which is also the deepest truth of our spiritual
life." 8 This way of answering the basic question of phi-
losophy certainly leads us away from solipsism. But where
does it conduct us? Straight into the jaws of absolutism—
so say the critics. Thus the pendulum of idealism swings
from the extreme of solipsism to the extreme of abso-
lutism. According to Absolute Idealism the whole of reality
is a single, self-ordered and intelligent whole of which
finite subjects and objects are but tiny parts. That whole
was called the Absolute or the Absolute Idea by Hegel.
Absolute Idealism has never really been refuted, although
its enemies have said that they are going to refute it. Its
basic principle has often been ignored or declared absurd,
but it has never been overthrown.
However, one can be an idealist without holding either
of the extreme positions. Here, as in many other matters,
the mean position is the true one. Hence a refutation of the
two extremes would leave idealism still essentially un-
scathed. It would be like trying to kill a giant by cutting
off his hair and his toenails. Even though Samson's
strength left him when they cut off his hair, he was able
to get it back again. Idealism is a giant like Samson. It may
be grinding at the mill of its enemies today, but tomorrow
it will cast the pillars and roofs of their temple upon them.
It is hardly likely that twenty-five or more years of the
twentieth century will destroy a philosophy that has nobly
flourished for twenty and more centuries. When idealism
dies opposing views will die too, and philosophy itself will
be no more.
3. Some Recent Classifications of Idealism
In A Philosophy of Ideals E. S. Brightman distinguishes
four chief types of idealism. The first of these is Platonic
8 J. H. Muirhead: Encyclopedia Britannica, 14th ed., Vol. XII, pp. 65 and 69.
IS
Idealism, which is characterized by the fact that it asserts
the objective reality of our human ideals and values. The
second is Berkeleian Idealism, named after its founder,
Bishop Berkeley. It holds that all that we can know as
human beings is of the nature of mind or consciousness.
But it also asserts that the probabilities are that all reality
is also mental in essence, including any part we do not
know. The third type is Hegelian Idealism, which argues
that the perfect coherence of one single intelligent system
is the only genuine reality or value. The fourth type is
Lotzean Idealism, named after the great German philoso-
pher Lotze. This type holds that selfhood or personality
is the only ultimate and fundamental reality. The third of
these types is sometimes called Speculative Idealism, and
the fourth Personalistic Idealism, or simply Personalis™ or
Theism.
Hoernle in Idealism as a Philosophy also distinguishes
four types of idealism that are similar to the four distin-
guished by Brightman, with exceptions that will be pointed
out presently. Absolute Idealism, which corresponds to the
Hegelian Idealism of Brightman, Hoernle acclaims as the
highest form which idealism has attained. Next to this in
importance is Spiritual Pluralism. This is the view that
spirits, or rather a "Society of Spirits" with God as
supreme, constitutes the ultimate reality. This includes
Personalism, which Brightman would rank highest, and
Berkeleian Idealism. Hoernle's third type is Spiritual
Monism, which "regards Reality as a single, impersonal,
spiritual force, manifesting itself in all things." He uses
Schopenhauer and Bergson and their followers to exem-
plify this type. Brightman's classification omits this kind of
idealism, but it certainly should be included in a complete
classification. For his fourth type Hoernle names Critical
Idealism, which is founded upon the critical philosophy of
Immanuel Kant. This type is sometimes called Scien-
tific Idealism. Brightman would probably put this under
IDEALISM
Hegelian Idealism, but it is really a distinct form of
idealism.4
Another important difference between these two classifi-
cations is that Brightman rightly regards Platonic Idealism
as a unique type. Here would belong the philosophy of
Dean Inge and other contemporary idealists. It would be
misleading to bring these men under any of the types differ-
entiated by Hoernle. On the other hand, both writers omit
the new idealism which has been developed in Italy by
Croce, Gentile, and others. While this is based on Hegelian-
ism, it is so distinct from the Absolute Idealism of Ger-
many, England, and America that it deserves special men-
tion. Accordingly, I would suggest the following classifica-
tion of contemporary idealism.
1. The Absolute as Spirit.
(Croce and Gentile. See Part V,
Chap. I, I.)
2. The Absolute as Intelligence.
(Bradley, Bosanquet, Creighton,
Hoernle, Paulsen, Windelband
and others.)
3. The Absolute as Intelligent Personal
Self or Will.
(Royce, Hocking, Leighton, Miss
Calkins, Pringle-Pattison and
others.)
I. Absolute Idealism.
II. Spiritual Pluralism.
1. Personalism.
(Bowne, Flewellyn, Brightman,
McConnell and others.)
2. Theism.
(Ward and others.)
III. Spiritual Monism. (Bergson and his followers.)
IV. Scientific Idealism or Neo-Kantianism. (Natorp, Cassirer, and
others.)
V. Platonic Idealism. (Dean Inge and others.)

THE METHODS OF IDEALISM
i. Does Idealism Have a Method?
THE reaction against idealism, which began near the
end of the nineteenth century and which has culmi-
nated in the development of realism and pragmatism, has
been motivated partly by the desire to make philosophy sci-
entific. The commonest charge of representatives of both
of these types of philosophy against idealism is that it lacks
a genuinely scientific method of procedure. Is this charge
valid?
One might get the impression that it is from what some
of the idealists themselves say, as well as from the failure
of many of them to state clearly what their method is. Fre-
quently such method as idealists have is kept in the back-
ground in the interest of the exposition of idealistic theory
and doctrine. This practice gives some substance to the
claim of critics that idealism is unmethodical, traditional,
and essentially a literary or parlor philosophy. But, so the
critics argue, since a sound philosophy should be progres-
sive, scientific, and methodical, idealism stands condemned
as essentially an antiquated philosophy. Now when as great
an idealist as Bosanquet can write: "I confess that all this
talk about method in philosophy seems to me rather foolish
and wearisome," this charge of the critics might be thought
to be valid. E. S. Brightman has rightly called attention to
the fact that many idealists attach too little importance to
method. His essay entitled "The Personalistic Method in
Philosophy" is a good account of method from the stand-
77
IDEALISM
point of personalism, and should help to correct the mis-
taken belief that idealists are unmethodical in their thinking.1
For this is undoubtedly a mistaken impression, and many
have been misled by it. Idealism has always had at least
one method and that is the dialectical method. Although
hoary with age this is a method still continually used by
leading idealists. Let us briefly consider this traditional
method.
2. The Dialectical Method
In Western Culture the first great monist was Par-
menides, a Greek philosopher who preceded and laid the
foundation for Plato. Now Parmenides and his pupil, Zeno,
employed a method of reasoning which was essentially dia-
lectical when they pointed out various contradictions that
are involved in various common-sense ideas. Let us think
especially of the idea of motion. The contradictions in this
idea are known as "Zeno's paradoxes"; and they have been
famous in philosophy ever since he formulated them. One
of them is known as the paradox of the flying arrow, and
another as that of Achilles and the tortoise, Achilles being
a hare. Zeno argued that an arrow can not move, because
it must either move in the place where it is or into the place
where it is not, and neither is possible. Similarly he argued
that a hare can never overtake a tortoise. Thus he sought
to prove that motion is impossible and that being is immov-
able. This is the first known use of the dialectical method,
which consisted at the beginning simply in pointing out con-
tradictions or paradoxes in ideas, and in treating any idea
as absurd that contained such contradictions. The method
was greatly extended in the Socratic method of question-
ing and answering as set forth in Plato's Dialogues. Both
Socrates and Plato employed this method to reach defini-
tions of concepts that are free from contradiction. They

pp. 368-380.
THE METHODS OF IDEALISM 79
first brought to light the ambiguity in a given definition and
then in another and another, but they usually either ended
by giving a good definition of the thing under consideration
or by leaving it to the reader to formulate one. Such a defi-
nition included the truth in the various rejected definitions
and excluded the error. Thus Socrates and Plato made the
dialectical method constructive.
Centuries later Hegel took up this ancient dialectical
method and perfected it as a fundamental metaphysical
method of reasoning. And it is his use of this method more
than any other single thing that has made him the "father
of modern idealism." He argued that every idea whatso-
ever, when its meaning is reflected upon, generates an op-
posite idea. These opposed ideas contain the two aspects of
the truth embodied in the idea which generated them, and
they must in turn be reconciled in another and higher idea,
—higher, that Is to say, in the sense of being freer from
contradiction than the original idea. For example, starting
with the idea of being, we are led to its opposite nonbeing;
and we find these reconciled in the idea of becoming. This
process of finding the positive and negative aspects of the
meaning of any given concept, and of reconciling these in
some higher concept, Hegel called the dialectical movement
of thought. It culminates in the Absolute Idea which is the
complete reconciliation of all contradictions that have
appeared in the process.2
In the Introduction to his Hegel Selections Loewenberg
takes the position that this method is essentially sound, but
that the philosophical system which Hegel constructed by
using this method is really fallacious. This at least proves
that the dialectical method of Hegel is still recognized by
a competent philosopher who is not an Hegelian. Now
when Bosanquet immediately added to the comment quoted
above, "I only know in philosophy one method; and that is
2 See the first selection from Hegel in my Anthology of Modern Philosophy,
especially the "Table of Categories."
IDEALISM
to expand all the relevant facts, taken together, into ideas
which approve themselves to thought as exhaustive and
self-consistent," he endorsed the dialectical method per-
fected by Hegel. And throughout his writings he simply
took this method for granted and continually applied it in
the solution of philosophical problems. Hence it is a serious
mistake for any critic or reader to conclude that idealism
has no method. He will make little progress in the study of
modern idealism who does not discover that all the writings
of idealists are more or less dominated by the Neo-Hege-
lian form of the dialectical method. It takes patient study
to discover this, but it is the secret to the understanding of
idealism.
Yet there is also another traditional method of idealism,
and that is the method of intuition. Let us now consider it.
3. The Method of Intuition
The method of intuition in one form or another has been
stressed by idealistic philosophers ever since Plato and Aris-
totle. The word intuition is used in different senses, but
common to all of them is the idea of direct or immediate
apprehension of truth as contrasted with the analytical or
discursive, step-by-step method of ordinary reflective think-
ing. Among ancient thinkers, Plotinus (205-270), the great
Neo-Platonist philosopher and mystic, insisted that rational
knowledge reached by discursive reasoning exists only for
the purpose of bringing the mind up to the point where it
can attain an insight into reality which transcends the sepa-
rate formulations of the discursive reason. St. Augustine,
and all Christian mystical philosophers, held a similar view.
In the Middle Ages St. Anselm (1033-1109) first used the
Latin term intuitus in the technical sense to mean imme-
diate knowledge of the present as such. He especially ap-
plied it to St. Paul's saying: "Now I know in part, but then
face to face," holding that intuitive knowledge means know-
ing face to face. Even Voltaire, the enemy of scholasticism,
has Cato say:
Oh, heavenly Truth,
Now I shall see thee bright and clear, not hid
As when life holds us in its deadening sleep.
Life is a dream! Death wakes us to the light!
Other scholastic philosophers used the term intuitive
knowledge as did St. Anselm. In his excellent biography of
Descartes, Chevalier has proved conclusively that the great
founder of modern philosophy and discoverer of analytical
geometry, employed this method along with rational or
discursive reasoning., Pascal said: "The heart hath its
reasons which the reason knoweth not." Spinoza spoke of a
third type of knowledge above perceptual and conceptual
knowledge, calling it scientia intuitiva, and to him this was
the immediate intuition of the whole of reality or the in-
tellectual love of God. Fichte and Schelling, the great Ger-
man contemporaries of Hegel, especially stressed intuition
as a method of knowing.
Recently the distinguished French philosopher and win-
ner of a Nobel prize for literature, Henri Bergson, has
come out strongly in defense of intuitive knowledge on the
ground that it gives a far deeper and truer insight into the
nature of reality than does the analytical method of science.
He defines intuition as "instinct that has become disinter-
ested, self-conscious, capable of reflecting upon its object
and of enlarging it indefinitely." Intuition makes good the
defects in intelligence, which is really only a tool for dealing
with the more solid parts of reality. Intuition gives us the
inner and vital soul of reality. Although human beings use
intellectual apprehension or discursive reasoning far more
than they-use intuition, the latter always functions when
our deepest interests are involved. "On our personality, our
liberty, on the place we occupy in the whole of nature,
on our origin and, perhaps, also on our destiny, it throws
IDEALISM
a light feeble and vacillating, but which none the less
pierces the darkness of the night in which the intellect
leaves us." 2 We must build philosophy on science, but we
must also build it upon our untutored and tutored in-
tuitions, using them as gateways to the inner essence of
the real. Today no one can hope to understand idealism
who neglects its use of the method of intuition as a way of
attaining philosophic truth.
4. The Method of Intensive Concretion
Let us now attempt to formulate as the essential method
of idealism the method of intensive concretion, building it
out of the dialectical method and the intuitive method. I
call this method the method of intensive concretion, in order
to contrast it as sharply as possible with the method of ex-
tensive abstraction of realism, which is expounded in Part
III, Chapter II.
The word intensive is used here in much the same sense
as it is used in logic in the doctrine of the intension of a
logical term. One gives the intension of a term when he
lists all of the various elements or factors entering into
the constitution of any example of that term. Using the
term intensive in this sense, the metaphysical reality of any
entity whatsoever includes all of its qualities, relations or
aspects, no matter what they may be or how far they may
be separated in space or time. The intensive characteristics
in their completeness and depth, and seen in relation to each
other, is the aspect of the method which the word intensive
would convey. This might be expressed as viewing the as-
pects of a thing synoptically. The word concretion em-
phasizes particularity and uniqueness. Every entity has just
as much reality as it possesses uniqueness. The word con-
cretion is used to signify that the intensive qualities are
fused together in a unique manner, so as to constitute an
* Henri Bergson: Creative Evolution, p. 268, translated by A. Mitchell
(Holt).
individuality or a concrete whole. Thus the method of in-
tensive concretion seeks the concrete whole, which unifies
the seemingly irreconcilable aspects of a thing. This con-
crete whole is the metaphysical reality of that particular
thing. We may, therefore, refer to the realities reached by
the method of intensive concretion as concrete universal*
or implicative systems. These are the irreducible units of
reality when reality is metaphysically, rather than biologi-
cally or physically, conceived.
Note that this method assumes reality, in the sense of
metaphysics, to be constituted of concrete universals. It
denies at the outset that there are any isolated and un-
related "hard atoms" or "soft souls." To be at all is to be
a synthesis of aspects or qualities. The absolutely simple
is inconceivable. Whatever has any reality is held together
with something else so as to form a synthetic whole. Pure
identity and pure difference are unthinkable. Identity in dif-
ference or concrete universality is the essential structure of
any entity that can claim any metaphysical reality whatso-
ever.
The problem with which every thinker is confronted is
that of discovering the particular concrete universal to
which any given aspect of experience belongs. He must
follow the clues of the given aspect until he is led to enough
other aspects to enable him to discern the pattern to which
this and its related aspects belong. He must start with
the assumption that there is such a pattern and that his
mind is capable of discovering it. And he must use intuition
and feel his way into the essence of this concrete whole as
well as think his way into it. But the important point about
the method of intensive concretion is its emphasis upon
seeing all of the appearances or aspects in relation to a per-
vading identity which unifies them so that together they
form, not a mere aggregation or totality, but a concrete
universal.
An example will make this clearer. What is the meta-
IDEALISM
physical reality of Lindbergh's flight from New York to
Paris? From a common-sense viewpoint this is an epoch-
making event in the history of aviation. What would an
application of the method of intensive concretion yield as
the metaphysical reality of this actual event, which every
well-informed person would undoubtedly have to admit had
occurred?
Many physical qualities, or whatever physicists would
resolve physical qualities into, formed part of this event.
There was the airplane, the Spirit of St. Louis, with its
elaborate and precise mechanism, the materials out of which
plane and motor were constructed. Here, too, belong the
fuel and the oil the motor used, the food Lindbergh ate,
the clothes he wore, his physical body, and the atmospheric
and climatic conditions he met on the journey, the landing
field from which he made his take-off and the one where
he landed, and the compasses and other instruments he used
to chart his course. Using recent terminology we may call
all of these aspects of Lindbergh's flight the macroscopic
physical entities of this metaphysical reality or concrete
universal. But we may accept the physico-chemical theory
that all these gross objects were composed of swarming
multitudes, unnumbered and innumerable, of protons and
electrons in various orbits of motion. Yet these were unified
in one great system of motion towards Paris, controlled
by the lone pilot. The method of intensive concretion would
say that the metaphysical reality of Lindbergh's flight
included all of these microscopic entities as well as the
macroscopic.
Biological and physiological factors were also involved,
which were both macroscopic and microscopic. The food the
pilot ate was assimilated by his stomach and was distrib-
uted through his body by the incessant beating of his heart.
His nerves, brain, and other bodily organs had to be func-
tioning perfectly. Only a being vibrant with life could have
made such a flight. And who knows how many other living
organisms were connected in one way or another with this
flight? Yet all of these macroscopic biological and physio-
logical objects may be analyzed by scientists into innumer-
able microscopic entities. Howsoever many there were of
both macroscopic and microscopic biological and physio-
logical factors involved in the making of this flight, all
are included in its metaphysical reality, according to the
method of intensive concretion.
The spatio-temporal relations involved are obvious
enough. The duration and distance traversed, the height
the plane was in the sky, the speed with which it traveled,
these and all other spatio-temporal aspects are part of the
metaphysical reality of that historic flight. And the values
involved can not be ignored. The cost of the airplane, and
of the fuel, oil, and food, and of the ticket Lindbergh pur-
chased to bring him home, the prize money he won, the in-
crease in the value of airplane stocks—these economic values
are unquestionably a part of the metaphysical reality of
that flight. But so also are the aesthetic and moral values
created by it. A hero for countless youths to admire and to
imitate emerged at the end of the flight. All of these values
connected with this flight are a part of its reality according
to the method of intensive concretion. The mental factors
are even more important. The mind of Lindbergh which
conceived this particular flight, the careful plans he made
and carried out in detail, the consummate skill acquired
through years of assiduous practice, the technical knowledge
of aeronautics, the memories he yet retains—all of these and
all other mental factors are to be included in the meta-
physical reality of that flight. Nor can the social factors
be omitted. The crowd of people who saw Lindbergh take
to the air and those who saw him emerge from the sky, the
spontaneous acclaim of an astounded humanity—all these
and other social factors are a part of the metaphysical real-
ity of that memorable flight, according to the method of
intensive concretion.
IDEALISM
Yet what would all of these diverse factors be without
the unity which holds them together? Idealism holds that
there is such an ideal order-system, and that it is this con-
crete universal, of which all of the above-mentioned factors
are constituents, which is the metaphysical reality of Lind-
bergh's flight. This whole is not a sensuous object. No one
can touch it or see it or hear it or smell it or taste it or
discover it with the sense of equilibrium or any other "sixth
sense," known or unknown. It is not a spatio-temporal type
of object. Spatio-temporal ingredients are included in it; but
when we call it merely an event in aviation, we are ignoring
many other elements that are important and taking its
temporal character alone as a clue to its reality. As a con-
crete universal its event-character is only one of its aspects.
And the same must be said of every other aspect. Every
physical and mechanical factor, every biological and physio-
logical factor, every spiritual and social factor is to be re-
garded as an intensive quality of this concrete whole and is
never to be identified with this whole itself. The meta-
physical reality cannot be identified with any single aspect
nor with any group of aspects nor with any collection of
aspects constituted by selections from each group, just
because it can only be identified with the totality of all
aspects of all groups, conceived of as unified into a concrete
whole rather than as a mere aggregation or totality. To
discover this whole is to comprehend Lindbergh's flight as a
metaphysical reality in distinction from comprehending it
as an event in the history of aviation. The method of in-
tensive concretion is a method of sweeping into one dy-
namic and organic whole all of the various elements belong-
ing to that whole, and of holding this unified and ideal
order-system to be the ultimate reality. To the objection
that such a concrete universal is a myth or figment of the
philosopher's imagination the idealist would reply that it
is embodied in every one of its aspects, since we recognize
each of them to be an aspect only because we have a grip
upon the concrete universal to which it belongs. Knowing
them as aspects or fragments implies a knowledge of the
concrete whole of which they are fragments. And this is an
irrefutable proof that concrete universals are real.
Many other names have been given to the method of
idealism besides that of intensive concretion. Bradley re-
fers to it as the principle of identity in difference, the
method of finding the whole which is constituted by a per-
vading identity inherent in manifold differences. Bosanquet
refers to it as the principle of individuality and value, and
also as the principle of the concrete universal and of self-
relatedness. Royce refers to it as interpretation. Hoernle
calls it the synoptic method. But all idealists agree that the
essence of the real is always that whole which includes all
of the appearances or aspects of a thing. And they also
agree that we must both think and feel our way into that
whole. We must use the rigorous dialectical method of
finding and reconciling contradictions, but we must supple-
ment this with intuitive insight.
IDEALISM'S SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF
KNOWLEDGE AND EXISTENCE
i. The Levels Theory of Reality
THE essence of the idealistic theory of existence is the
levels theory of reality. This theory has recently been
reformulated; but it is as old as idealism, or at least as old
as the Dialogues of Plato and the writings of Aristotle.
When Plato in the Symposium distinguished different levels
of the experience of beauty, the highest being the love of
the absolute idea or form of beauty, he was stating this
theory. It is also the central idea in his theory that the ideas
are arranged in an hierarchy, with the idea of good at the
top. And when Aristotle distinguished the vegetative or
nutritive soul of plants from the sensitive soul of animals,
and both from the rational soul of man, holding that higher
souls contained the capacities of the lower, he was also
stating this levels theory. And it was also the essence of his
notion that reality is a gradual development from poten-
tiality to actuality, in which form comes more and more to
regulate and to dominate matter. Plotinus elaborated
the theory in his doctrine that each of the lower levels of
being emanates from God. Through his influence the doc-
trine became the essence of the early Christian philosophy
and of practically all of the various philosophies of the
Middle Ages—Christian, Jewish and Arabian. We find it
especially in Scotus Erigena, the first great scholastic, and in
all of the great Christian mystics. We find it permeating the
Jewish Cabala, which was the Jewish mystical philosophy of
the Middle Ages. And we find it in Arabian Mediaeval phi-

losophy, especially in the writings of Averroes, Avicenna,
and Al-Gazali. Bruno and Spinoza adapted this levels
theory to the thought of their ages, as did Hegel to the
thought of the early nineteenth century. Since the rise of
the theory of evolution the doctrine has again been re-
stated in terms of that concept, notably by Bergson. But
from the dawn of idealism to this hour there has been a
levels theory of reality, and this still remains the very in-
most essence of idealistic metaphysics.
According to this theory the way to understand reality
is not to treat it as beginning and ending nor as evolving
in a straight linear direction only. We must rather treat
it as consisting of a series of levels the higher of which in-
cludes the lower. We may look at each level genetically, if
we like, and treat each as emerging out of the lower level
which serves as its structural basis. But we may also treat
all levels as existing simultaneously, and we may rise from
one level to another by means of rational reflection and in-
tuition. Reality is like a New York skyscraper. We have to
use an elevator to ascend from one level to another. Berg-
son argued that the only elevator by which we can make this
ascent is intuition, and in taking this position he was not
far from Plato and Plotinus. But even though we admit
that intuition is the express elevator, still there is the slower
moving freight elevator of the discursive reason. Most
idealists hold that intuition and discursive reasoning are
both legitimate methods of ascending from one level of
reality to another, and, as we shall see later, some hold that
there is a third way of knowing called interpretation.
The title of R. F. A. Hoernle's book, Matter, Life, Mind,
and God suggests what the chief levels of reality are. We
may group matter and life together as forming what is
usually called Nature, when that word is used to mean pre-
human nature. And we must think of mind as being a unity
of the individual and of the social mind. We must also
think of God as being above all of the other levels and as
go
IDEALISM
including them all. In other words, the basic principle of
the theory of reality of all idealism is that we can explain
the lower by including it in the higher but that we can never
explain the higher by reducing it to the lower, or by de-
veloping a metaphysics in terms of a lower level which pre-
cludes the possibility of acknowledging the higher. In some
form or other this principle is recognized by all idealists
and is the central postulate of all idealism. It follows that
idealism reaches a single, all-inclusive whole as the high-
est reality. We may call this God, or the Absolute, or simply
Reality, depending upon the way it is interpreted by special
idealists. But generally speaking all idealists would agree
that we reach a complete metaphysical definition of the
reality of anything whatsoever only when we say what it is
at every level, which means saying what it is at the level
of reality as a whole, since that level includes the lower
ones. Bradley and Bosanquet state this principle when they
say that any judgment about any particular thing always
has as its ultimate subject Reality as a whole, so that we
might restate every judgment: Reality is such that so and
so is true. The general assumption on which the levels
theory rests is that Reality is a rational and self-consistent
whole.
2. Matter and Life
The idealist is willing to let the physicists and chemists
say what matter is provided they do not then proceed to
reduce everything else in the universe to that level. And
he is willing to let the biologist say what life is provided
he does not then forthwith proceed to reduce all other levels
of reality to that of biological organisms. No idealist is
especially concerned over the effects of the Einstein theory
of relativity, nor over the effects of the Mendelian theory
of heredity, on metaphysics. But every idealist is very much
concerned over those philosophical theories of the universe,
which, basing themselves on the new physics or the new
biology, proceed to level everything down to what physics
and biology call real. Generally speaking this is the attitude
of idealists towards the existences dealt with in the natural
sciences, physics, chemistry and biology, and the branches
of human knowledge derived from them or obtained by
combining them.
How then does the idealist conceive of matter ? He thinks
that the word is highly ambiguous. Hoernle distinguishes
four primary meanings, which are sufficient to show how
ambiguous the term is, as well as the characteristic attitude
of idealists towards this level of reality. But all of these
meanings arise from the "central situation": "physics,
as an empirical science, finds its subject-matter within
the field of what we perceive by our senses." In other words,
physics abstracts out of sense data all mental relations and
aspects and constructs a world of nature that is, to use the
expression of Whitehead, "closed to mind." Consequently
four meanings of matter arise: (i) Matter is often taken
to mean whatever is opposed to mind or spirit. (ii) Matter
taken as equivalent to the material world is a general name
for the totality of all normal sense objects—chairs,
houses, rocks, mountains, valleys, clouds, seas and what
not, in contrast to dreams, ghosts and such-like fantasies.
Such sense-objects are what constitute gross matter or
macroscopic physical reality, and hence this may be taken
as the common-sense conception of matter. (iii) But to the
scientist, and to those who have absorbed scientific ideas,
matter means atoms and molecules, protons and electrons,
entropy and inertia and whatever other entities may be
postulated by scientists to explain what we perceive. (iv)
Matter may be taken to mean some single and imperceptible
substance or cause of what is perceived. It was this fourth
sense of the word which Berkeley labored so hard to re-
fute with his subjective idealism or mentalism. As a mat-
ter of fact no philosopher believes it today. As Broad says:
"Any competent philosopher nowadays, whether he asserts
92
IDEALISM
or denies the independent existence of matter, is asserting
or denying something far more subtle and far better ana-
lyzed than anything which Berkeley or Descartes would
have understood by the same form of words." From the
standpoint of idealism matter is the lowest level of reality
dealt with in physics and chemistry, the elements of which
are well-known and the properties of which are extremely
pervasive. It is partly composed of macroscopic and partly
of microscopic entities. There is no fundamental opposition
between matter and mind, but matter is reached by ab-
stracting away the organic and mental factors of the field of
perception. This is a legitimate abstraction if it is recog-
nized as an abstraction, but it becomes illegitimate when it is
made the only reality and all else is reduced to it, as is done
in all forms of naturalistic metaphysics.
Now how does the idealist conceive of life? Does living
matter contain unique properties, or, at least, functions,
which justify us in treating it as a distinct level of reality
higher than matter as just discussed? If so, is this distinction
absolute, or does matter gradually emerge into life? Here
idealists differ. Some are vitalists, who hold that life is
original and unique. Others hold that there is a gradual
emergence of life and that matter is temporally prior. But
both groups agree that life is not the highest level of reality,
and that a biological naturalism is based upon just as vicious
an abstraction as a physical naturalism. As Wheeler has
pointed out, there are three groups of extremists among the
interpreters of biological phenomena—the mystery-mon-
gers, by which phrase he means those vitalists who treat
life as a mysterious force, sometimes called entelechy,
within each organism; the simplicists, who reduce all life
to the simplicity of a one-celled organism and regard this
as essentially constituted by physico-chemical processes;
and the humanizers, who read human qualities and pur-
poses into animals of the simplest type. To the idealist
all of these biological interpretations of life are fallacious
because they are one-sided. He seeks a conception of living
beings which has room in it for all forms of life and which
will, at the same time, do justice to the uniqueness of living,
as contrasted with purely physical, matter. Such a concept
may be found in J. S. Haldane's conception of a living
being as "an active autonomous whole," or in General
Smuts's concept of holism. When this is generalized we get
Bergson's elan vital or vital impetus theory of life. (See
Part V, Chaps. I, II, below).
We cannot here enter into the details of the contro-
versy between mechanism and teleology in biology. Both
of these terms are highly ambiguous; but, in general,
mechanism is the extreme view which Wheeler attributes
to the simplicists. It reduces life to physico-chemical proc-
esses and thereby explains the living with the concepts of
physics and chemistry. On the other hand, teleology insists
that living organisms manifest the characteristic of direct-
ing their actions towards an end, although a teleologist need
not think of this end as equivalent to a conscious purpose.
Most idealists are teleologists in some sense of that much
abused word. Yet no idealist would identify the level of
life with the whole of reality, any more than he would
identify the level of matter with the whole.
3. Mind or the Social Order
That organisms capable of a civilized culture represent a
higher level of reality than life is a basic tenet of idealism.
How are we to conceive of this level? Leaving out of con-
sideration the much debated, but purely academic, question
of whether individual or social mind is more fundamental,
let us briefly sketch the idealistic theory of what culture or
the social mind as a whole is. This whole of human society
consists fundamentally of three distinct orders. In the first
place there is the public order based upon man's ambition.
This order is composed of the basic institution which organ-
izes the competitive interests of men into a single whole,
»'
94
IDEALISM
namely, the political state. But within the political state
there are various other institutions which help to form the
public order, such as all branches of government, federal,
state and local, all military organizations, all economic and
industrial organizations, and all trade groups. All these to-
gether give to men a scope for the realization of their
ambitions, and together they constitute the public order.
But in the second place, there is the private order, which is
built upon love. The fundamental institution of this order is
the family, for it is within the family that man finds the
fullest scope for the realization of love. Sex-love, parental
love, and filial love all reach their highest expression within
and through the institution of the monogamous family.
But all friendship groups, and social fraternities, and other
human associations which develop friendliness among men
and women and boys and girls form this private order. In
normal life each individual's daily activities alternate be-
tween these two orders. Man goes out into the public order
to do his work, but he returns to the private order for re-
cuperation and recreation. He cannot find happiness if he
restricts his activities to one of these orders and entirely
disregards the other. Participation in both is essential to
self-development and to self-realization.
Yet both of these orders presuppose the reality of an-
other which, for want of a better name, we may call the
third order. The word third is misleading here because it
implies that this order is dependent upon the other two.
But the truth is that it was originally the only order and
that the other two have split off from it. And today it still
remains the ultimate source of the stability of the other two
orders. This third order is based upon reverence for, and
appreciation of, the higher cultural values, and its basic
institutions are religion, art, science, and philosophy. It
transcends the distinction between the public order and the
private order, and gives to every human being a scope for
those creative energies which do not find adequate oppor-
tunity for expression in either of those orders. Yet it is the
family and the state which foster culture and make it pos-
sible. And they do this because they get from culture the
strength and vitality which maintains them. Thus the human
level of reality culminates in making man a member of a
community of creative minds working for the conservation
and enrichment, as well as for the widest possible distribu-
tion, of culture.1
What is the distant goal of this human and cultural level
of reality? Fichte well expressed this when he said that it
will be reached only when "the existing culture of every age
shall have been diffused over the whole inhabited globe, and
our race become capable of the most unlimited intercom-
munication with itself." And "when that final point shall
have been attained, when every useful discovery made at
one end of the earth shall be at once made known and com-
municated to all the rest, then, without further interrup-
tion, without halt or regress, with united strength and
equal step, humanity shall move onward to a higher culture,
of which we can at present form no conception." 2 Yet no
idealist would identify this cultural level of reality with the"
whole of reality. There is, there must be, a still higher level
which gives meaning to the cultural level. Fichte went on
from the passage quoted above to insist upon this, and
every idealist follows him in this. That higher level is a
transcendental level in the sense that it is non-finite, but
nevertheless it includes all that is real in the levels below it.
4. God or the Transcendental Level of Reality ~
If we call this highest level God, we are faced with a
difficulty. The term God has a popular anthropomorphic
meaning which it gets from mass religion. When a phi-
losopher uses this word, he never means by it what, for

Nature and Its Remaking, 2nd ed., Part VI (Yale Press).

IDEALISM
example, any naive person would mean by it. This fact
must be especially stressed because the critics of idealism
often leave the impression that idealism holds to the idea
of God of the man in the street. Now an idealist may well
rejoice in the fact that there is a popular idea of God,
since it proves that he is not really going against common
sense when he asserts that there is a level of reality above,
yet inclusive of, the human. But no idea of God of any
idealist is to be identified with the vague and crude concep-
tion of the unreflective.
As a matter of fact many idealists do not even like to use
the word God. It carries with it the idea of personality,
which some idealists regard as too human an idea to use in
referring to the highest level of reality. Moreover, all
idealists recognize that this highest level of reality is most
intricate and rich, and that any single characterization of
it is entirely inadequate. And it may also be said that all
idealists recognize that this level of deity is composed of
other levels. God is conceived of as a Spirit immanent in
history—the Absolute Spirit. This is especially the view of
Croce and his British disciple, J. A. Smith. Such idealists
are inclined to deny that God is anything else but the im-
manent reason that pervades all nature and manifests itself
in the innumerable forms and creations of the other levels,
culminating in culture. But God is also conceived of as
Perfection—that all-inclusive, self-consistent whole in which
all contradictions are reconciled in Truth, all evils trans-
muted into Good, and all ugliness harmonized in Beauty.
Such idealists treat God as a transcendent and perfect be-
ing, at the same time that they regard Him as immanent in
history and in cosmic and organic evolutionary processes.
But other idealists ask how immanence and transcendence
can co-exist in deity unless both are subordinated to the
idea of divine (not human) personality. Accordingly such
idealists retain both immanence and transcendence as as-
pects of the divine nature, but they regard both as unified
in the divine personality. To them God is the unified total-
ity of all spiritual values, and as such He is an infinite Per- **
son, inclusive of all reality. Human persons form a society
of unique persons within the personality of God. Although
this has been called spiritual pluralism, it should be espe-
cially noted that it is more monistic than it is pluralistic,
since it especially stresses the unity of persons in God.
5. Interpretation as a Theory of Knowledge
Having briefly summarized the idealistic levels theory of
reality, we may now turn to the idealistic theory of the way
we know these levels and the separate objects peculiar to
each level. There are many statements of the idealistic
theory of knowledge, and there are important differences
among them. The group known as personalists, or at least
some of them, hold to epistemological dualism, treating
human ideas as representative of some extra-mental reality.
Others hold to epistemological monism, identifying ideas
with their objects or meanings. It is not here possible to
develop the various forms of idealistic theory of knowl-
edge. Let us rather expound a theory which aims to do jus-
tice to both of the above-mentioned points of view, namely,
Josiah Royce's theory of interpretation. This theory was
the last, and in some respects the greatest, contribution
which Royce made to idealism. It is set forth in his Prob-
lems of Christianity, Vol. II, but it appears in a somewhat
later form in his article entitled Mind in Hastings's En-
cyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, an article which was
written during the last year of Royce's life.
The familiar distinction between perception and concep—
tion—a distinction which has haunted philosophy ever since
Kant made his famous statement that perceptions with-
out conceptions are blind, but conceptions without percep-
tions are empty, and which has reappeared in somewhat dif-
ferent form in recent philosophy under the names "knowl-
edge by acquaintance" and "knowledge by description"—is
IDEALISM
Royce's starting point. He shows that neither of these cog-
nitive processes is ever found in absolute purity, but that
they are always found together. And he says that it is "an
extraordinary example of a failure to reflect in a thorough-
going way upon the process of knowledge that until re-
cently the third type of cognitive process to which we want
next to refer has been neglected, although every one is con-
stantly engaged in using and in exemplifying it." This third
type Royce calls interpretation. A good illustration of it is
understanding a word or sign which some one uses. Suppose
some one cries "Fire I" To understand this I must hear the
cry. That is the perceptual element. My existing conceptual
knowledge of what fire is,, is the conceptual element. But I
do not understand the cry "Fire!" unless I interpret the
sign to mean an idea different from mine and which I refer
to a mind in some way distinct from mine. Now how do we
know these minds that are in some way distinct from our
own? We come to know them just by this process of "inter-
preting the signs which these minds give us of their pres-
ence." Charles S. Peirce was the first to call this process
by the name interpretation, and Royce says that he took the
term from Peirce.
Now Royce explicitly connects this conception of inter-
pretation with the levels theory of reality when he goes on
to say that the natural objects of perception are sense data
and feelings; and that those of conception are general
scientific categories, for example, such mathematical and
logical concepts as number, identity, et cetera; but that those
of interpretation are "signs which express the meaning of
some mind," which mind may be that of the interpreter him-
self. To treat self-knowledge and knowledge of the minds
of others as direct perception or intuition, as Bergson and
some other philosophers do, is to use a type of cognitive
process especially designed for the lowest level of reality to
reach a knowledge of the higher levels. When we do this we
run the risk of losing the uniqueness of the higher levels,
and we tend to reduce them to the lower level to which per-
ception as a cognitive process is especially suited. Like per-
ception and conception, interpretation is subject to error.
But our own minds are enlarged by the process of interpret-
ing the signs given to us by other minds. And it is essentially
by this cognitive process that we know the upper levels—
self, society, and God. In his article entitled Mind Royce
makes this perfectly clear in the following significant pas-
sage: "In dealing with other minds, I am constantly enlarg-
ing my own mind by getting new interpretations, both of
myself and of my neighbor's life. The contrasts, surprises,
conflicts, and puzzles which these new ideas present to me
show me that in dealing with them I am dealing with what
in some respects is not my own mind. The coherence of the
whole system of interpretations, ideas, plans, and purposes
shows me just as positively that I am dealing with a mind, «'
i.e., with something which through these expressions con-
stantly interprets itself, while, as I deal with it, I in turn
constantly interpret it, and even in and through this very
process interpret myself. It will and must be observed that
this Alter, with which I have to deal, both in reflecting
on my own mind and in seeking for new light from my
neighbor, is never a merely single or separable or merely
detached or isolated individual, but is always a being which
is the nature of a community, a 'many in one' and a 'one in
many'." And he concludes: "Only in terms of a theory of
the threefold process of knowledge can we hope fully to ex-
press what is meant by that form of idealism which views
the world as 'the process of the Spirit' and as containing its
own interpretation and its own interpreter." 3 Here, then,
we have a highly original and modern statement of the
idealistic theory of knowledge, and one that is definitely re-
lated to the idealistic theory of levels.

IDEALISM'S SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF
TRUTH AND ERROR
i. General Statement of the Problem
THE problem of truth and error is one of the most
complicated problems in philosophy, but it is quite
generally admitted that two different questions that are
often confused must be kept distinct. One of these is the
age-old question of Pilate: What is truth? What consti-
tutes the essential nature of truth? What is the definition
of truth? To make this question sharp and precise some
writers prefer to use the abstract term trueness, and they
attempt to tell what trueness is. The other question con-
cerns specific beliefs, asking what ones are true and what
ones false. Given definite and particular beliefs or state-
ments, judgments or propositions, which of them are true
and which are false? In attempting to answer this question
philosophers are led to formulate tests, or, as they are more
frequently called, criteria of truth.
Among philosophers there are four theories of the na-
ture of truth or trueness which have been and still are
especially significant. They are (i) the coherence theory,
(ii) the correspondence or (in some of its forms) the copy
theory, (iii) the pragmatist theory and (iv) the intuition-
ist theory or the theory of self-evidence. Now when a phi-
losopher adopts one of these theories to answer the first
question, he is very likely to use the principle of one or
more of the others as criteria of truth, thus using them to
answer the second question. This fact often makes philo-
sophic discussions of truth especially difficult to unravel.
100
THE PROBLEM OF TRUTH AND ERROR 101
The student should always ask which theory is being made
the definition of trueness, and which principles are being
used merely as criteria of the truth of specific beliefs.
There are certain requirements which any theory of
truth must meet if it is to be adequate. Philosophers usually
state these requirements so that they will be most favorable
to their own theory. Since idealism advocates the coher-
ence theory of truth, let us state these requirements as ad-
vocates of that theory would state them. (i) The theory
of truth we adopt must be capable of truth as judged by
its own standard. (ii) Truth must be so defined that it
will be possible to discover what specific beliefs are true.
Both of these requirements are frequently violated. But a
theory of truth which is not capable of being true on its own
principle would thereby imply a kind of truth not provided
for in the theory. And what is the sense of defining truth
in such a way that you never can tell when you have it? It
would be far better to adopt a purely sceptical attitude and
refrain from theorizing. Yet it is possible to define truth in
such a way that no one ever could know whether any par-
ticular belief is true or false; in fact this has actually been
done. (iii) Our definition of trueness must be such that the
principle used in it can also be used to define falsity. (iv)
Our definition of truth must be such that it will be possible
to explain how a specific belief can be held true at one time
and false at another. In other words, our theory of truth
must take account of the so-called relativity of truth, and it
must specify wherein this relativity consists. With these re-
quirements of a theory of truth in mind, let us examine in
some detail the coherence theory of truth.
2. The Simplest Form of the Coherence Theory
In its simplest form the coherence theory says that any
proposition is true which is consistent with other accepted
propositions or other propositions that are known to be
true. This theory is involved in the so-called principle of
IDEALISM
implication: Any proposition that is implied by a true prop-
osition is true. Let us call this the formal consistency theory
of truth, to distinguish it from a form of the coherence
theory which will be considered presently. Now suppose
that we know certain definitions and axioms of geometry
to be true. Then we can say that the theorems we prove
by means of these definitions and axioms are true, by
showing that they are implied in and are consistent with
them. Thus the truth of the Pythagorean theorem, that the
square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal
to the sum of the squares on the other two sides, is con-
stituted by its consistency with the rest of Euclidean Geom-
etry on which it is based. We can think of this consistency
as being confined to a specific body of knowledge such as
Euclidean Geometry or Arithmetic, or we may extend it to
a wide field such as the whole of mathematics, or we may
apply it to the whole system of Formal Logic. In the
latter case certain formal laws of thought are held
to be the underlying axioms on which the whole system
rests. Consistency with these laws is what is supposed to
constitute truth. How many basic laws of thought are there?
On this question logicians are not in accord. In the tradi-
tional Aristotelian Logic three are recognized, namely,
the law of contradiction, the law of identity and the law of
excluded middle. The law of identity says: A is A or a
thing must be identical with itself. The law of contradic-
tion says: A cannot be both A and Non-A at the same time
or a thing can never be identical with itself and with its
opposite at the same time. And the law of excluded middle
says every object of thought must be either A or Non-A
and that there can be no middle ground. The great German
philosopher, Leibniz, added to these laws his famous law
of sufficient reason, that there must be a sufficient reason
why A is A or Non-A, as the case may be. The idealistic
logicians are inclined to reduce all of these laws to the
principle of consistency. So much for the traditional state-
ment of the laws of thought.
Let us now express the formal consistency theory of
truth differently, and less traditionally, by distinguishing be-
tween a belief and a proposition. When a belief is true we
may call this true opinion because there is a relation to the
believer involved. But when a proposition is true, no rela-
tion to a believer is implied. Hence, as far as propositions
are concerned, both truth and falsity are equally objective
and equally purely formal. Logic lays down four defining
principles to explain what propositions are: (i) Every prop-
osition having a precise and definite meaning is true or
false and cannot be both. (ii) To every proposition there
corresponds another that is its contradictory or opposite.
(iii) In general the relation between contradictory propo-
sitions is reciprocal or "symmetrical" in the logical sense of
that word. (iv) Given any two contradictory propositions,
one is true and the other is false. Now if we take proposi-
tions collectively, that is to say as forming a class or sys-
tem, the relations of truth and falsity are formally insep-
arable, since in the class of all propositions there are just
as many true as there are false ones. Such a system, how-
ever, is an abstraction from the real world. Any particular
proposition that is believed need not have an opposite that
is believed. But when a proposition that is believed to be true
is actually false, our belief is erroneous. Consequently error
is subjective and a matter of belief, whereas falsity is ob-
jective and a matter of formal logical relation between
opposite or contradictory propositions.
This formal consistency theory of truth is a form of the
coherence theory which is generally accepted, at least as
a test or criterion of truth. But the question has to be asked,
What truth is constituted by the relation of formal consist-
ency? For in this theory the original defining principles, or
laws of thought, or whatever other "primitive proposi-
tions" are used, are not true because of their consistency
with what is obtained from them. There is only a one-way
consistency. Consequently this theory is only able to define
the truth of the derivative or implied propositions in terms
of consistency. It has to take the basic laws on which the
derivative propositions are based as self-evident or axio-
matic. But that presupposes the intuitive theory of truth.
Hence, as Royce used to say repeatedly in his lectures on
logic, self-evidence is a dangerous principle. And it is espe-
cially dangerous for an advocate of the coherence theory
of truth, since it forces him to hold that there are two
essentially different kinds of trueness, only one of which is
constituted by coherence. Consequently this simplest form
of the coherence theory is inadequate. This every idealist
freely admits.
3. Metaphysical Forms of the Coherence Theory
The only way out of the root difficulty in the formal
consistency theory of truth is to make the consistency be-
tween primitive propositions and derivative propositions
reciprocal. We must take the position that the derived
propositions are true because of their consistency with the
primitive propositions, and that the latter are true because
they are consistent with what is derived from them. This
leads us to the idealistic principle of consistency according
to which truth is a reciprocally consistent system of prop-
ositions, each of which gets its truth from the whole sys-
tem. And such an internally consistent system our body of
human knowledge ever strives to become. But what guides
this struggle of knowledge in becoming wholly self-consist-
ent? The answer which idealists give to this important ques-
tion is the all-inclusive and self-consistent whole of reality.
And they add that it is the consistency of our human beliefs
with that whole which makes them true when they are
true. Thus purely formal consistency such as one might get
in a system of suppositions is abandoned and coherence with
reality is made the essence of truth. It is this fact which
justifies calling this a metaphysical form of the coherence
theory. Whoever holds that "judgment must transcend sup-
position," whoever appeals to the self-consistent whole of
reality to establish the truth of any belief, whoever adopts -'
the metaphysical form of the coherence theory, thereby
becomes anidealist. No other group of philosophers accepts
a metaphysical doctrine of coherence, but idealists are in
general agreement that this is the real meaning of the
coherence theory.
This metaphysical form of the coherence theory always
has been the theory of truth implicit in idealism. It is to be
found in Plato. In Book I of the Republic he argues from
abstract premises to abstract conclusions about justice. But
when he undertakes in the rest of the dialogue to work
out his own definition of justice he uses the conception of
the whole social organism and asks what conception of jus-
tice is forced upon us by the nature of that whole. And there
are other evidences that Plato reasoned from the nature of
the whole to the truth of particular propositions, and held"
that their truth is constituted by their relation to the whole.
Bosanquet points out that the germ of the coherence theory
is to be found in Bishop Butler's writings. The Bishop
argued that "every work both of nature and of art is a
system." Understanding a thing consists in discovering "the
idea of a system, economy, or constitution of any particular
nature, or particular anything." Further he said that such
a system "is an one or whole made up of several parts,
but yet, that the several parts even considered as a whole
do not complete the idea, unless in the notion of a whole
you include the relations and respects which those parts
have to each other." 1 This is a highly significant passage
because it shows that the coherence idea existed early in the
history of British philosophy and prior to the development
of the coherence theory in Germany. For that theory domi-

IDEALISM
nates the writings of the great German philosophers,
Fichte, Schelling and Hegel. In the Preface to his Phd-
nomenologie (Phenomenology of Spirit) Hegel enunci-
ated the famous principle, Das Wahre ist das Ganze, the
truth is the whole. From the German idealists this theory
passed to the British Neo-Hegelians—the two Cairds, T.
H. Green, F. H. Bradley, J. E. McTaggart, Bernard
Bosanquet, and others. Josiah Royce took the coherence
« theory from Hegel and developed it in a unique way in this
country, just as the British Neo-Hegelians did in England.
Croce did the same in Italy, and Cousin and others in
France. As a result the coherence theory has become the
most generally accepted theory of truth among idealists of
all the countries of Western Civilization.
In his article entitled Error and Truth, in Hastings's En-
cyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Royce has given an ex-
cellent summary of the coherence theory that was worked
out in his earlier writings, and especially in his Gifford Lec-
tures on The World and the Individual. He holds that
truth consists of "a harmony between the partial expres-
sions of a meaning which a proposition signifies and the
whole of life, of experience, or of meaning, which, accord-
ing to this theory, ideas and propositions intend to embody
so far as they can." And he uses the analogy of the relation
of an organ in a living body to the whole of the organism
to show that he regarded this relation of a proposition to
the whole as functional and organic, rather than as static
and mechanical. He especially emphasizes the fact that
every proposition, taken by itself, is an abstraction, which
has to be completed by other propositions that express the
meanings omitted in it.
Bernard Bosanquet freely acknowledged that he built
his interpretation of the coherence theory upon that of his
friend, F. H. Bradley, whose monumental Principles of
Logic created a veritable "New Logic." Bosanquet early
developed his conception of truth in Knowledge and Real-
ity, where he subjected Bradley's Principles of Logic to
careful critical examination, and in his great two volume
treatise on Logic. Later he expanded the theory, and rein-
terpreted it in his Gifford Lectures (The Principle of In-
dividuality and Value, and The Value and Destiny of the
Individual). And shortly before he died, he restated it again
in his valuable little book entitled Implication and Linear
Inference. Bradley and Bosanquet certainly possessed minds
of the highest quality, and they spent a lifetime developing
the coherence theory of truth. Consequently their writings
will always remain primary sources for this theory.
Bosanquet's theory is also organic and functional like
that of Royce. He lays down the fundamental principle:
"Truth, in short, is not merely an antecedent framework,
but a spirit and a function. You cannot understand it un-
less you explore its operation and identify yourself with
its effort." 2 He speaks of truth involving two systems, one
of which is always indentified with or excluded from the
other. Every judgment refers only to a partial system and
this need not even be actual. It may be suppositional. Yet
every judgment must transcend supposition. Hence every
judgment refers to the whole of reality for its truth. Truth
means apprehending the partial or fragmentary system as
being continuous with the whole of reality. Consequently
every judgment we use must ultimately assert "either this
is true or nothing is." We always use our knowledge of the
whole to determine whether any given assertion is true. If
such an assertion will fit or cohere with reality we say it is
true, and if it will not we reject it as false. Thus "This or
nothing" is a test applied to every judgment to determine
whether it is true.
R. F. A. Hoernle has recently restated this theory of
Bosanquet as follows: "The act of judgment must be con-
cerned with what really is. It is something real which we
intend to characterize in judging, and we intend to charac-
2 Loco citato, p. 163.
terize it as it really is. . . . The object and its character
may be either directly presented, as e.g., in perception, or
they may be indirectly referred to by means of symbols
with the help of which we 'consider', or 'only think' of, it.
In both cases the mental attitude of judging is 'similar'. In
both cases we intend the same object, viz., the real object.
In both cases we affirm in principle that the object is really
what we perceive or think it to be. But there is the differ-
ence between perceiving the object 'itself and thinking of
it by means of symbols. The object perceived is the fulfil-
ment of the meaning of the symbols. . . . The judgments
which are possibly erroneous are judgments in which we
do, indeed, intend the object 'itself but have it present in
mind only as the meaning of a set of symbols. And this
meaning may or may not be completely fulfilled by the
object itself. If it is fulfilled, we have the coincidence or
identity which constitutes truth. In proportion as it is not
fulfilled, because the real object is other than by means
of our symbols we had thought it to be, the judgment is
false. But the character falsely ascribed to the object has
none the less its place in the universe somewhere, and is in
that sense a 'possibility'. In a false judgment such a char-
acter is misplaced, so to speak; but even after the mistake
has been discovered and corrected, the character, as a pos-
sibility, continues to belong to the constitution of the uni-
verse." 3 And this statement may be regarded as expressing
the essence of the coherence theory as it is held by contem-
porary idealists.
It follows from the coherence theory that there are
. '*. degrees of truth. Since every proposition is a fragmentary
meaning, abstracted from the whole of meaning, it is always
one-sided and possesses only that degree of truth corre-
sponding to the amount of meaning which it expresses. We
are required to complete the meaning of every proposition
by making other assertions that embody other meanings.
'Mind, Vol. XL (July 1931), pp.
In this process we get a series of propositions, each with a
degree of truth; and it follows that the totality of these .
propositions would possess more truth than any one of
them taken separately. And that is why Hegel said that
the true is the whole.
4. Different Idealistic Interpretations of Error
According to Hegel and many present day idealists the
essence of error is taking a partial view, which has a degree
of truth, to be the whole truth. Every partial view in its
unfolding reaches a stage where it is sharply enough de-
fined to exclude all other views. In many cases the mind
stops in this abstract stage of reflection and thinks that
it now has the truth. This is error. A mind caught in such
error may remain there indefinitely, but if reflection con-
tinues, difficulties will come to mind which will cast doubt
upon the truth of this partial view; and these will drive the
thinker onward to a larger view from which the error of
the previous resting place will appear obvious. Hegel de-
lighted in tracing the rise from more fragmentary to less
fragmentary views in the history of philosophy and in the
evolution of religion, and the consequent gradual elimina-
tion of error as higher conceptions were attained.
Many of the Neo-Hegelians, and especially Bradley and
Bosanquet, do not altogether agree with this Hegelian in-
terpretation of error as a phase of the dialectical movement
of thought. They agree that error is a disharmony between
the part and the whole, but they regard every human appre-
hension as sharing in this disharmony or as being fragmen-
tary. Consequently all our human judgments, all our funda-
mental concepts in science are shot through with contradic-
tions and hence are partly erroneous. Consequently what we
know by these judgments and with these concepts is only
a world of appearance. In the end human knowledge of
truth must become harmonized with other aspects of reality
in the whole which is more than truth, and more than
no
IDEALISM
beauty, and more than goodness, just because it is a unity
in which all aspects are completely harmonized.
Royce points out that this solution of the problem of
error is the weakest part of the idealism of Bradley and
Bosanquet. He lays down certain requirements of a theory
of error which this theory does not meet. Let us briefly
summarize these, since they constitute Royce's criticism of
the Bosanquetian form of idealism, and indicate the direc-
tion in which Royce's own thinking was turning at the close
of his life. (i) A theory of error must not soften the con-
trast between truth and error, but must make that contrast
just as sharp as it is between truth and falsity in the formal
consistency theory. (ii) Our theory of error must recog-
nize the unity of the cognitive and the volitional processes
of the human mind. (iii) We must retain the coherence
theory of truth. To get a satisfactory theory of error we
must treat truth as a relation between a proposition and
the whole of experience, and we must never look on it as
a relation of a proposition to some wholly external object.
(iv) We must stress the whole of experience, and not some
purely momentary or relatively transitory part of experi-
ence, in determining the truth of a proposition. (v) Error
must be definitely connected with such things as finitude,
evil, individuality, and conflict in general; and it must be
explained in the same way that these are explained. (vi)
Theoretical and practical error are to be treated as on the
same footing. (vii) To get a satisfactory solution of the
problem it is not enough to modify Hegel. We must synthe-
size Hegel, formal logical theory, and the new empirical
tendencies of modern thought.
After stating these requirements Royce briefly and suc-
cinctly states his own solution of the problem of error as
follows: "An error is the expression, through voluntary
action, of a belief. In case of an error, a being, whose ideas
have a limited scope, so interprets those ideas as to bring
himself into conflict with a larger life to which he himself
t
belongs. This life is one of experience and of action. Its
whole nature determines what the erring subject, at his
stage of experience, and with his ideas, ought to think and
to do. He errs when he so feels, believes, acts, interprets,
as to be in positive and decisive conflict with this ought.
The conflict is at once theoretical and practical." 3
Although it cannot be said that all idealists would accept
Royce's solution of the problem of error, it is certainly an
original theory which removes some of the difficulties of
the appearance theory of Bradley and Bosanquet.

Chapter V
IDEALISM'S SOLUTIONS OF THE BODY-MIND
PROBLEM
I. Resume of Early Idealistic Theories
THE body-mind problem, that is to say, the nature of
the relation between psychical or mental processes and
physiological or bodily processes, especially interested the
great philosophers of the rationalistic school, which pre-
ceded the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Descartes,
the founder of the school; his two disciples, Geulincx and
Malebranche; Spinoza; and Leibniz developed four dis-
tinctive theories, each of which continues to influence specu-
lation on this age-old problem. To pave the way for a dis-
cussion of contemporary idealistic theories, let us briefly
state each of these four classic theories.
Descartes defended the theory of interaction. According
to him the pineal gland at the base of the brain is the place
where the vital fluids of the body come into direct contact
with the soul. He chose this gland as the locus of the inter-
action because it is single, whereas all of our sense organs
and the brain itself are double; and he thought that the
soul, being single, would have to reside in some single part
of the body. His idea that the soul has a special seat in the
body is still held by some idealists, while others reject it.
Geulincx and Malebranche developed the theory of occa-
sionalism. They thought that it was impossible for two
such different substances as body and soul to act on each
other directly, so they argued that on every occasion that
it is necessary for the two to act together God intervenes
and establishes the connection. Every case of body and
112

mind acting together is really a case of a miraculous inter-
vention by God in human behavior. Spinoza abandoned the
idea of there being any definite connection between the two,
holding with the occasionalists that two entities so entirely
opposite in nature as are body and mind or, as he preferred
to call them, thought and extension, can not be conceived as
interacting. He sharply criticised Descartes's pineal gland
idea as ridiculous and absurd. Yet he was not an occasion-
alist. He originated the theory of psycho-physical parallel-
ism, which says that there are two entirely distinct events,
one in the body and one in the mind, but that neither in any
way influences the other. All that we can say is that they
are parallel in the sense that when one occurs the other
occurs also. But God does not need to intervene each time
to establish this correlation. The very nature of mind and
body is such as to make this parallelism inevitable, for both
are attributes of the one substance—God or Nature. Leib-
niz, who substituted a theory of individual and window-
less monads for the one substance and two attributes of
Spinoza, and who held that every monad, even the simplest,
possesses both perception and appetition, i.e., psychical
characteristics, developed the famous theory of preestab-
lished harmony to explain how the monads of the body and
the soul monad are related. But this theory really did a
double duty. God not only made the entire collection of
monads so that each would always act or change its states
in unison with every other, but He also created each monad
so that its internal states would change in harmony with
each other. Thus preestablished harmony meant for Leib-
niz a harmony among the separate states of each monad,
and also a harmony between the separate monads in the
entire collection of monads, as well as between the monads
of the human body and its soul monad.
In one form or another all four of these theories have
recurred again and again in philosophy ever since they were
H4
IDEALISM
originated. Hence it is especially important that the student
familiarize himself with them.1
2. Recent Advances in Our Knowledge of the Body-M1nd
Problem
Since these classic theories were formulated, enormous
advances in our knowledge of the nervous system have been
made, which have to be taken into account in any modern
solution of the body-mind problem. Let us briefly indicate
what the more significant of these advances are.
The doctrine of cerebral localization has been formu-
lated as a result of these researches, and it may be said to
embody the essence of the discoveries that have been made
by such specialists as Ferrier, Sherrington, Head, and
others. This doctrine is especially concerned with the spe-
cific parts of the brain with which the chief types of physical
activity are definitely associated. But it also implies, in its
most developed form, that the conscious or psychical proc-
esses are definitely correlated with these specific physiologi-
cal occurrences.
The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain where this
localization is centered, since it acts as a receiving area for
all nerve currents coming from the sense organs, as well as
a transmitter for all centrally aroused currents going out
to the muscles. Nerve fibres run out to the spinal chord
from the cerebral cortex and from there currents reach the
muscles. Other nerve fibres run into the cerebral cortex
from centres in the nervous system which are directly con-
nected with the sense organs. Still other but shorter fibres
1 Selections dealing with each of these theories, from the writings of the
philosophers who originated them, wilt be found among the selections from
Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza and Leibniz in my Anthology of Modern
Philosophy. The selection from Spinoza contains his criticisms of Descartes,
and at the end of the selection from Malebranche will be found an im-
portant footnote quoting a significant passage from Geulincz. The selection
from Lotze in the same volume is also important because it shows a later
form of the theory of occasionalism. Teachers would do well to assign one
of these theories to each student for a special oral or written report, based
upon an actual study of the sources.
link up the parts of the cortex. These latter fibres seem to
be connected with the conscious experience known as "re-
cent memory," since recent memory is lost when these fibres
are impaired, as in chronic alcoholism. There are still other
fibres that connect the cerebral cortex with other parts of
the brain. Among these the so-called "corpus callosum" is
especially important, since it links the two hemispheres of
the brain together. Sherrington called the whole system of
linkages the "integrative action" of the nervous system.
Now it has been discovered that all consciously initiated
movement is localized in one part of the cortex, and that
this is so precise that a spatial difference for different mus-
cles can be detected. In another part of the cortex the local
area for the cutaneous senses has been located. The audi-
tory, visual, and, with less certainty, the gustatory and
olfactory sensory brain areas are also known. While the
motor and the sensory areas are not sharply separated and
do not form definite distinguishable patterns, the probabili-
ties are that there is "depth localization" not so easily ob-
servable, as well as the "surface localization" which has
just been explained. It must not be supposed that this the-
ory is water-tight in all of its details, but it is now generally
accepted for sensory and simple voluntary processes, and it
is also generally accepted that there is less precise localiza-
tion of brain changes for the higher forms of mental
activity.
Behaviorists like to use this theory to prove that the
psychical can be identified with the physiological or neuro-
logical processes. But this is entirely unwarranted, and brain
specialists like Head and William Brown hold that there is
no exact point-for-point correspondence between the two
kinds of processes. The truth is that this doctrine of the
localization of cerebral functions cannot be used to support
any particular theory of the body-mind problem. Yet every
modern theory must be modified to take account of it. For
example, in view of these discussions interactionism must
IDEALISM
at least change the place of interaction from the pineal
gland to the cerebral cortex and the corpus callosum. But
some forms of parallelism, occasionalism and preestab-
lished harmony may be as compatible with our present
knowledge of brain processes as is interaction. Hence we
still find all of these theories vigorously advocated by pres-
ent-day idealists, who are well-informed as to the recent
discoveries in brain anatomy and brain physiology. And
behaviorism, which is simply a modern form of the mate-
rialistic theory of Thomas Hobbes, is no whit more em-
pirical than are these theories. The body-mind problem
remains unsolved scientifically. We still have to fall back
upon a metaphysical theory, or methodological assumption,
as well-informed people know, however much some psychol-
ogists may try to give the opposite impression.
3. Panpsychism
One of the most important general metaphysical theories
of the relation of body and mind is known as panpsychism.
(The word is sometimes spelled pampsychism.) This gen-
eral theory is popular with idealists because it is consistent
with the levels theory of reality, or can be readily adapted
to that theory, and because it can be interpreted so that it
is favorable either to spiritual pluralism or to spiritual
monism. Let us first state this theory in general and then
expound briefly some of its special forms.
Panpsychism is a modern doctrine closely related to the
hylozoism which was accepted by some of the ancient Greek
philosophers. Hylozoism is the theory that matter (I5\i7)
is living and has the characteristics of living organisms.
Panpsychism is the theory that every ultimately real entity
is psychical or mental and has the characteristics of a spir-
itual being. Theodore Flournoy defines it as follows: "Pan-
psychism is the doctrine which rejects the metaphysical ex-
istence of the material world as material, and which holds
that our entire universe, mineral as well as vegetable and
animal, consists at bottom of realities that are immaterial,
psychic, mental, conscious, either in an individualized and
more or less personal form, or in a more diffused and amor-
phous state ('mind-stuff', psychic atoms, etc.)."2 The mo-
nadism of Leibniz is usually regarded as the prototype of
all panpsychic theories. But James Ward quotes Spinoza's
statement, "All individual things are animated, albeit in
diverse degrees," and refers also to Spinoza's having main-
tained that "every individual thing, so far as in it lies, en-
deavors to persist in its own being." Ward calls this the
panpsychist view. He also names Nicolaus of Cusa (1401-
1464) as a panpsychist, quoting as proof his saying, "There
is nothing in the universe that does not enjoy a certain sin-
gularity, which is to be found in no other thing." But Ward
also refers to the philosophers Haeckel, Renouvier, Paul-
sen, and Wundt as holding panpsychist views. And he holds
that panpsychists agree in treating physical entities, with
their attraction and repulsion "as implying impulses initi-
ated and determined by feeling." 3 If we use the principle
of continuity, these physical entities may be regarded as the
lowest level of minds in the series extending from them,
through plants and animals, to man and God. C. A. Strong
defines panpsychism as "the view that things-in-themselves
are of a psychical nature," using the term "things-in-them-
selves," as Kant did, to mean the real things behind the
ideas or appearances of things.
In this broad sense there can be no doubt but that pan-
psychism is a view widely held by idealists. Eisler, in his
fVdrterbuch der Philosophic, distinguishes four senses of
the word, namely, realistic, idealistic, tnonadistic, and pan-
theistic panpsychism. The last three of these are all ideal-
istic types. Haeckel and Strong hold the first type, which is

expounded below under realism. Eisler's distinctions are
worth noting, but let us suggest another way of subdividing
panpsychism into different types, which is more closely
related to the traditional theories of body-mind given
above.
A. Parallelistic Panpsychism.—Accepting the view of
Spinoza and Theodore Fechner, "the hypothesis of uni-
versal parallelism," Friedrich Paulsen says, "No psychical
process without concomitant movement, no process of
movement without a concomitant psychical process. . . .
Two sides of reality are coextensive with each other; for
every fact in the one there is a corresponding fact in the
other; the psychical processes a b c correspond to the phys-
ical processes a' b' c'. A causal relation exists between the
members of the same series." But there is no causal rela-
tion between the two series. This is clear from Paulsen's
further statement: "Since, however, there are breaks in
both series, we substitute for them the members of the cor-
responding series." But he had previously written and itali-
cised this statement: "No causal relation obtains between
physical and psychical processes. States of consciousness are
neither effects nor causes of physical occurrences." So far
we have strict parallelism.
Yet elsewhere Paulsen calls this view panpsychism and
argues at length to show that there is soul-life even in
purely mechanical movements. "As we gradually descend
the scale, we find that the presentative side gradually van-
ishes, the memory becomes narrower and narrower, per-
ception scantier and scantier. At the same time, the will
gradually loses the form of anticipating ends, of conscious
craving or desire, until finally nothing is left over as the
content of soul-life except a momentary impulse, which is
aroused by contact with the environment. Inner processes
like these would have to be assumed as the concomitants
of all movements, even of those beyond the limits of organic
119
life." 4 This, then, is the parallelistic form of the theory of
panpsychism.
B. The Interaction Form of Panpsychism.—James Ward
and others follow Paulsen so far as the last statement
quoted is concerned, and think of atoms as being bare
monads with psychical life of a rudimentary sort. And they
also accept the idea of a series of monads, culminating in
soul or conscious monads. The human being is a collection
of monads of varying levels of psychical complexity, but
with one soul monad that is dominant. The body-mind
problem is concerned with the relation of this soul-monad
to the other monads constituting the human body. But there
is also the problem of how the psychical part of a bare
monad is related to its body. Ward speaks of "an imme-
diacy of interaction," by which he means "interacting
directly without any intervening medium, doing in fact,
what according to the Newtonian mechanics is impossible."
"This immediacy of interaction," he continues, "is held to
characterize the bare monad of the modern pluralist the
monad that is, so to say, its own body." Thus there is inter-
action even within the bare monad. But there is also interac-
tion between the soul monad and the other monads of the
human body. "The relation of a dominant monad (A) to
any monad of its organism (or of its brain, when its organ-
ism is so far differentiated,) is different in kind from the
relation to the same monad of the dominant monad (B) of
another organism. The one relation we may call an internal,
functional, or vital, the other an external, foreign, or phys-
ical relation. The totality of these internal relations at a
given time answers to A's objective experience at that
moment. Certain changes in this w .ole are, so far as A
is concerned, initiated by certain of the subordinate monads:
these changes answer to A's sensations, and as to these it is
receptive or passive. Certain other changes, on the other

lated by Frank Thilly (Scribners).
IDEALISM
hand, are due to A's active initiative: these entail sensa-
tions in certain subordinate monads, and their response is
what we call A's movement." 6 These passages show clearly
that Ward holds to an interaction form of panpsychism.
C. Occasionalism Form of Panpsychism.—The great
German idealist, Lotze, originated a form of panpsychism
widely held by theists and personalists today, which differs
from that of Paulsen as well as from that of Ward, and
it may be called the occasionalism form of panpsychism.
According to Lotze there is reciprocal action between mind
and body but no interaction. On the occasion of a bodily
movement the mind acts, and on the occasion of an idea
arising in the mind the body acts, but while physical and
mental action are reciprocal there is no causal relation be-
tween them. Yet Lotze's occasionalism is not identical with
the classic theory of Malebranche and Geulincx. He writes:
"Occasionalism . . . cannot be accepted as a metaphysical
theory. The notion that it can is one that has only been as-
cribed to me by a misinterpretation which I wish expressly
to guard against ... I can only regard 'Occasionalism' as
a precept of Methodology, which for the purpose of definite
inquiries excludes an insoluble question—one at any rate
which does not press for a solution—in order to concen-
trate effort upon the only attainable or only desirable end.
If it is a question of the reciprocal action between soul
and body, it is of importance to investigate the particular
spiritual processes that are in fact so associated with par-
ticular bodily ones according to general rules that the mani-
fold and complex occurrences, presented to us by our inner
experience, become reducible to simple fundamental rela-
tions and thus an approximate forecast of the future be-
comes possible." 6

4. Absolute Idealism's Solution of the Body-Mind Problem
It is not necessary to accept panpsychism in order to be
an idealist. Fashionable as this view has been among ideal-
ists of the twentieth century, it has nevertheless been sub-
jected to severe criticism by the theistic absolutist, Pringle-
Pattison, and by the non-theistic absolutist, Bernard Bosan-
quet. One brief quotation from the latter will indicate why
many absolute idealists are unwilling to accept panpsychism.
If we adopt the panpsychist theory "what becomes of the
material incidents of life—of our food, our clothes, our
country, our bodies? Is it not obvious that our relation to
these things is essential to finite being, and that if they
are in addition subjective psychical centers their subjec-
tive psychical quality is one which, so far as realized, would
destroy their function and character for us?" After quot-
ing this statement of Bosanquet Pringle-Pattison adds:
"Absolutely nothing is gained, and much confusion is in-
troduced, by resolving external nature into an aggregate of
tiny minds or, still worse, 'small pieces of mind-stuff'." 7
What, then, do idealists who reject panpsychism have to
offer in the way of a solution of the body-mind problem?
To these thinkers mind is not shut up within atoms or
monads or human bodies. Mind is coextensive with the
totality of known objects. Consequently the body is in the
mind and not vice versa, albeit the spatial meaning of en-
closure is really inapplicable to mind. It would be better to
think of mind as a cross-section of all levels of reality, since
any of the objects of any of these levels may be an object
of human knowledge. What the body does the mind does,
but the mind does much more besides. We can never iden-
TA. Seth Pringle-Pattison: The Idea of God, p. 188 (Oxford University
Press). In his recently published Gifford Lectures, entitled Mind and Mat-
ter, G. F. Stout admits that Bosanquet's criticism of Ward is valid. He
writes: "How can what is really a system of monads be immediately ex-
perienced as a material world? To this question Ward gives no answer and
no answer seems possible. This being so, his peculiar version of monadism
it untenable" (p. 174).
IDEALISM
tify any mind with its physical organism as a whole, nor
with the cortical area of the brain. We can briefly state the
relation of the mind or self of a human being to his body
and to nature, of which his body is a part, if we use the
analogy of a gateway leading to a beautiful estate in the
center of which is the dwelling-place of the owner. Man's
body is the gateway, the estate is nature, and the owner is
God or the Absolute. The body is within the human mind
and yet it is also within nature. By means of the body we
are able to communicate with nature, and when we do we
find nature already infused with another mind—God.
Hence both man's body and physical nature as a whole are
within the mind of God. When we rise to the highest level
of reality we have attained an insight into a kind of reality
which transcends the distinction between body and mind.
That distinction belongs to a lower level.
5. Some Corollaries of the Idealistic Solutions of the
Body-Mind Problem
A. Freedom of the Will.—It follows from either of the
idealistic solutions of the body-mind problem that the human
self is free in some sense. On the parallelistic theory of
panpsychism this freedom is not a part of the physical
processes. According to that type of theory the human will
is at once a member of two distinct series. On its physio-
logical side every act is a member of a causal series in the
physical world and is, therefore, completely determined.
But on its psychical side every act is a member of a value-
series of a transcendental world and as such it is free. But
from the standpoint of the interactionist freedom consists
in our ability to create new events in the physical world.
Every monad is free in a limited sense, and the higher
monads are freer than the lower. But the unified totality
of a group of monads cooperating with a soul monad, such
as man is, has a high degree of freedom in the initiation
of action.
Hocking has developed an interesting theory of freedom
on the basis of the body-mind theory of absolute idealism.
He holds that there is an interval between the suggestion
to act and the decision to act. This interval he calls "the
threshold of consent." Man's freedom is in this interval.
No consciously initiated act can avoid the threshold of
consent. Every conscious act must pass across it to become
an overt act. And in crossing this threshold it gets the
stamp of the self's approval, however much it may later
be regretted and recognized as wrong. By effort and exer-
cise every individual may lengthen or widen his threshold
of consent and increase his effective freedom. And by neg-
lecting habitually to take thought before he acts one can
shorten or narrow the threshold of consent, thereby dimin-
ishing his effective freedom. But in both cases he is free,
because he did the lengthening and the shortening, the wid-
ening and the narrowing of the threshold. We choose what
our threshold of consent is to be, as well as the specific acts
that we perform.
B. Immortality of the Soul.—It follows from panpsy-
chism that the monads are all immortal, since they are all
ultimately and metaphysically real. Consequently the soul
monad of the human body is immortal. The monads mak-
ing up the human body will be dissociated from the soul
monad at death, but it is capable of forming other asso-
ciations and its psychical existence is eternal. But for the
absolute idealist finite individuality is destined to be trans-
formed in the total experience of the Absolute. Only
strong-willed personalities, only those who achieve a highly
integrated self-hood are immortal in this view. Hocking
has well stated this doctrine of conditional immortality:
"Unless in its use of freedom a self has freely resigned
freedom and made itself 'a part of nature and not some-
thing in contrast with nature' there is no presumption, sci-
entific or otherwise, that this nature must circumscribe its
desf/ny. The life of the unsatisfied self, whose importance
IDEALISM
the contemporary psychologist has discovered, and before
him, Schopenhauer, and before Schopenhauer, Hegel and
Augustine, Plato and Paul, Buddha and Lao Tze, is the best
assurance that in the hidden arrangements of the universe
this persistent flame, half choked and fitful in the present
order, may continue its quest of breath and freedom in
another." 3 But some theists, who are not panpsychists, re-
fuse to accept this theory of conditional immortality, and
defend the view that every self or personality is immortal
by virtue of its being a part of the unified totality of all
personality, which is God.

IDEALISM'S SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF
VALUE AND EVIL
i. Analysis of the Problem of Value
THE problem of value as a separate problem of phi-
losophy has only recently come into general recogni-
tion. It is true that under the name of good the problem
has been a part of that branch of philosophy called Ethics
from the time of the Greeks. But no philosopher, prior to
the end of the nineteenth century, ever singled out value
as a special category and worked out a general theory of
its nature. It has been largely due to the modern emphasis
on economic and social theory that the nature of value has
become a real problem for philosophers of all schools. The
German philosopher, Lotze, and the German theologian,
Ritschl, are entitled to the credit for having initiated this
line of investigation, but the German thinkers, Meinong
and von Ehrenfels, were the first to devote their lives to the
attempt to formulate a general theory of value. Because of
their influence a new branch of philosophy has been created
which is sometimes called General Theory of Value, but
which is also known as Axiology, or the Science of Norms.
The idealist, Wilbur M. Urban, who studied with Meinong
and von Ehrenfels as a graduate student, wrote the first
treatise in English in this field, Valuation—Its Nature and
Us Laws, and the term axiology was first used in that book.
Urban is today one of the recognized authorities on axi-
ology, having made many important contributions to the
125
IDEALISM
various technical journals in addition to his early treatise.1
He has recently published an important Ethics text-book,
Fundamentals of Ethics (Holt), in which he has made the
concept of value central. But many other idealists have
been interested in this subject and have made significant
contributions to the development of idealistic theory of
value. Especially significant are the writings of Hastings
Rashdall, Josiah Royce, Bernard Bosanquet, DeWitt
Parker, W. E. Hocking, and J. S. Mackenzie.
With the development of axiology as a separate science
the word evil has come to mean negative value, and the
effort has been made to formulate a general theory of
value which will cover hoth positive and negative value.
In so doing two other important distinctions are empha-
sized, namely, those between instrumental and ultimate
valugj and extrinsic and intrinsic value. Let us combine
these two distinctions and speak of instrumental and in-
trinsic value. By the former is meant the value which aids
one in the realization of other values. But these other val-
ues may be other instrumental values. Let us call such
instrumental values second order instrumental values to
distinguish them from instrumental values that are not
ends. Then it is obvious that instrumental values will often
shift from first order to second order. What to one man
is a means to something else is to another an end in itself.
Do we ever escape this circle and reach a type of value
which is intrinsic, ultimate, absolute? This is one of the
most fundamental problems of value theory.
Now it is commonly held that all values are relative to
persons or to desires or to interests, and that there is no
absolute or ultimate value that is so apart from its relation
1 See Urban's article on Value in the new 14th edition of the Encyclopedia
Britannica and the references there given. On page 16 of Valuation—Us
Nature and Its Laws Urban says: "On the analogy of the term epistemology
we have constructed the term axiology." Howard O. Eaton: The Austrian
Philosophy of Value (University of Oklahoma Press) gives a good account
of the views of Meinong and von Ehrenfels.
127
to some person or desire or interest. Consequently values
are held to be wholly relative. They are additions to things
that are due to human or other living beings interested in
those things. Hence they are sometimes called tertiary
qualities to distinguish them from secondary qualities, such
as color and warmth, and from primary qualities such as
motion and extension. By calling them tertiary qualities the
fact that they are man-made additions to reality is stressed.
Apart from the relation of an object to some living being—
plant, animal or human—no value would ever exist. Ideal-
ism denies these views on the ground that persons them-
selves have intrinsic value. According to this view things
have value only in so far as they serve the ends of persons.
But persons themselves have intrinsic value (or worth), as
is indicated by Kant's famous moral law, that one should
always "so act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own
person or in any other, in every case as an end withal, never
as means only." Thus idealism reaches the theory that self-
realization, or the development of personality, is the one
intrinsic value to which all other values are instrumental.
Yet this seems to make value more subjective than ever,
since selves or persons are the results of the natural proc-
esses of organic or biological evolution, and are, there-
fore, notoriously transitory as compared with non-living
objects. No, says idealism, this interpretation of the self or
personality is abstract and one-sided. The self is a tran-
scendent reality which is not entirely subject to the forces
of biological evolution. To be a person is to be a member
of a non-biological spiritual world. In that world intrinsic
values are rooted. Hence such values are genuinely tran-
scendental and in no sense are they purely subjective. They
refer to the abode where the eternal are. What is the cen-
tral source of this eternal spiritual world? To the idealist
it is the perfection of God. God as a unifying principle of
the world of spiritual values thus becomes for the idealist
the source of all intrinsic value. Each person gets his value
from his relation to God or the Absolute Perfection, the
transcendent being who is nevertheless immanent in the
mind of every finite self. Kant's moral law means this, as
he made clear by his theory that God, freedom, and immor-
tality are the necessary postulates of that law. As Felix
Adler says: "To rate anyone as an end per se means that in
a world conceived as perfect his existence would be indis-
pensable. The world we know may not be perfect, is not
perfect, but we do conceive of an ideal world that is. And
to ascribe to anyone the quality of worth, to denominate
him an end per se, is to place him into that world, to regard
him as potentially a member of it." 2 In his Higher Pan-
theism Tennyson has beautifully expressed the central
theme of idealism's theory of value.
The sun, the moon, the stars, the seas, the hills and the plains,—
Are not these, O Soul, the Vision of Him who reigns?
Is not the Vision He, tho' He be not that which He seems?
Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams?
Earth, these solid stars, this weight of body and limb,
Are they not sign and symbol of thy division from Him?
Dark is the world to thee; thyself art the reason why,
For is He not all but thou, that hast power to feel "I am I"?
Glory about thee, without thee; and thou fulfillest thy doom,
Making Him broken gleams and a stifled splendor and gloom.
Speak to Him, thou, for He hears, and Spirit with Spirit can meet—
Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet.
God is law, say the wise; O Soul, and let us rejoice,
For if He thunder by law the thunder is yet His voice.
Law is God, say some; no God at all, says the fool,
For all we have power to see is a straight staff bent in a pool;
And the ear of man cannot hear, and the eye of man cannot see;
But if we could see and hear, this Vision—were it not He?

2. The Trinity of Transcendental Values
What becomes of the values of art, science, and morality
on this view? Are not aesthetic values realized in this
earthly, finite existence? And is the same not true of the
values of science and morality? Here, where we toil and
mingle in the intimate associations of human life, are high
cultural values which need not dwell in the empyrean. To
make the perfection of God the ultimate goal of the human
will is to substitute an attitude of other-worldliness for that
of strenuous participation in the enhancement and con-
servation of the cultural values that have been, and are
being, evolved here upon the earth. No charge against
idealism is commoner than this. John Dewey repeats it
ad nauseam. But the idealist is not scared by it. For he
holds that these cultural values are intrinsic just as much
as he insists that self-realization, culminating in the perfec-
tion of God, is the supreme intrinsic value. The idealist is
not an abstractionist. He does not strip away from the
reality of a self all cultural values, and then turn that naked
soul hungrily towards an abstract God who lacks these cul-
tural values. For the idealist's God unites within Himself
these values appreciated in art, science, and morality. God
is the unity of a trinity of transcendental values. If He is
Himself the supreme transcendental value, it is just because
apart from Him there is no meaning to truth or to good-
ness or to beauty.
For what is knowledge when the ideal order system,
or concrete universal involved in it, is ignored? It sinks to
the stimulus and response mechanism of behavioristic psy-
chology. It becomes a transitory biological phenomenon.
Knowledge that does not go beyond the cognitive process
of stimulus and response and reach an objective order sys-
tem is not knowledge. But knowledge which does attain an
objective order system is already participating in the reality
of the self-consistent whole of reality. Truth is that whole,
and God's essence includes the essence of truth.
And what is beauty when the objective reality is taken
away from the aesthetic experience? It sinks to a purely
transitory and evanescent bodily titillation. The artist em-
bodies the beautiful in his creations only in the degree that
his work is real. He must not slavishly copy nature or
aspects of nature. He must penetrate to the universal pat-
tern or harmonizing principles in his material. Art is never
the externalization of a subjective wish. "The most general
name for the specific objects of art is the beautiful; and
the beautiful may be defined as that which demands to be
possessed by reproduction. . . . Art could thus be de-
scribed as the completion of the possession of the beauti-
ful." (Hocking). And if this is what art is, then art is not
possible unless the beautiful is real. And the beautiful can-
not be real unless the spiritual world is real. And the spir-
itual world cannot be real unless it is sustained by, and
infused with, that "living Will, which shall endure, when
all that seems shall suffer shock." Hence beauty is real
because it is a part of the essence of God. According to
idealism beauty is the second member of the trinity of
transcendental values.
A recent statement by Fritz Kreisler confirms this ideal-
istic theory of beauty. He said: "Some of the loftiest as-
pirations of the human soul are reserved to those who have
the great gift of musical expression, for they thereby lift
themselves out of a material world and enter a spiritual
one. In holding communion with the great composers, who
were surely instruments in the hands of a divine power, we
are enabled to express something of the infinite. Whether
I play in public in the midst of thousands or in the privacy
of my own room, I forget everything except my music.
Whenever I am lifted out of the material plane and come in
touch with another, a holier world, it is as if some hand
other than mine were directing the bow over the strings."
And what is moral goodness when it is dissociated from
an objective spiritual realm? At the best it would sink to
the level of a shifting adjustment of conflicting interests
in a rapidly evolving social order. Unless there is some
spiritual order, some kingdom of ends, some city of God,
some Church triumphant, where the spirits of just men are
made perfect in love, how can goodness have any real ex-
istence? Royce's idea of the blessed community, which
transcends every finite social order and constitutes the es-
sence of God, is absolutely necessary if moral goodness is to
be anything but a biological and sociological phenomenon.
As the great English idealist, Hastings Rashdall, puts it:
"Only if we believe in the existence of a Mind for which
the true moral ideal is already in some sense real, a Mind
which is the source of whatever is true in our own moral
judgments, can we rationally think of the moral ideal as no
less real than the world itself. Only so can we believe in
an absolute standard of right and wrong, which is as inde-
pendent of this or that man's actual ideas and actual desires
as the facts of material nature." 3
Thus the idealist is led to the view that the supreme
intrinsic value is the perfection of God, and that the pur-
pose of human life is the development of a harmonious and
rich personality, and the bringing of that life into harmony
with God, whose will absolutely pervades all reality, while
at the same time His perfect being transcends all finite
events and processes. And included in the very essence of
God are the eternal values of truth, beauty, and goodness.
That is why the finite self which devotes itself to the real-
ization of these eternal values achieves the eternality which
these values possess.
3. The Problem of Evil
Anyone who asserts, as does the idealist, that there is a
transcendental level of reality, which is inclusive of all
3 Hastings Rashdall: Theory of Good and Evil, Vol. II, p. 212.
IDEALISM
goodness, beauty, and truth, and the essence of which is a
Spiritual Personality or Absolute Perfection, is confronted
with a most perplexing problem. That problem is that of
reconciling the existence of perfection with the facts of evil
everywhere so apparent in the experiences of men. Some
thinkers have been so impressed with the pervasiveness of
evil in human life as to answer Leibniz's classic statement:
"This is the best of all possible worlds," with the rejoinder:
"No world would be better." And such thinkers must also
be numbered among the idealists! Schopenhauer, von Hart-
mann, and their disciples defend the thesis that "the world
is my idea," but they supplement it with the statement,
"the real essence of the world on its inner side is a blind,
unconscious, irrational, willing activity." A similar form of
pessimistic idealism was developed by the great thinkers of
India. We cannot meet idealistic metaphysical pessimism
with a blind metaphysical optimism such as is represented
by Christian Science. The facts of evil are too numerous and
too poignant to be ignored and denied. Neither idealistic
metaphysical pessimism nor idealistic metaphysical opti-
mism can be said to be satisfactory solutions of the prob-
lem of evil. Both are rather extreme views to be condemned
for their one-sidedness. Goodness is real. There are many
specific values in human life. Evil is real. Negative values
are just as factual as are positive values so far as human
experience is concerned. Yet transcending the finite experi-
ences of both negative and positive values, idealism asserts
that there is a realm of perfection in which truth, goodness,
and beauty, united to form the being of God, alone are real.
And this leaves the idealist with the problem of explaining
why there is evil. Si Deus bonus est, unde malum? If God
is good, why evil?
Excluding the two extreme views of metaphysical pes-
simism and optimism, there are three solutions of this prob-
lem offered by contemporary idealists. Let us briefly con-
sider each.
A. Metaphysical Dualism.—One solution is to interpret
ultimate reality as involving a permanent conflict between *
two opposite forces—good and evil. We may soften this
conflict, as Royce does, by insisting that the Absolute is
conscious of victory even in the midst of conflict. On Royce's
theory of the Absolute as the Being with an infinite time-
span, who has an immediate knowledge of all facts, evil
has to fall within the totum simul, or eternal present, which
is the experience of the Absolute. Royce therefore accepts
evil as real and praises Schopenhauer for having given a
deeper analysis of its nature than any previous thinker.
And when Royce says that evil is real, he means that it is
metaphysically real. In the Absolute's own eternal con-
sciousness there are evil facts. But the Absolute has con-
quered them. They are in the position of vanquished ene-
mies. Hence Royce would deny that his solution of the
problem is dualistic. The experience of the Absolute is
perfectly unified and harmonious just because He is master
over all evil and recalcitrant facts.
Another way in which metaphysical dualism may be
softened is to think of God as entirely separate from and
superior to evil, while still holding that evil is metaphysi-
cally real. This is the finite God idea of Rashdall and other
idealists. God is supremely good—the very essence of per-
fection. In Him is no experience of evil or taint of sin. He
fights evil continually. But evil is real and has not yet been
overcome. There is contingency or chance in the universe
itself. (This is the doctrine which Charles S. Peirce called
tychism.) Even the ultimate outcome is not absolutely
assured. Let men of good will throw all of their strength
to the side of the good; then, under the leadership of God,
this good will finally prevail. This solution of the problem
of evil makes God a relatively limited being, but it puts
Him on a higher level of reality than man and excludes
from His nature all evil.
Yet the logical consequence of dualism is to make evil
IDEALISM
just as real as good. Both are ultimate facts and both must
be given a place in ultimate reality. When one accepts this
principle, he is unable to escape a genuine metaphysical
dualism.
B. Evil as Appearance.—Another way in which the prob-
lem of evil is solved by contemporary idealists is to regard
it as an appearance that is real to finite minds but not to the
mind of the Absolute or God. This is the solution offered
by Bradley and Bosanquet. We have here a modern form
of the old theory that evil is primarily negative. It is due
to our seeing things from a restricted point of view. If we
. could but see all facts as they are in the whole, they would
not be evil. Condemned as we are to use the body as an
instrument for our intercourse with the spiritual world of
value, we are often lost in wandering mazes. When our
minds are merged completely with the mind of God, these
illusions, which the finite mind calls evils, will disappear.
In God all moral distinctions are transmuted. Perfection is
"beyond good and evil." This follows from the principle
that the higher level is a reorganization and transformation
of the experiences of lower levels. Bosanquet holds that
good and evil are both made out of the same stuff, and
that good is simply more consistent with reality than evil.
But even good is not wholly consistent with reality. When
it becomes so it will cease to be good because it will share
in the other aspects of the whole. Bradley says that truth
ceases to be truth in the whole of reality because it there
takes on the characteristics of beauty and goodness, as
well as those of truth. This solution of the problem of evil
has had a wide appeal, and many contemporary idealists
accept it.
C. The Gradational View of Evil.—Radoslav Tsanoj?
has recently formulated what he calls a gradational view
of the nature of evil. Using the levels theory of reality, he
argues that "in a world of things and processes different in
character, difference and conflict-in-relation are just what
135
we should expect." We have to assume some sort of hier-
archy as a basic presupposition of valuation. And when we
think of the world as consisting in a "hierarchy of activi-
ties" or as "gradational," "evil is literally degradation, the
surrender of the higher to the lower in the scale of being,
the effective down-pulling incursion of the lower against
the higher." Tsanoff claims that this theory admits evil to
be real without producing pessimism and despair. And on
this view what is good on one level becomes evil on another.
"It is a fact that what at a lower level and from a lower
point of view passes for good and at that level is good dis-
closes from a higher point of view its insufficiency, and ad-
herence to it at the higher level becomes evil." Thus at each
level of reality good is what is appropriate to that level,
and evil is what is appropriate to a lower level trying to
destroy the higher level. Now God is the "Apogee of
Value." He is not the perfect being theologians have sup-
posed Him to be, for that conception of perfection implies
a static condition. We must think of God's perfection as
dynamic. Hence we must call it perfectibility rather than
perfection. "The core of reality is this eternal perfecti-
bility: the heavens declare it; evolution, cosmic, biologic, or
human-social discloses it; man's logical, aesthetic, and moral
activity reveals its sublime range. Man's idea of God is his
gesture towards the dizzy utmost of value, the infinite
reach and endless span of it." 4 This original and interest-
ing recent solution of the problem of evil seems to me to
combine Bosanquet's idea that evils are transmuted into
good in God, and Royce's idea that God's own being is a
constant and "ever-heroic redemption of the world from
the hazard of settling back."
This gradational theory of evil is perhaps as good a solu-
tion of the problem as can be offered when we look at evil
from our own human level of reality. What evil would be
*Radoslav Tsanoff: The Nature of Evil (The Macmillan Company), pp.
39'. 397 and 399.
IDEALISM
when looked at from the level of "the dizzy utmost of
value" it is not given to many mortals to know. But if we
may believe the true mystics, who claim to have experienced
the "dizzy utmost of value," no evil is there. There is what
eye has not seen and what ear has not heard and what
the mind of man has not conceived; there is the calm of
real power, eternal peace, and blessedness; there is the
God who has made man for Himself and who is forever
calling restless spirits home.
I, therefore, venture to suggest that one way out of the
problem of evil is to be found by making negative value or
evil the opposite, not of all value, but only of instrumental
value. In so far as selves are realized by their experiences
these experiences have positive instrumental value, and in
so far as the realization of selves is thwarted by their ex-
periences, these experiences have negative instrumental
value. But all selves have intrinsic value and the destiny
of all selves is communion with the infinitely perfect essence
of all reality, the unified totality of all intrinsic value—God.
He is engaged in the redemptive process of bringing spir-
itual personalities to self-consciousness and to God-con-
sciousness, and of unifying all such personalities in Him-
self. In this sense we may speak of God as the eternal per-
fectibility. But His being engaged in this process of soul-
making is not to Him an evil but a good. Hence there is and
can be no evil in God. In Him all evil is transmuted into
good, but in Him instrumental values only are transmuted
into perfection. Intrinsic values are the essence of the Being
of God.8

universals below, pp. 319 i.
TYPICAL OBJECTIONS TO IDEALISM
1. General Statement op the Reaction Against Idealism
DURING the last half of the nineteenth century ideal-
ism may be said to have attained the enviable position
of being the dominant philosophy of West European Cul-
ture. The influence of Hegel made it supreme in Germany,
and from Germany it spread to France, Italy, and England,
where great original thinkers developed new and distinc-
tive interpretations of idealistic doctrine. In the United
States, under the leadership of W. T. Harris, for many
years Commissioner of Education of the Federal Govern-
ment, idealism became the officially recognized philosophy
in teachers' colleges and other higher institutions of learn-
ing. But before the end of the century there were increas-
ing signs of revolt, and the first third of the twentieth cen-
tury will be characterized in the history of philosophy as
a period of reaction against idealism. Proponents of this
philosophy have gradually been thrown on the defensive,
and today to proclaim oneself an idealist is a far more
risky undertaking than it was thirty years ago, when for
a philosopher not to proclaim himself one was the more
ominous. In fact the critics of idealism today occupy the
strongest position in the philosophic world that they have
ever attained, and the trend of the times certainly appears
to be against idealism. However, the probabilities are that
this is the best time for young people to devote themselves
to a study of idealism, since there is every reason to believe
that the wave of reaction has about spent its force, and that
the next forward movement in philosophy will be a revival
137
IDEALISM
of idealism under a new form. The world now waits for the
genius who can create a new idealism, capable of absorbing
the truth in the anti-idealistic philosophies of our day, but
capable also of creating an original and constructive state-
ment of the essential principles of idealism.
The reaction against idealism has been fostered by rep-
resentatives of realism and pragmatism and has been in the
interest of these two types of philosophy. This fact must
be kept in mind as we consider some typical objections to
idealism. The student must remember what was said above
(see p. 50) about how to criticise a philosopher. He must
not forget that it is easier to point out defects in a theory
than it is to formulate a theory which is free from defects.
The idealist is aware of the fallibility of the human mind,
and he knows full well that the one-sidedness in idealism
will have to be corrected. But he also knows that the critics
inevitably fall into worse one-sidednesses when they become
constructive. Hence their constructive efforts are destined
to be superseded by a better idealism. This is the inevitable
outcome of the movement of philosophic reflection. Let us
not make the mistake of thinking that idealism is being
finally rejected by contemporary critics. It is only being
chastened.
Thirty years ago G. E. Moore published his now cele-
brated Refutation of Idealism. The enemies of idealism at
once hailed it as final. When Moore republished this essay
in his Philosophical Studies twenty years later, he wrote in
his Preface: "This paper now appears to me to be very
confused as well as to embody a good many down-right mis-
takes; so I am doubtful whether I ought to have included
it." This does not mean that the refuter of idealism is now
himself an idealist. But it does mean that verbal refutations
of idealism, based upon an inadequate knowledge of the
profounder literature of that philosophy, are less final than
they seem at the time they are written.
TYPICAL OBJECTIONS TO IDEALISM 139
2. Some Realist Objections to Idealism
A. Perry's Refutation of Idealism.—R. B. Perry, in
Present Philosophical Tendencies (Longmans), makes an
interesting attack on idealism which is characteristic of the
attitude towards idealism of the so-called new realism. He
holds £hat_the cardinal_principle of idealism is "the pri-
ority of the cognitive consciousness" or that "being is de-
pendent on the knowing of ft." Moore, in the essay men-
tioned above, takes the same view as Perry when he says
that the esse est per dpi (to be is to be perceived) principle
of Berkeley and Schopenhauer is the major premise on
which all idealism rests. Both Moore and Perry vigorously
attack this principle.
Perry says that it rests upon the fallacy of initial predica-
tion. By this he means that we take some accidental feature
flLi.thing.as essential to its definition. Being perceived is an
accident of an object, but Berkeley takes it to be essential
to an object/There are many other characteristics of things
which Berkgley might have hitjjppn besides this. Perry here
assumes that being perceived is an accidental characteristic
of a thing and this is the realistic assumption. But he justi-
fies this assumption by pointing out our human ego-centric
predicament. This predicament is that we can never refer
to any object without making it our idea. But this fact
does not justify us in identifying the object with our idea
of it. In fact the ego-centric predicament proves nothing at
all. Yet idealists always use it as a proof of their cardinal
principle. Perry then4'proceeds to identify all idealism with
this cardinal principle. "To anyone who refuses to permit
the issue to be confused, it must be apparent that the theory
with which Berkeley startled the world in 1710 is essentially
the same as that which flourished in the nineteenth century
in the form given it by Fichte and Hegel" (p. 134). What
the objective or absolute idealist did was to unite the car-
dinal principle of idealism with the principle of absolutism.
IDEALISM
This principle rests upon a purely speculative dogma that
there must be one general and all-sufficient principle of
explanation. Absolutism sets up a cosmic unity as the stand-
ard or limit of all thinking.
Perry then proceeds to show that there are three root
defects in absolutism as thus defined. These defects are
formalism, equivocation, and dogmatism. To escape any one
of these defects the absolutist falls back on one of the
others. By formalism Perry means resting the mind in un-
limited generalities, which it is the merit of idealism to
have discovered, but in which no mind can rest. For any
category of unlimited generality is "grossly inadequate to
everything to which it applies." Perry holds that the more
general a concept is the less sufficient it is, and the less gen-
eral it is the more sufficient. Now in order to avoid for-
malism idealism uses words borrowed from common sense
to give meaning to these concepts of widest generality.
Such words as "over-self," "super" and "absolute" mean
one thing in common speech and another in idealistic philos-
ophy. Idealists use them in their technical sense and their
readers take them in the familiar sense, and this gives
idealism a hold on the thinking of common people. But
equivocation is the price the idealist pays for this hold.
When equivocation is entirely avoided, no specific meaning
can be given to the formal concepts. In asserting the reality
of the Absolute idealists become dogmatic. Perry quotes
Joachim and Royce to show that idealists simply lay down
this doctrine dogmatically and loosely and without any
proof for it.
Perry concludes by pointing out the practical defects in
idealism. It is opposed fundamentally to the characteristic
faith of our times, which is a belief in the "gradual ameli-
oration of life through the human conquest of nature," and
clings to an outworn and antiquated faith in "the perfection
that was from the beginning and is forevermore." It is
excessively individualistic and slights society in the interest
of "that absolute self in which a man is encouraged to find
his true sphere and only genuine reality." It discredits prog-
ress as a real ideal. Moreover, there is a leveling tendency
in idealism that is pernicious. If things find their real mean-
ing only in the Absolute all the "flat differences and un-
compromising oppositions that guide the empirical and
practical intelligence" are ignored. Perry thinks that this
leveling tendency accounts for the fact that idealism has
contributed little or nothing to the solution of special prob-
lems and has no interest in special empirical discoveries.
B. Objections of British Realists to Idealism.—Many of
the objections Perry makes to idealism are to be found in
the writings of other realists, and especially in those of the
British realists. But Bertrand Russell, Moore, and other
British realists have especially attacked the coherence the-
ory of truth. According to Russell this theory rests upon
the useless and false assumption of the internality of rela-
tions. By this he means the theory of Bradley, Bosanquet,
and Joachim that "every relation is grounded in the nature
of the related terms." Thus, in order for two objects to be
related there must be a complexity in each on which the
relation in question is based. On this theory or axiom, for
so the idealists treat it, is based the theory of an absolutely
self-consistent whole of reality, and therewith the whole
coherence theory of truth, with its corollary that there are
degrees of truth and error. But no satisfactory proof of
this axiom of internal relations can be given. It is merely
an assumption idealists make. Moreover, one cannot carry
out the doctrine in practice without either becoming in-
volved in an endless regress or reaching a relation not
grounded in its terms. In the latter case we refutq the the-
ory and in the former we fail to reach the Absolute. Then,
too, the axiom of internal relations conflicts with the con-
ception of the concrete universal, the idea that every reality
is an identity in difference. As Russell puts it: "The whole
conception of identity and difference is incompatible with
IDEALISM
the axiom of internal relations, yet without this conception
monism can give no account of the world, which suddenly
collapses like an opera hat. I conclude that the axiom is
false, and that those parts of idealism which depend upon
it are therefore groundless." And Moore pays his respects
to the theory that the concrete universal is a unity of
differences. "The principle of organic unities, like that of
combined analysis and synthesis, is mainly used to defend
the practice of holding both of two contradictory proposi-
tions, wherever this may seem convenient. In this, as in
other matters, Hegel's main service to philosophy has con-
sisted in giving a name to and erecting into a principle, a
type of fallacy to which experience had shown philosophers,
along with the rest of mankind, to be addicted. No wonder
that he has followers and admirers." 1
C. D. Broad has recently formulated certain significant
criticisms of the idealistic theory of value, in his lengthy
review of A. E. Taylor's The Faith of a Moralist. Ideal-
ists like Taylor use the disjunctive argument that "either
the purely naturalistic view of human nature and destiny is
false or the profoundest ethical convictions of the best and
wisest men throughout human history are mistaken." Broad
admits the truth of the disjunction, but he argues that the
younger generation of educated people have definitely
chosen the naturalistic view, even though it does make
human effort "rather a sorry business." He imagines the
younger generation of students and tutors at Cambridge
University saying: "Our own wisest course is to try to exor-
cise, by psycho-analysis and similar means, the ghosts of
those moral ideals which still haunt us from the dead past
of our individual and racial infancy. We can then at least
set about making the best of a bad job, undiverted by the
lure of an impossible perfection, and untroubled by the
1 The exposition of Russell's criticism of the doctrine of internal relations

Essays. The quotation is from pages 168 f. The quotation from Moore is

143
stings of irrational remorse." Although Broad does not
entirely agree with this position as thus stated, he thinks it
fairly represents the modern attitude toward the idealistic
theory of transcendental values, and he is inclined to sym-
pathize with it. He holds that a man can get from himself
the incentive to reach a higher moral level. Our condemna-
tion of the secular life as most people live it may be due
to our looking at it from the outside, whereas those who
are living it probably find it quite satisfactory. The ideal-
ist's view that such a life is meaningless is based upon "a
quite exceptional standpoint which a few exceptional people
take at a few moments in their lives." The people who are
actually living the secular life cannot even understand the
criticism of the idealist. To argue that a "beatific vision" of
absolute truth, goodness, and beauty is the highest happiness
of man is to apply to all mankind what would only be true
of a few very unusual individuals. And for all we know we
may be idealizing eternity. "The denizens of eternity, if
such there be, may for all we know have troubles of their
own which do not affect the creatures of time." 2 This is
the characteristic attitude of realists towards the claim of
idealism that only a belief in the reality of transcendental
values can give adequate meaning to human life.
C. Objections of Critical Realists to Idealism.—George
Santayana, the most distinguished of the so-called critical
realists, has often subjected idealism to examination. We
have space for only two of his interesting criticisms of the
idealism of Josiah Royce.
Santayana holds that Royce's transcendental conception
of the Absolute is incompatible with his social realism.
According to the former, individual minds and social minds
alike are ideas only. Only the Absolute Mind is real. But
according to the latter, individual minds and social or group
minds are empirically real and just as much so as anything
else. For Royce the Absolute is "an actual synthetic univer-
2 Mind, Vol. XL, pp. 371 f. The quotations above are on page 367 f.
IDEALISM
sal mind, the God of Aristotle and of Christian theology."
Yet Royce was a social realist. He admitted that "there are
many collateral human minds, in temporal existential rela-
tion to one another, any of which may influence any other,
but never supplant it nor materially include it." 3 But these
two views are radically opposed. In trying to harmonize
them Royce attempted the impossible.
Royce's famous analogy between a self-representative
system and the Absolute is attacked by Santayana. Royce
used this analogy to show that an individual can be a part
of the Absolute and yet retain his individuality. His famous
example of a self-representative system is a map of Eng-
land spread out on English soil, which would be a part of
England and yet would reproduce every detail of England,
including itself. If we then made a map of the map and
kept repeating this process, the original map would keep
reappearing in each successive map as an element in it.
Santayana holds that this does not solve the problem of the
relation of the individual to the Absolute. For either all of
the maps are merely parts of the surface of England which,
in being, for example, continually washed by the sea, is
radically different from the maps, or there is no England
at all but only a series of maps. In the latter case, too, the
Absolute would be the entire series, and therefore radically
different in character from any member of the series. Thus
in either case the Absolute is entirely different from the
individuals. Moreover, there is a difficulty in the fact that
all of the maps are exactly alike, whereas individual human
beings are notoriously different. Hence the analogy com-
pletely fails to clarify the relation of individuals to the
Absolute.
s For these criticisms of Royce see the chapter on Royce in Santayana's
Character and Opinion in the United States (Scribners). The quotations
are from p. 132. For other criticisms of idealism see Santayana's Egotism in
German Philosophy, Scepticism and Animal Belief, and The Genteel Tradi-
tion at Bay. The latter is quoted below, p. 227.

3. Some Pragmatist Objections to Idealism
All of the pragmatists have attacked idealism, but it will
suffice here to summarize the objections of William James
and John Dewey.
James called idealism noetic monism, because it insists
that the entire universe is the realm of objects of a single
knower, and is unified by the cognitive activity of this single
knower, the Absolute. In Some Problems of Philosophy
James lists four radical defects in this view: (i) It fails to
account for finite minds. We know one thing without know-
ing another thing, whereas the Absolute Mind knows every-
thing at once. Hence we are different from the Absolute,
and we "know differently from its knowing." (ii) For other
philosophies the one problem of evil is how to get rid of
it, how to throw it overboard like ballast from an airship.
This is a purely practical problem. But for idealism, which
asserts the reality of Perfection, there is an insoluble the-
oretical problem of how there can be imperfection. In his
Collected Essays and Reviews there is a short discussion
by James entitled "The Mad Absolute," which shows how
he thought the Absolute would have to be conceived in view
of the presence in His world of so many glaring imperfec-
tions. (iii) To us change is most real and a highly
essential ingredient in what we experience. But the experi-
ence of the Absolute is said to be timeless and beyond our
powers of comprehension. It follows that Absolute Ideal-
ism has to make our world of experience an illusion, like the
Maya of Hindu Idealism. (iv) Absolutism is fatalistic
and excludes possibility from reality. It asserts that all that
is, is necessary and that all else is impossible. This sharply
conflicts with our human consciousness of freedom that
"the next turn of events can at any given moment genuinely
be ambiguous, i.e. possibly this, but also possibly that."
Thus all real novelty and uniqueness is excluded by the
idealistic view.
IDEALISM
Dewey has been a persistent critic of idealism and all of
his books are filled with objections to its various detailed
theories. He especially likes to show that idealism is merely
an intellectual defense of emotional attitudes that come
down from the past. In his opinion all the types of idealism
are conservative and more or less out of touch with modern
life and modern developments in science. He thinks that the
supposed transcendental values of idealism are superim-
posed upon experienced goods. But the latter have been so
greatly expanded and multiplied by modern science that "the
sense of transcendent values has become enfeebled; instead
of permeating all things in life it is more and more restricted
to special times and acts. . . . Whatever men say and
profess, their tendency in the presence of actual evils is to
resort to natural and empirical means to remedy them." 4
This is Dewey's way of saying that idealism is gradually
"petering out" as a philosophy.
In his little book entitled Reconstruction in Philosophy
(Holt) Dewey summarizes his attack on idealism under
three headings: (i) It is conservative and propagandizes
for old beliefs and prejudices and social practices. This
involves an insincerity which is often unconscious and is,
therefore, the more invidious. Idealism aims primarily at a
rational justification of things that have been previously
accepted, instead of looking toward the future and finding
new solutions for live problems. (ii) Idealism is purely
formal. It magnifies the signs of rigorous thought whenever
it finds itself unable to prove its contentions empirically.
Unwilling to accept mere social convention as the basis for
its beliefs, and not being able to find real inductive reasons
for them, idealism hunts specious dialectical and formal
arguments, and covers up its defects with a mass of ver-
biage. This is what causes so many present-day students to
turn away with contempt from the serious study of philoso-
phy. At its worst idealism is merely a lot of elaborate ter-
* John Dewey: The Quest for Certainty, p. 257 (Minton Balch).
minology and hair-splitting logic that is purely formal. It
is unwilling to admit, with Bishop Butler and William
James, that probability is the guide of life. It seeks now,
as it has always sought, an unattainable certainty. (iii)
Idealism has made a fixed distinction between two worlds,
the transcendent or noumenal world, to use Kant's term,
and the world of everyday life and science, which idealism
likes to call the world of mere appearance or description.
And then it claims to have a special method of knowing
the noumenal world, which differs from the ways of know- *
ing of scientists and common men. This claim is false and it
is coming more and more to be recognized as so, and the
distinction between the world of phenomena and the nou-
menal world is rapidly being abandoned.
In reaching these three defects in idealism, or, as he calls
it, classic philosophy, Dewey uses the genetic method. He
shows how each defect has arisen because "the genetic
method of approach is a more effective way of undermining
this type of philosophic theorizing than any attempt at
logical refutation could be." And here he states the
characteristic attitude of many contemporary pragmatists
towards idealism, which is to ignore its serious arguments,
and to discredit it by branding it as an intellectual defense
of the status quo in all fields of human knowledge and
experience.
Part Three
REALISM
WHAT REALISM IS
i. The Word Realism
LIKE the word idealism the word realism has many
meanings, especially when combined with other words.
It is not easy to disentangle all of these meanings. Perhaps
the best approach is to consider three related senses of the
word as it is employed in literature and art, where it is
also used as the opposite of the term idealism. Realism in
art may mean deliberately neglecting the elements of har-
mony and beauty in a subject, and describing ugly things or
elaborating sordid details. Or it may mean an excessive
emphasis on individual and particular items, and devotion
to meticulous details to the neglect of types and universal
patterns. But the most exact meaning of realism in art and
literature is the representation and portrayal of any and all
facts just as they are, without any effort to idealize and
interpret them so as to make the good outweigh the evil
and the beautiful overbalance the ugly. Thus Thomas
Hardy's novels are excellent examples of realism in this
sense. The philosophical usage of the word realism is
nearest to this third sense.
However, in philosophy the word is used to refer to a
number of significant tendencies. The common element in
all of them is the insistence upon realities that are entirely
independent of the cognitive process by which they happen
to be known to human beings. As George Santayana puts
it: "Realism in regard to knowledge has various degrees.
The minimum of realism is the presumption that there is
such a thing as knowledge; in other words, that perception
151
REALISM
and thought refer to some object not the mere experience
of perceiving and thinking. The maximum of realism would
be the assurance that everything ever perceived or thought
of existed apart from apprehension and exactly in the form
in which it is believed to exist: in other words, that percep-
tion and conception are always direct and literal revela-
tions, and that there is no such thing as error." 1 Thus there
is a wide range between the minimum and maximum mean-
ings of realism. The simplest form of realism is the naive
realism of the man in the street, who probably thinks that
all of the objects experienced in his waking life are real,
just as they are experienced, and whether they are being
experienced or not. In his book entitled A Theory of Direct
Realism J. E. Turner calls this "truncated realism" to dis-
tinguish it from the direct realism which he defends. In the
first chapter of this book we dealt with this type of realism
under the name of Everyman's Philosophy or the philoso-
phy of the unphilosophical. The philosophical realist would
not hold such a crude type of realism, but would substitute
for sense objects various more refined "scientific objects,"
such as points and volumes, protons and electrons and what
not.
2. Historic Forms of Realism
Realism is one of the most ancient of philosophies, but
it has not always been called realism. Under the names of
materialism and naturalism the realistic tendencies in
human thought have always been more or less widespread
and influential. Albert Lange's three volume History of
Materialism, which has recently been reissued, should be
read by all who wish to trace the story of the gradual emer-
gence in the history of thought of the philosophy of real-
ism. In the form of naturalism and materialism realism is
as old as Heraclitus and the Greek atomists, especially
Democritus. Among the Romans Lucretius revived this type

Durant Drake, and published by The Macmillan Company.

of philosophy in his De Rerum Natura, making use of the
atomism of Democritus. Thomas Hobbes, the first great
modern philosopher, is a typical representative of the nat-
uralism and materialism which developed on the basis of
the science of Galileo. Yet none of these types of philoso-
phy were called realism, partly because they stood in rather
sharp opposition to Platonism, which was then regarded as
realism.
A. Classic Realism.—This is the name of the theory of
universal ideas which arose in the Middle Ages, when a
dispute arose among the schoolmen as to whether the kind
or species names were just mere words or actual realities.
Based on Plato's theory that ideas in the sense of universal
types or patterns (archetypes) are more real than their
actual embodiments in particular existents, classic realism
held that universals or kinds are the only realities. Hence
classic realism was a theory of the nature of universals and
was primarily concerned with their ontological status. It is
an interesting fact that many contemporary realists share
the view of the scholastic realists that universals are real.
(See Part V, Chap. II, 5.) Consequently the basic conten-
tion of classic realism has been incorporated in contem-
porary realism.
B. Representative Realism.—This is the name usually
given to the dualistic philosophy of John Locke and some-
times to that of Descartes. On this theory there are certain
objective qualities called the primary qualities of matter—
extension, solidity, motion, rest and number, and certain
powers—the power to produce changes in other bodies and
the power to produce ideas in the human mind of secondary
qualities, such as colors, tastes, odors, etc.,—which are ob-
jectively real independently of any percipient organism. We
have ideas in our minds which copy or represent these real
qualities and powers that are in objects, and hence the name
representative realism. Because of the criticisms of Bishop
REALISM
Berkeley and David Hume representative realism fell into
disrepute, but it is now being revived, and some forms of
contemporary realism are closely allied with it.
C. Natural Realism.—This type of realism arose as a
reaction against Hume's sceptical conclusion as to the real-
ity of any object independent of the sense impressions.
Thomas Reid developed this theory most consequentially.
According to Reid we have to accept certain common-sense
principles which are suggested to us by natural suggestion.
Only a fool or a madman, said Reid, would attempt to
shake off his original belief in the reality of existences dis-
tinct from his sense impressions. But Reid was not a dualist
like Locke. Under the name of the Scottish philosophy this
natural realism has exercised a great influence, extending
down to the present day. James McCosh, an able teacher at
Princeton, promulgated it in this country. And T. Case,
whose Physical Realism was published in 1888, admits that
he holds the realism of the Scottish School.
D. Herbartian Realism.—This is a type of realism based
upon the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. J. F. Herbart, who
was for a time the successor of Kant on the faculty of the
University of Konigsberg, analyzed Kant's thing-in-itself
and his transcendental ego into ultimate "reals," and he
made these "reals" the basis of his metaphysics. Through
various combinations of reals the ordinary sense-objects of
everyday life arise. This Herbartian realism has also influ-
enced contemporary realism, and Herbart deserves great
credit for having developed the realism that was latent in
Kant's philosophy.
E. Transfigured Realism.—This is the name which Her-
bert Spencer gave to his theory that there is an unknow-
able reality behind all of the manifestations of mind and
matter. Spencer thought that every event in the world of
the knowable was related to some mode of the unknowable
reality, but that there was no resemblance between them.
155
There is also a close relation between the theory of Spencer
and certain forms of contemporary realism.2
3. Classifications of the Contemporary Types of Realism
A. Sellars's Classification.—In classifying contemporary
types of realism in the English-speaking world R. W.
Sellars adopts the principle of dividing them along national
lines on the ground that "those who live together and know
each other personally influence each other most strongly."
Accordingly he deals with English Realism as represented
by Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, Samuel Alexander,
Percy Nunn, L. A. Reid, C. D. Broad, Lloyd Morgan, and
A. N. Whitehead. He should also have mentioned J. E.
Turner, L. J. Russell, Dawes Hicks, C. E. M. Joad, John
Laird, and others. The difficulty with throwing all of these
thinkers together in one group is that there are very sig-
nificant differences among them. Sellars then takes up
American Realism. This he divides into two types—the
New Realism and Critical Realism. A similar division could
be applied to the English realists. However, these names
happen to come from the titles of two books written by
groups of American thinkers who conferred together and
developed a set of doctrines on which they agreed, whereas
no such cooperative effort has ever been undertaken in Eng-
land. Nevertheless the English realists do really fall into
distinct groups. Then, too, there are a number of impor-
tant American realists who did not cooperate in the writ-
ing of either book, and Sellars fails to take them into
account. Chief among them are E. B. McGilvary, M. R.
Cohen, G. S. Fullerton, J. Loewenberg, C. J. Ducasse, and
2 Selections setting forth Hobbes's materialism, representative realism
(Descartes and Locke), the natural realism of Reid, Herbartian realism, and
the transfigured realism of Spencer will be found in my Anthology of
Modern Philosophy. See also the selection from George Santayana on "The
Unknowable of Herbert Spencer" in my Anthology of Recent Philosophy,
for proof that Spencer's agnosticism is an important element in contempo-
rary realism.
REALISM
J. E. Boodin, each of whom has developed a distinctive
realistic standpoint. Sellars's principle of division is there-
fore faulty in that it fails to take account of all of the real-
ists of the English-speaking world. And to make the classifi-
cation complete it would also be necessary to have a class of
German and of French Realism, for there are similar move-
ments in Germany and France. The Germans, Husserl and
Meinong, are especially important because of their influ-
ence on British and American thinkers.
The six authors of the volume entitled The New Realism
are Edwin B. Holt, Walter T. Marvin, William P. Mon-
tague, Ralph Barton Perry, Walter B. Pitkin and E. G.
Spaulding. This volume appeared in 1912, but the realistic
movement represented in it really began with the publica-
tion of Josiah Royce's The World and the Individual, in
Volume I of which the realistic hypothesis that objects are
entirely independent of the cognitive relation was carefully
examined and rejected. In the Monist of 1901 and 1902
Perry discussed at some length Royce's critique of
realism, and it was largely due to this attempt to answer
Royce that the New Realism got under way as a separate
type of philosophy. Perry there defined realism as follows:
"The realist believes reality to be a datum, a somewhat
that is given independently of whatever ideas may be
formed about it. According to the realist, the real has a
locus, a habitat, whether or no within some individual ex-
perience. Here the real primarily is, and is, regardless of
whatever secondary meanings, symbols, relations, or ideas
of any kind may be referred to it." Thus this type of real-
ism arose as a polemic against Roycean Absolute Idealism
and announced itself as a reform movement. Each of the
six representatives drew up a brief separate "platform"
which was approved by his colleagues, and these six plat-
forms are published in the Appendix of The New Realism.
They give a good idea of the basic tenets of the American
New Realism.
157
Essays in Critical Realism was written by seven men—
Durant Drake, Arthur O. Lovejoy, James B. Pratt, Arthur
K. Rogers, George Santayana, R. W. Sellars and C. A.
Strong. It was first published in 1921. The various essays
were worked out separately by each man, but all agreed on
the basic positions taken by each author. In the Preface it
is made clear that the chief aim of these writers was to
differentiate their brand of realism from that of the New
Realists. They wrote: "Our realism is not a physically
monistic realism, or a merely logical realism, and escapes
the many difficulties which have prevented the general
acceptance of the 'new' realism. It is also free, we believe,
from the errors and ambiguities of the older realism of
Locke and his successors." Thus critical realism actually
arose as a reaction against the one-sidedly monistic and
mathematical and logical tendencies in the new realism,
and it is in the direction of the idealism which the new
realists attacked. This does not mean that critical realism
is an idealistic philosophy, but it does mean that it incor-
porates many more idealistic features than does the new
realism. But Montague is also apparently leaning away
from the new realism in an idealistic direction if one is to
judge by his recent writings.
B. Zafarul Hasan's Classification of Contemporary
Realism.—Zafarul Hasan, who studied in England and
Germany, and who has written the best history of realism,8
has employed a much more logical principle of classification
than that used by Sellars. He distinguishes first the "old era
of realism" from the "new era." Under the former he dis-
cusses the origin of realism in Descartes, and briefly ex-
pounds the realism of Locke and Reid. Under the new era
he deals with all contemporary types of realism. The com-
mon characteristic of all of these is the maintenance of the

ment in Its Chief Representatives. With a foreword by J. A. Smith (Cam-
bridge University Press). Cf. D. Luther Evans: New Realism and Old
Reality.
REALISM
dual thesis "that the external world exists and is directly
apprehended in perception." But there are three "series."
The First Series is represented by the German phenom-
enologists who developed the theory that the world is "pure
experience"—Schuppe, Mach, and Avenarius. These think-
ers stressed the fact that real objects are apprehended in
perception, but they failed to make the objects entirely inde-
pendent of experience. The Second Series is represented by
Meinong in Germany, Stout in England, and the critical
realists in America. It especially stresses the independence
of objects, but it fails to bring out the directness of percep-
tion. The Third Series is a synthesis of the other two. It is
"not simply realistic but realism" because it especially
stresses both the independence of objects and the directness
of perception. Here Hasan deals with Alexander, Russell,
and the American new realists. He treats G. E. Moore's
realism as the highest form of realism of this third series.
He also includes H. W. B. Joseph, Prichard, and Cook
Wilson in his third series, holding that they form a sepa-
rate phase of that series. Whatever one may think of
Hasan's opinion of Moore and his naming of Moore as the
greatest contemporary realist, his classification undoubt-
edly has the merit of being based upon a genuinely logical
principle of division, and it certainly helps to clarify the
various present-day tendencies in philosophy which go by
the name of realism.
4. William James and Other Founders of Realism
Perry, Sellars, and Russell all treat William James as the
real founder of the new realism. In his Preface to James's
Essays in Radical Empiricism, of which he was the editor,
Perry says that James's theory of radical empiricism, as
finally developed by him, goes beyond pragmatism and
really constitutes the germ of realistic metaphysics. And
he quotes three statements from the Preface of The Mean-
ing of Truth (Longmans) to prove his point, commenting
159
WHAT REALISM IS
on each. This passage from James is undoubtedly an im-
portant source of American new realism, since most of the
six authors of The New Realism were students of James,
and shared his theory of radical empiricism and his hos-
tility to Royce's absolute idealism. James wrote: "Radical
empiricism consists (i) first of a postulate, (ii) next of a
statement of fact, (iii) and finally of a generalized conclu-
sion, (i) The postulate is that the only things that shall
be debatable among philosophers shall be things definable
in terms drawn from experience. (Things of an unexperi-
enceable nature may exist ad libitum, but they form no part
of the material for philosophic debate.) (ii) The state-
ment of fact is that the relations between things, conjunc-
tive as well as disjunctive, are just as much matters of direct
particular experience, neither more so nor less so, than the
things themselves, (iii) The generalized conclusion is that
therefore the parts of experience hold together from next
to next by relations that are themselves parts of experience.
The directly apprehended universe needs, in short, no ex-
traneous trans-empirical connective support, but possesses
in its own right a concatenated or continuous structure."
According to Perry this passage is the real germ of the new
realism. It proclaims that reality is an "experience-con-
tinuum." McGilvary has taken up this idea of reality as an
experience-continuum and has made it the basis of his real-
ism, and in so doing he explicitly bases his account of the
continuum of duration, which is nature, on James's theory
of the stream of consciousness.
In his Treatise on Human Nature David Hume sug-
gested the possibility of assuming an independent existence
for the experienced elements which make up what James
called the stream of consciousness. But Hume rejected this
hypothesis because it was incompatible with the basic
assumptions of his philosophy. Now James took up this
suggestion of Hume and defended it as true. These ele-
ments experienced by us are neither mental nor physical.
REALISM
They are "neutral stuff" out of which both mental and
physical objects are constructed. And these neutral entities
are the only ultimates we know in experience. This theory
of neutral entities, which are neither mental nor physical,
but which form the basis for both mind and matter, has
been generally accepted by the new realists. Holt developed
it in his article in the New Realism and Russell has also
adopted it. And its source is William James's doctrine of
radical empiricism. Hence James should be recognized as
the founder of realism, or, at least, of the type known as
new realism or neutral monism.
Yet Zafarul Hasan denies that James was the founder
of realism. He writes: "By his doctrine of radical empiri-
cism, which he started to expound in print in September,
1904, James helped to give an impetus and a direction to
neo-realism in America. The denial of the mind as subject,
the reduction of all reality to a homogeneous objective ma-
terial called 'pure experience' or 'neutral stuff,' the concep-
tion of knowledge as a relation between objects—doctrines
for which he is profoundly indebted to Mach, and further
the fight against intellectualism and the doctrine of internal
relations, are elements of decisive importance for the neo-
realist. But neither James nor Mach gives him realism.
Perry indeed holds Mach's Analysis of Sensation to be a
'classic of realism', and asserts that James passed from
phenomenalism to realism with his doctrine of radical em-
piricism (cf. Present Philosophical Tendencies, p. 365).
Both conclusions seem to be mistaken." 4 Hasan holds that
it was natural for Perry to assume that James was a realist
when he made "experience (= objects of experience) the
stuff of all reality," because he wanted to make James's
view consistent. But the truth is that James was not con-
sistent. His real view is that of Mach and Avenarius, and
he does not assert that the elements of experience are inde-
pendent of all minds. James raises this question, but when
4 Loco citato, pp. 303 f.
he does he goes over to panpsychism. For a perceptual ele-
ment not experienced by any mind would have to be "an
experience for itself." Consequently James was not actually
a realist.
Hasan should have concluded that James was not a con-
sistent realist as Hasan defines realism, rather than that he
was not a realist. The founder of a new philosophy never
is consistent if conformity with the latest development of
his view be the test of consistency. He lays down princi-
ples which others take up and develop. In this sense Wil-
liam James will go down in the history of philosophy as
one of the chief founders of the new realism, which origi-
nated among some of his most capable students at Har-
vard during the closing years of his life. But he will also
go down in the history of philosophy as the founder of
pragmatism. Thus he occupies the unique position of having
been the founder of two of the most important types of
contemporary philosophy.
However, it is not true to say that James was the sole
founder of realism. James acknowledged his own indebted-
ness to the Englishman, Shadworth Hodgson, whom Hasan
only mentions in a footnote as having influenced G. E.
Moore. A. E. Heath has pointed out that the two forerun-
ners of English new realism were Hodgson and L. T.
Hobhouse, both of whom undoubtedly influenced G. E.
Moore and Samuel Alexander, as well as other English
realists. He writes: "Shadworth H. Hodgson, the fore-
runner with L. T. Hobhouse of English 'new realism',
sought in his 'subjective analysis of what is actually experi-
enced' to reach the reality of objects in 'face to face per-
ception'. A thing is what it is known as—a reality inde-
pendent of the existence of a perceiving consciousness." 5
Perry mentions the similarity between the notion that
"realities are what they are known as," which James "re-
5 Article on Realism in Hastings's Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics,
Vol. X, pp. 5»4 f.
peatedly attributes to Shadworth Hodgson" and James's
postulate which was quoted above. So far as English and
American new realism are concerned, the chief founders are
William James, Shadworth Hodgson, and L. T. Hobhouse.
But Sellars also rightly mentions the fact that F. J. E.
Woodbridge, who has been a close student of Hobbes, and
is today one of the recognized leaders among the realists,
was also influential in the early development of American
new realism.6
Bergson, the distinguished French vitalist, has greatly
influenced the realists, especially in his theory of duration
as the living reality of nature, but he is not himself a real-
ist. He is much nearer idealism, as is shown by his theory
that matter is a by-product of the elan vital or vital im-
petus, and his contention that the brain is the creation of the
mind.

THE METHODS OF REALISM
i. Scientific Method in Philosophy
REALISTS generally agree in stressing the need of mak-
ing philosophy scientific. It is a common charge of
realism against idealism that it has been unscientific in
its method, and too closely related to the non-scientific as-
pects of culture, such as literature, art, and religion. A
major part of the realistic program of reform consists in
emphasizing the close relation of philosophy to the sciences
and in stressing the ideal of a philosophic method that is
genuinely scientific. Only in this way can the realistic goal
of a truly scientific philosophy be realized.
As Morris R. Cohen rightly points out,1 there are three
ways in which those who would develop a truly scientific
philosophy, and utilize the achievements of scientific in-
vestigations in their philosophizing, may proceed. (i) They
may endeavor to synthesize the facts and laws of the va-
rious sciences, and thereby construct a new philosophical
interpretation of reality that will be truly scientific. This is
undoubtedly the aim of many present-day realists. Looked
at from this point of view philosophy is the most general
of the sciences and builds upon the results achieved in all of
the special sciences. There are two serious difficulties in this
procedure. In the first place, only specialists are capable
of judging what the real results in a science are, and the
philosopher can not possibly be a specialist in every branch
of science. He must rely upon the more popular accounts
1 See Morris R. Cohen, Reason and Nature, pp. 147ft. (Harcourt, Brace
4 Co.).

REALISM
of scientific discoveries. Secondly, a synthesis of various
sciences would not necessarily be scientific. In fact it could
not be because of the many gaps in our knowledge just at
the borderlines of the separate sciences. Any so-called syn-
thesis either has to ignore these gaps entirely or fill them
with pseudo-scientific hypotheses that are not verifiable by
any of the methods of science. Hence such syntheses are
bound to be more imaginative than they are scientific, (ii)
Another way in which we may try to make philosophy scien-
tific is to take as its special province the examination of the
"first principles" or presuppositions on which the various
sciences rest. This was the method of Kant, and many real-
ists are willing to accept this much of the Kantian pro-
cedure. But there are two major difficulties in constructing
a scientific philosophy by this method. A theory of the basic
assumptions of science does not have any way of eliminating
the possible errors in those assumptions. And the belief
that we have an a priori knowledge of nature, prior to any
investigation made in the special sciences, has been proved
false by modern discoveries in mathematics and physics.
Consequently, however useful and important a science of
the first principles of science would be, it does not seem pos-
sible to develop such a science in the present state of our
knowledge.2 (iii) The third way is to extend the methods
of science to philosophy. Philosophy is recognized as hav-
ing its own unique subject-matter, but it is held to be pos-
sible to study that subject-matter scientifically instead of
dealing with it speculatively. The goal of philosophy is to
construct a special method of dealing with its subject-mat-
ter which will be an extension of the basic principles of
scientific method as employed in the special sciences. This
2 The most interesting recent attempt to develop such a science is F. S. C.
Northrop's Science and First Principles (The Macmillan Co.). Northrop
points out that there are three different theories of nature, each based upon
a different set of premises, the mathematical, the functional, and the phys-
ical, and he defends the physical against the functional and mathematical.
Although his book cannot be said to constitute a science of first principles,
it contains an excellent philosophy of science.
is the most hopeful way of making philosophy scientific.
But what is the basic principle of scientific method? On this
question there is a difference of opinion among realists.
Some look to the mathematical and physical sciences for
this principle, and others look to the biological and social
sciences. ,
C. D. Broad takes the position that there are two dis-
tinct fields of philosophical inquiry, and Cohen is inclined to
agree with him. One of these fields is that of criticising and
defining exactly and accurately the fundamental concepts or
categories and beliefs of science. This gives philosophy a
subject-matter that is different from any special science, yet
that subject-matter can be investigated by the same methods
of analysis, generalization, and abstraction that are effec-
tive in the special sciences. This type of philosophy Broad
calls Critical Philosophy. It takes over from the sciences the
methods that are fruitful there. It classifies the various
types of propositions used in all of the sciences, and it de-
fines fundamental scientific concepts. But Broad recognizes
that philosophy must also go beyond science and get a total
view of the world by bringing in the facts and principles of
aesthetic, political, and religious experience. Here the
synoptic method of seeing things in their total relations is
essential. To this extent both Broad and Cohen, as well as
other realists, are willing to use the dialectical method of
Hegel. But Speculative Philosophy never reaches very
definite results and must always wait for the advance of
critical philosophy. Hence it must be strictly subordinated
to critical philosophy. The speculative urge must not run
away with itself, but must be continually held in check. We
dare not construct arbitrary systems which are at variance
with the empirical facts.
Generally speaking, however, the realists agree with Ber-
trand Russell that philosophy must make a "substitution of
piece-meal, detailed and verifiable results for large untested
REALISM
generalities recommended only by a certain appeal to im-
agination" if it is to become really scientific.8
2. Realism and Modern Logic
Russell and other realists think that the best way to make
philosophy scientific is to utilize in philosophy the results
of the so-called modern logic. These results are based upon
three important discoveries: (i) Frege, the German mathe-
matician, investigated the concept of number and proved
that the numbers which are used in arithmetic are neither
physical nor mental existents, but belong to a purely logical
domain. This established the existence or reality of a purely
mathematical and logical world of relations, (ii) Peano,
the Italian mathematician, was the first to point out the ex-
tremely important difference between the form of a singular
proposition such as "Socrates is mortal" and the form of a
general proposition such as "All men are mortal." This
cleared up a confusion about "the relation of things to their
qualities, of concrete existences to abstract concepts, and of
the world of sense to the world of Platonic ideas" (Rus-
sell). The world of Platonic ideas, to which Russell here re-
fers, would include Frege's domain of numbers, (iii) Georg
Cantor, a German mathematician, solved the problems of
infinity and continuity. He showed that we can reason about
a collection that is infinite even though it is impossible to
know all of its terms by enumerating them one by one. An in-
finite collection is given all at once when we know how it is
defined, and an unending series may form a whole even
though there are new terms which are beyond the whole of
it. In showing that such infinite collections are conceivable,
and not self-contradictory, Cantor undermined the dialecti-
cal arguments of the idealists which were intended to show
that such concepts as space and time are self-contradictory.
8 Bertrand Russell: Scientific Method in Philosophy, p. 4. For the facts in
the next paragraph see the article entitled "Realism and Modern Logic" in
Hastings's Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethici.
For example Cantor's theory solves the paradoxes of Zeno
which were intended to show that motion is inconceivable.
As Russell puts it: "The reasons for regarding space and
time as unreal have become inoperative, and one of the great
sources of metaphysical constructions is dried up."4
Now Russell, and other realists, think that the proper
procedure for philosophy is to utilize this method of ab-
stract reasoning that has been perfected in mathematics
to deal with philosophical problems. This will lead to a re-
jection of the dogma of the internality of relations on which
idealism is based, and the acceptance of modern logic's
theory of the externality of relations.8 By developing a
symbolism for the various mathematical and logical rela-
tions Russell and Whitehead have been able to combine and
extend the discoveries of Frege, Peano, and Cantor. Un-
doubtedly one of the most important permanent contribu-
tions of realism to philosophy has been this creation of
modern symbolic logic.6 Whether the assumption is justi-
fiable that the method of reasoning by which symbolic
logic has been developed is capable of extension to the
more concrete subject-matter of philosophy is another ques-
tion. The ideal of applying this method to all of the prob-
lems of philosophy has certainly not yet been carried out.
Realists have not yet succeeded in rewriting the philosophy
of science, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics with the sym-
bols of mathematical logic. They still find it necessary to
write on these subjects with the less accurate and less pre-
cise language everybody uses.
3. The Method of Analysis
The new realists have especially stressed the method of
analysis as the fundamental method of philosophy. This

and Forms of Thought (Holt); and L. S. Stebbing: A Modern Introduction
to Logic (Crowell).
REALISM
method is emphasized throughout the New Realism, but it
has been set forth in greater detail by E. G. Spaulding in
The New Rationalism.
Spaulding recognizes that analysis and synthesis must be
used together. And he makes the important distinction be-
tween analysis and synthesis as employed in experimental
work and as employed in the mathematical sciences. By the
former he means actually taking any existing whole apart
and putting it together again, as a mechanician does in re-
pairing a badly damaged machine. In philosophy we deal
with wholes which cannot be so analyzed and synthesized.
Hence what we must do is to analyze in situ. We observe
and study a whole until we see its parts and we leave these
in situ just as they are, but we discover by this analysis
how the parts are related to form the whole they actually
do form. When we use this latter form of analysis and
synthesis we do not reach specific individual entities, but we
reach types that we never see but which reason shows us to
be implied. We can see this best if we use the example of
space. We can analyze the space of physical objects into
three dimensions, each of which is a straight line without
dimensions, and which, therefore, cannot be represented
by pencil or crayon lines because such lines have dimensions.
And we can analyze any given line into smaller lines, as we
do when we analyze a foot into twelve inches. If, now, we
repeat this analysis until we reach the very limit of our in-
struments of measurement, we then find that we can still
carry it on indefinitely, but we also find that there is a limit
which the increasingly smaller lines approach and never
reach. This limit is a point. It cannot be seen or touched. We
reach it by implication. Now knowledge of a point is knowl-
edge by type and not knowledge of a specific entity. We dis-
cover these types by analysis, and we discover what the rela-
tion is between points and their number in the same way.
Hence this method of analysis is extremely fruitful in ex-
tending our knowledge beyond what we can observe even
with high-powered telescopes and microscopes. It is the
essence of mathematical reasoning as employed in the spe-
cial branches of mathematics, but also as employed in math-
ematical physics and chemistry.
In using this method of analysis in situ we must be on
our guard against certain persistent fallacies. One of these
is basing the analysis on incorrect logical principles. This is
what underlies the famous antinomies of Kant. Or the logic
actually embodied in the entities reached by analysis may not
have been discovered. Then, too, the analysis may have
stopped too soon and may, therefore, be incomplete. And
finally a correct analysis may be misinterpreted. These four
defects constitute faulty analysis, against which one who
uses the method of analysis must be on his guard. The ad-
vantages of the new logic over the old are enumerated by
Spaulding, but they amount to one, namely, that the new
logic is a tool for correct analysis whereas the old yields
only faulty analyses. Thus Spaulding would interpret the
method of the new logic as being primarily a correct way
of analyzing.
4. The Method of Extensive Abstraction
There is a difficulty in the definition of a point as a limit
we reach by implication and never reach by actual percep-
tion. This difficulty is due to the fact that our definition
is a mathematical abstraction which does not fit the gross
and crude objects of ordinary sense perception. Thus anal-
ysis, as defined by Spaulding, is a method of reasoning
that takes us away from the world of actual experience and
substitutes for that world the refined entities of mathe-
matics. It does not provide a way of getting back again
to the facts of experience. And even though these entities
of mathematics be regarded as real independently of the
knower, as Frege thought, they are nevertheless not the
realities that are known in perceptual experience. This
means that they do not provide us with a satisfactory real-
istic theory of the world of nature. It is for this reason
that the definition of a point as a limit to the series of
abstractions reached by analysis has been abandoned by
A. N. Whitehead, C. D. Broad, and other new realists.
These thinkers recognize that the method of analysis in
situ is incomplete and unsatisfactory, and they have worked
out a much more precise method which solves the problem
of the connection between mathematical concepts and sense
data.
The earliest suggestion of this method is contained in an
interesting passage in Bertrand Russell's Scientific Method
in Philosophy which was published in 1914. He there refers
to a certain "principle of abstraction" which has proved
extremely useful in mathematics and which can be extended
to philosophy. He writes: "This principle, which might
equally well be called 'the principle which dispenses with
abstraction,' and is one which clears away incredible ac-
cumulations of metaphysical lumber, was directly suggested
by mathematical logic, and could hardly have been proved
or practically used without its help. . . . When a group
of objects have that kind of similarity which we are in-
clined to attribute to possession of a common quality, the
principle in question [he means the principle of abstrac-
tion] shows that membership of the group will serve all
the purposes of the supposed common quality, and that
therefore, unless some common quality is actually known,
the group or class of similar objects may be used to replace
the common quality, which need not be assume'd to exist"
(p. 42). Here is the germ of the method of extensive ab-
straction.
In Scientific Thought (Harcourt, Brace & Co.), C. D.
Broad explains how this method originated. Mathematicians
discovered that it does not matter at all what the internal
nature of a term is, providing it can be used to explain
things satisfactorily. "This important fact, that what really
matters to science is not the inner nature of objects but their
mutual relations, and that any set of terms with the right
mutual relations will answer all scientific purposes as well
as any other set with the same sort of relations, was first
recognized in pure mathematics. Whitehead's great merit
is to have applied it to physics" (p. 39). It was the appli-
cation to physics which produced the method of extensive
abstraction. In his An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of
Natural Knowledge (Cambridge University Press), Part
III; The Concept of Nature (Cambridge University
Press), Chapter IV; and Process and Reality (The Mac-
millan Co.), Part IV, Whitehead has worked out this
method in great detail, but Chapter II of Broad's book
gives a much simpler exposition of it for beginners.
The fundamental principle on which the method is based
Whitehead calls "the principle of convergence to simplicity
with diminution of extent." By narrowing down what we
are studying to the smallest possible extent we get it in a
simple enough form so that we can handle it. But since all
the events in nature are continuous and possess depth, it is
extremely difficulty to exclude and narrow down without
an exact method for so doing. The method of extensive
abstraction aims to supply that need. Its great value is that
it enables the investigator to define the basic concepts essen-
tial to the understanding and interpretation of nature so
that they correspond with nature as experienced in sense
perception.
Suppose we want to define a point. To sense experience a
point is a volume and therefore it has parts. But to Euclid,
and in Euclidian Geometry, a point is "that of which there
is no part." Hence Euclid's definition of a point conflicts
with points as actually experienced volumes. Suppose we
want to define a line. To sense experience a line has width.
But to Euclid, and in Euclidian Geometry, a line is
"breadthless length." Hence Euclid's definition of a line
conflicts with lines as actually experienced. The usual way
out of this conflict is that taken by Spaulding above, which
REALISM
is to define a point as the limit of a series of smaller and
smaller "breadthless lines." But, as we have already indi-
cated, this way out lands us in an abstract conception which
we cannot be sure exists. To use Broad's language: "We
should like to say that points are the limits of smaller and
smaller volumes, one inside the other, like Chinese boxes.
But we cannot feel any confidence that such series have
limits and therefore that points, so defined, exist. Now
there is no doubt that such series themselves exist; ordinary
perception makes us acquainted with their earlier and big-
ger terms, and the assumption that space is continuous guar-
antees the later ones. We see, on reflection, that it is of the
very nature of any area or volume to have parts that are
themselves areas or volumes. We therefore, boldly define
points, not as the limits of such series, but as such series
themselves" (p. 44).
This then, is the method of extensive abstraction applied
to defining a point. But it can also be used to define such
other fundamental concepts as straight lines and areas. We
take series which are observable and identify such series
with the concept, instead of identifying the supposedly
last member of the series with the concept. In An Enquiry
Concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge White-
head calls such series "routes of approximation." He there
writes: "The various elements of time and space are formed
by the repeated applications of the method of extensive
abstraction. It is a method which in its sphere achieves the
same object as does the differential calculus in the region
of numerical calculation, namely it converts a process of
approximation into an instrument of exact thought. The
method is merely the systematization of the instinctive pro-
cedure of habitual experience. The approximate procedure
of ordinary life is to seek simplicity of relations among
events by the consideration of events sufficiently restricted
in extension both as to space and as to time; the events are
then 'small enough.' The procedure of the method of ex-
tensive abstraction is to formulate the law by which the ap-
proximation is achieved and can be indefinitely continued.
The complete series is then defined and we have a 'route of
approximation.' These routes of approximation according
to the variation of the details of their formation are the
points of instantaneous space (here called'event-particles'),
linear segments (straight or curved) between event-par-
ticles (here called 'routes'), the moments of time (each of
which is all instantaneous nature), and the volumes inci-
dent in moments. Such elements are the exactly determined
concepts on which the whole fabric of science rests"
(p. 76). This is a very fundamental passage because it
gives Whitehead's own summary statement of the method
of extensive abstraction. Elsewhere in Principles of Natural
Knowledge and in Process and Reality Whitehead calls
these 'routes of approximation' abstractive sets. In Process
and Reality he writes: "By reference to the particular case
of three-dimensioned space, we see that abstractive sets can
have different types of convergence. For in this case, an
abstractive set can converge either to a point, or to a line,
or to an area. But it is to be noted that we have not defined
either points, or lines, or areas; and that we propose to
define them in terms of abstractive sets" (p. 454).
The method of extensive abstraction is still in the mak-
ing, but it is undoubtedly a significant contribution of real-
ism to philosophy.
REALISM'S SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF
KNOWLEDGE AND EXISTENCE
i. The Theory of Emergent Evolution
CORRESPONDING to the levels theory of reality of
idealism the realists have developed an interesting
theory known as emergent evolution. The word emergent
was first given a technical philosophical sense by G. H.
Lewes in the following passage: "There are many ways in
which the properties of a mass differ from those of its
molecules; the chief of these is that some properties are
emergents, not resultants." C. Lloyd Morgan took the term
over from Lewes, and Samuel Alexander borrowed it from
Morgan. Morgan says that Lewes used the term in the same
sense in which John Stuart Mill used the phrase "hetero-
pathic laws," and that both men intended to "distinguish
those properties (a) which are additive and subtractive
only, and predictable, from those (b) which are new and
unpredictable." In other words the term emergent evolu-
tion is the name of the theory that nature is a product of
evolution in which new and unpredictable qualities appear,
on the basis of what already has appeared, and that these
new qualities form distinctively new levels of reality. Alex-
ander says: "Mind has certain specific characters to which
there is or even can be no neural counterpart. It is not
enough to say there is no mechanical counterpart for the
neural structure is not mechanical but physiological and has
life. Mind is, according to our interpretation of the facts,
an 'emergent' from life, and life an 'emergent' from a lower
physico-chemical level of existence." And in a footnote he
i74
explains that he took the word 'emergent' from Morgan
and that "it serves to mark the novelty which mind pos-
sesses, while mind still remains equivalent to a certain
neural constellation. Consequently, it contrasts with the
notion that mind is a mere 'resultant' of something
lower." 1
In his address at the Sixth International Congress of
Philosophy Arthur O. Lovejoy defines the word emergence
more precisely by distinguishing five different senses in
which one level may be said to contain novel features as
compared with another that preceded it. One of these would
be simply changes in the laws of existents but not in the
existents themselves. If entities are related in a new way
at one level from what they were at another and lower
level we could speak of an emergence of relations or laws.
A second way would be for new qualities to arise and attach
themselves to what previously existed. This is emergence of
qualities. A third way would be for new entities to arise
which lack some of the characteristics of those of the lower
level and which have some new ones. Let us call this the
emergence of existents. Fourthly, a new type of event or
process different from those at the lower level could begin
to occur. This we may call emergence of events. And finally
a larger quantity, either of events or qualities or entities or
relations, than existed at the lower level might characterize
the higher level. This may be called emergence of quan-
tities. We may call all of the last four existential emer-
gence as contrasted with the first, which is an emergence
of laws. Lovejoy discusses both general types and concludes
that the evidence is in favor of emergence of new relations
or laws, and that there has also been an emergence of new
1 See G. H. Lewes: Problems of Life and Good, Vol. II, Chap. IV, para-
graph 49; C. Lloyd Morgan: Emergent Evolution, p. 3; and Samuel Alex-
ander: Space-Time and Deity (Macmillan), Vol. II, p. 14. But compare
F. J. E. Woodbridge: "The Problem of Metaphysics" in Philosophical Re-
view, Vol. XII, p. 383, where he says: "Something new must add itself,
must emerge, as it were, out of non-existence into being."
events and new entities. But he argues that there is no rea-
son to believe, and that there are serious reasons for doubt-
ing, whether this has been at all general or at all frequent
throughout the physical universe. So far as we can judge
it is confined to the biological and social evolution we know
here on the earth. Hence we have to reject the belief in
"cosmic meliorism,"—the notion that there is a process of
emergence of ever higher levels of reality throughout all
nature. And yet we may well accept an earthly meliorism
—the notion that before the millions of years that still re-
main to mankind have elapsed new and richer forms of be-
ing will emerge.*
Alexander and Morgan do not make the distinction be-
tween cosmic and earthly meliorism. For them the process
of emergence is characteristic of nature throughout its in-
finite extent. Hence they make emergence a metaphysical
principle. Alexander holds that there is a "fluency of time."
Nature began as a Space-Time, a four dimensional mani-
fold or matrix in which time was the moving principle. In
this lowest level there was no matter and there were no
qualities other than the four dimensions of Space-Time, in-
cluding the fluency of Time. But Time was higher than
Space even in this lowest level. The second level was
reached when the primary qualities of matter emerged
out of the original Space-Time matrix, due to its inherent
urge or nisus to something higher. Then came the second-
ary qualities of matter. With the emergence of primary and
secondary qualities came new kinds of relations, distinct
from the purely spatio-temporal relations among events
which characterized the lower level. What Alexander seems
to have in mind here is the relations among the constituents
of any element, say the hydrogen atom. But, as the table of
elements suggests, the whole process of the emergence of
elements was gradual, and the higher and more complex
2 See the selection from A. O. Lovejoy in my Anthology of Recent Philos-
ophy. For the meaning of the term meliorism see below, p. 294.
elements had to wait for the lower. When the physical or
'c material universe, with the elements, especially carbon,
.c hydrogen and oxygen, had emerged, the basis was laid for
the emergence of life. This brought with it new vital rela-
tions that had not before been in existence. When life at-
tained the complexity exhibited in animals, mind emerged.
Both life and mind were new and each had its own dis-
tinctive relations and qualities. And there were numerous
stages in the emergence of each. Moreover, each level of
reality has separate beings peculiar to it.
On the basis of this concept of emergence Alexander
conceives of deity as the next highest level to be emerged
out of any given level. Thus for beings on the level of life
mind is deity, but for beings possessing minds there is a
nisus or urge toward a still higher quality, and to such
beings that higher and dimly felt quality is deity. Thus the
quality next above any given level is deity to the beings on
that level. For human beings deity has not yet emerged
but there is a nisus towards its emergence. That is all that
beings at our level can say about deity. But when deity
emerges, there will be beings who possess that quality. Alex-
ander refers to such beings, half playfully, as angels. But
they will feel an urge to a still higher quality above them,
and that quality above the angels will be deity to the angels.
Here is an exceedingly interesting and novel conception of
nature as an evolutionary process in which ever higher qual-
ities, relations, and beings continually emerge, on the basis
of the qualities, relations, and beings that have already
emerged. And it is interesting to note that R. B. Perry
accepts Alexander's theory of deity. He writes: "Samuel
Alexander is, I think, correct in insisting that deity shall be
conceived as a type of emergence which is founded on per-
sonal life, but which cannot be adequately defined in terms
of such categories as mind, spirit or personality." 3

Morgan has represented this theory in a diagram which
he calls the synoptic pyramid. D stands for deity at the apex

essence of nature or reality. As Morgan says: "Such a dia-
gram—for which Mr. Alexander is in no way responsible—
is, so to speak, a synoptic expression, or composite graph, of
a vast multitude of individual pyramids—atom-pyramids
near the base, molecules a little higher up, yet higher, things
(e.g. crystals), higher still, plants (in which mind is not yet
emergent), then animals (with consciousness), and near the
top, our human selves" (Loco citato p. n).
Realists have been very much concerned over the onto-
logical or existential status of what they call sensa. This is
a technical term obtained by shortening the expression
sense data. Sensa are the actual objects we perceive. For
example, when an organism or percipient being perceives an
ordinary sense-object, such as a star, he never sees the actual
star with all of its physical qualities, but he has before him
as objects of his awareness visual sensa only. If the sense-
object be nearer to him so that his other senses can operate,
for example, if it be a tulip he is holding in his hands, in
addition to the visual sensa there will be olfactory, tactual,

and cutaneous sensa. Since these sensa are the immediate
objects that are before the mind in sense perception, the
question arises as to what their status is in reality. Are they
mental or are they physical in their internal nature? Are
they mind-dependent or body-dependent? Or are they, per-
haps, purely neutral and ultimate entities, more basic than
either mental or physical entities? We learned above that
James regarded them as the pure stuff of reality and held
that the whole universe is reducible to such neutral stuff.
Russell and many of the new realists hold the same view.
But other realists have different theories of the nature of
the sensa.
C. D. Broad holds that the sensa are real and not mere
appearances of some physical thing. They are particular but
short-lived existents. They have such properties as shape,
size, hardness, color, loudness, coldness, warmth, in fact
all sense qualities. The shape of a sensum is not necessarily
the same as the shape of an object. Think, for example, of
the elliptical shape of a penny when seen from a certain
angle and the roundness of the real penny. The qualities of
sensa are the basis of the qualities we attribute to objects,
and the qualities of objects are correlated with those of
sensa. The separate groups of sensa of all the observers
who sense a certain object form the appearances of that
object to those observers. Sensa may have other qualities
that are noticed by the observer, but they certainly always
have whatever qualities the observer discriminates in them.
But even though sensa are the appearances of objects they
are themselves real. Broad denies that sensa are physical
and that they are psychical. They appear to have some
characteristics of psychical and some of physical entities.
But they are body-dependent rather than mind-dependent,
being conditioned by the percipient organism. Here Broad
is in agreement with the new realists. But do the sensa be-
long to the physical world? Broad takes the position that
the sensa could be all the world there is, so far as we can
really know, and that they neither prove the existence of
a physical world nor that of a mental world. We can only
say that the belief that they are dependent on a physical
world, more permanent and complex than they are, is (i) a
primitive belief that we all have, (ii) it arises inevitably
with sensa, (iii) it cannot be refuted logically or got rid
of in any other way, and (iv) we cannot adequately sys-
tematize and properly coordinate the facts without it.
Hence Broad would reject James's theory that the sensa
are the only ultimate reality, and he would make them
dependent upon physical nature, which he believes to exist
but admits that he cannot prove.
Broad holds that the sensa are produced in some way.
But the all-important question is, How are they produced?
Is the production a selection which the organism makes out
of nature, and do our sensa, therefore, constitute a cross-
section of the physical world? Yes, say the new realists.
Consciousness is the field of objects selected by a percipient
organism. Or is the production generative? Do our bodies
cause or create the sensa? Broad holds this generative
theory, although he admits that there is no direct proof for
it. Its chief advantage is that it offers fewer difficulties than
the selective theories. Russell and some other realists at-
tempt to combine the selective and generative theories of
sensa, using one to avoid the difficulties of the other. But
even though we accept the generative theory and treat sensa
as the creations of percipient organisms, we still have on
our hands the very difficult problem of showing how there
can be one whole of nature, which combines the sensa of
psychology and the physical objects of physics. This prob-
lem Broad holds to be one of the unsolved problems of phi-
losophy, and its solution waits for a creative genius of the
first rank.
3. The Theory of Essences
We learned above that the realists believe in the objec-
tive reality of a world of mathematical and logical relations
called universals. Russell claims that the realists have
discovered relations as universals and that that is what dis-
tinguishes realism of the present-day from the classic form
of realism. For classic realism was interested wholly in
universal qualities. We saw that Broad, Whitehead, and
Russell attempt to bridge the gap between the world of
mathematical and logical relations and the world of sense
experience by means of the method of extensive abstraction.
But we have just learned that Broad thinks that no way has
yet been found to organize the world of sensa and the world
of physical objects into a single whole of nature. Thus the
realists are left, by their own confession, with a certain un-
resolved dualism in their philosophy of nature.
The critical realists, who are not afraid of dualism as
between mind and nature, do try to avoid it in their theory
of nature. Under the leadership of George Santayana they
have developed a unique theory of essences to explain what
the world of reality is. This concept of essence is central in
their philosophy, but it is exceedingly difficult to say just
what they mean by it. It seems to be something quite unique
and particular and yet something universal. It seems to be
absolutely and unquestionably real and yet to lack exist-
ence. Santayana defines it as follows: "By 'essence' I mean
a universal of any degree of complexity and definition,
which may be given immediately whether to sense or to
thought. Only universals have logical or aesthetic individu-
ality, or can be given directly, clearly, and all at once. . . .
[An essence is] an ideal individual, which being individuated
only by its intrinsic quality, not by any external or dynamic
relations (since none are given), is also a universal. This ob-
ject of pure sense or pure thought, with no belief super-
added, an object inwardly complete and individual, but
without external relations or physical status, is what I call
an essence." 4
4 George Santayana in Essays in Critical Realism (Macmillan), p. 168
(note). See also his Realm of Essence (Scribners).
REALISM
In this interesting definition of an essence the following
items should be especially noted. Essences are not simple
but of varying degrees of complexity. They are not known
just by perception or just by conception but by both, and
immediately, without any process of inference. They are
universals because they are wholly given all at once, whereas
particulars come to us part by part or in succession. The
individuality of essences may be either logical or aesthetic,
but it is never moral. Elsewhere Santayana stresses the fact
that essences are neither good nor bad, but that they are
morally neutral. They are individuals constituted by inter-
nal relations and not by any external relations. This fact
that essences are constituted individuals by their internal
relations is what makes them universals. But these internal
relations do not do anything which constitutes the essence.
Dynamic relations are excluded from essences as well as
external relations. Hence their complexity is more a matter
of their intrinsic quality than it is of their internal relations.
Essences do not exist: they have no physical status. Any
belief about them or about their relations to nature or to
mind or to one another is superadded to them. They are
independently real apart from minds that know them, or
physical nature, or one another. In other words, each es-
sence is an original, unique, eternal, and independent reality.
Each is inwardly complete. No essence needs another.
There is an infinite number of such essences, some of which
are known and some of which are not known, but knowing
them makes no difference to them. They are the true objects
of the philosopher's contemplation, because they provide
the mind with a type of object which cannot possibly be
doubted. Santayana says that the mind of the philosopher
that has been enlightened by doubt and freed of noisy dog-
matism "finds in the wilderness of essence a very sweet and
marvelous solitude," a field "of endless variety and peace,
as if through the gorges of death it had passed into a para-
dise where all things are crystallized into the image of
themselves, and have lost their urgency and their venom."
C. A. Strong argues that the sensa can best be under-
stood when they are treated as essences, rather than as
either physical or psychical entities. Consequently sensa are
not private, as many have held. If we take data to be
essences "the same datum exactly might be given to another
person, or to the same person at a different time and
place; in such wise that the datum as such would not be in
time and space." 8 Thus the critical realist bridges the gap
between sensa and universals by simply identifying the
former with the latter. But he is left with a dualism be-
tween a mind and the essences which it knows. This, how-
ever, is an epistemological rather than an ontological dual-
ism, since the only real world is the world of essences.
4. Some Realistic Theories of Knowledge
The critical realists hold to epistemological dualism, the
theory that ideas represent the objects which they know but
are not identical with those objects. And how can an idea
in the mind represent a physical object in nature? Accord-
ing to the critical realist it can do so because the essence
of the idea and the essence of the physical object are identi-
cal. Thus on this view there are existing minds and existing
physical objects. But there is also a non-existing but real
world of logical essences. A particular idea of a particular
mind can know a particular quality of a particular tulip be-
cause the essence of the idea is identical with the essence of
the quality of the tulip. Thus for the critical realist the
world of essences forms a bridge across which the mind
passes to confer with nature. Hence, epistemological dual-
ist though he admittedly is, the critical realist is an onto-
logical monist, because he makes the world of essences
5 See the selection from C. A. Strong in my Anthology of Recent Philos-
ophy where he gives proof for this striking theory. The quotation from
Santayana above is from the selection from him in the same volume, p. 332.
REALISM
unite the worlds of mind and nature. Or rather he is a
metaphysical pluralist because the essences are as unnum-
bered and as innumerable as the sands of the sea, and they
do not really form a world, but, as Santayana says, a wil-
derness.
The new realists, on the other hand, are epistemological
monists. They hold that an idea is identical with its ideatum
or object. Consciousness is merely a perspective or field,
and the objects remain the same whether they are within
or without this field. Even illusions, dreams, images of all
kinds are sensa and objective and independent of mind.
They are subsistent entities. When they become known
they form a part of some mental perspective, and are, in
that perspective, ideas. But when they are not externally
related to a knower in this way, they are equally real. The
cognitive relation does not affect their status in any way,
since it is; purely an external relation and does not do any-
thing to its terms. Recently this view has been called pan-
objectivism, because it makes absolutely everything objec-
tive, even dreams and illusions.
In expounding the idealistic theory of knowledge we
found that Royce developed a theory of interpretation as a
higher form of knowing than perceiving or conceiving.
Similarly Montague, among the realists, has attempted to
develop a theory of knowledge that is a synthesis of epi-
stemological dualism and pan-objectivism, with an ingredi-
ent of what he calls subjectivism or idealism.
The truth in epistemological dualism can best be ex-
pressed, Montague thinks, in its basic assertion that "the
system of objects experienced by a self and the system of
objects existing externally to that self and causing its ex-
periences can vary independently of each other." This is in
accord with common sense, and no one can question it. The
truth in the idealistic or subjectivist theory is that "all en-
tities are (selectively) relative to a self and possible objects
of its experiences." Even so-called imperceptible objects,
like atoms and their protons and electrons, do not possess
any other but perceptible qualities, such as size, shape, and
weight. And remote objects, such as those that exist in far
distant regions of space or those that existed before life
arose on the earth, are possible objects of experience and
are described by us in perceptual terms. The truth in the
pan-objectivist theory or epistemological monism is that
"all experienced objects have an independent meaning or
essence that gives them a status of possible physical exist-
ence." Experience proves that many of our perceived ob-
jects (sensa) are identical with the object that we later dis-
cover to be real. And even illusions and imaginary objects
have an independent meaning that is logically distinct from
its place in any definite context. Hence the basic assumption
of each of the three theories is true. We need a synthetic
theory which will combine these three assertions and which
will omit the extraneous and incompatible features in each
theory. This is possible because these three assertions in
no way conflict. On the contrary, they are mutually com-
patible and reciprocally supplementary. "Each expresses a
different aspect of the knowledge situation—or rather, each
expresses the whole situation from a particular angle, mak-
ing clear and explicit certain values which the other two
leave vague and implicit." 8 Montague thinks that his syn-
thetic theory is a final and complete solution of the prob-
lem of knowledge.

REALISM'S SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF
TRUTH AND ERROR
HE formal consistency theory of truth, which was ex.
X pounded above (pp. 101 ff.), is held by many realists.
Some, like G. E. Moore, treat truth as a quality of purely
formal propositions. It will be obvious from what follows
that realists are by no means in agreement on a solution of
the problem of truth, although the correspondence theory,
in some of its forms, is the most widely accepted theory of
truth among realists. But before dealing with these forms
of the correspondence theory, let us consider a realistic form
of the coherence theory.
i. A Realistic Form of the Coherence Theory of Truth
In dealing with the idealistic theory of truth two basic
questions were distinguished: What beliefs are true? and
What is trueness? And it was pointed out that the second
of these questions is the more fundamental for philosophy,
and that idealism answers that question in terms of the
theory of the coherence of our beliefs with reality. Samuel
Alexander has developed an interesting form of the co-
herence theory that is more in accord with his peculiar type
of realistic metaphysics, which was expounded above under
the name of emergent evolution. To the two questions just
stated Alexander adds a third: "What are the relations
subsisting between the propositions of any science in virtue
of which they assume their systematic form?" This, he
holds, is the question of logic, but he admits that the strictly
philosophical question of the nature of trueness is the
really fundamental one.

In answering this question Alexander distinguishes the
non-mental facts of the physical sciences and the mental
facts accompanying these. The former he calls beliefs and
propositions. They are contemplated by the mind. The lat-
ter are acts of the mind. "They are not the objects of be-
lief but they are the judging itself," or "the contents of
the act of judging." These mental propositions are enjoyed.
The science which arranges them in a system is psychology.
This distinction between contemplation and enjoyment,
with correspondingly different kinds of propositions, is im-
portant, because it makes it necessary for Alexander to hold
that there are two entirely different kinds of truth. One is
the truth of beliefs about what is contemplated and the
other is the truth of beliefs about what is enjoyed. Let us
consider the first kind of truth more in detail and then
briefly explain the second kind.
No matter what the subject-matter contemplated is,
Alexander holds that the internal structure of that subject-
matter determines whether a given belief is true. When
that entire structure supports a belief, that belief is true.
Hence true propositions may be said to be real, but "their
truth is different from their reality." To explain this dif-
ference between the truth and the reality of true proposi-
tions Alexander brings in the social intercourse of minds.
It is under "the guidance of reality" but through "the clash
of minds" that one set of beliefs about a given reality gets
accepted and another set gets rejected. Thus the coherence
is a coherence among beliefs as determined by a collection
or group of observing minds. Those beliefs which the col-
lection of observers find coherent with each other and with
reality are true beliefs. Hence truth is not identical with
reality, yet it is "reality as possessed by minds." In Alex-
ander's own words: "Beliefs get sorted out, and one set are
real in themselves, the others belong to a different reality.
But this distinction only comes into existence through the
conflict and cooperation of many minds, and the reality, or
real propositions, are true only in their relation to the minds
which have reality for their possession and reject the judg-
ments of the erroneous minds. Truth and error are in this
sense creations of mind at the bidding of reality. Moreover,
they imply relation not to the individual mind as individual
but to the individual mind in its attitude to the social mind,
that is to the individual as a standard mind. The mind
which has truth has it so far as various minds collectively
contribute their part to the whole system of true beliefs;
the mind which has error is so far an outcast from the in-
tellectual community." 1
The truth of mental propositions is later in developing
than the truth of propositions that are contemplated. Be-
fore we can detect truth or error in our judgments we must
be somewhat familiar with the truth and error of beliefs
about external matters, and we must be fairly well social-
ized. Truth of mind arises out of our desire to communi-
cate with our fellows. To the objection that enjoyments are
purely private and that they are, therefore, incapable of
truth or falsity, like contemplated propositions which are
admittedly shared, Alexander replies that our coopera-
tions with one another widen and deepen our enjoyments,
and enable us to make clear to others what those enjoy-
ments are. We learn to compare one mental process with
another, and we also learn to compare ourselves with others
as they tell us of their experiences. Hence truth of purely
mental propositions is possible, and psychology is a real
science.
Logic is concerned only with the purely formal aspect of
truth. It investigates formal consistency of propositions
with one another, entirely apart from their respective con-
tents. It is the science of propositional forms, and deals
with the ways in which different propositional forms may
be combined so as to secure real consistency. Hence logic
is the science of those aspects of truth that are common to
1 Samuel Alexander: Space-Time and Deity (Macmillan), Vol. II, p. 258.
contemplated and to mental propositions. It is a general
science, covering both the principles of the objective
sciences, like physics and biology, and those of the purely
mental science of psychology. Here, then, we have a pe-
culiar realistic form of the coherence theory of truth, which
embodies the essence of the formal consistency theory and
stresses the coherence between propositions which consti-
tute reality as known.
2. Realistic Forms of the Correspondence Theory of Truth
A. The Correspondence Theories of Russell.—Bertrand
Russell has more than once attempted to formulate a con-
sistent realistic interpretation of the correspondence theory
of truth. In his earlier writings this took the form of a dis-
tinction between proposition or fact-complexes and beliefs.
Believing is a subjective relating activity which ties things
together for a believer. But fact-complexes or propositions
consist of terms that are related by some one or more ob-
jective and external relations. A belief is true when it re-
lates the facts of the total fact-complex together in the same
order in which the objective relation relates them together.
In his Problems of Philosophy Russell uses the illustration
of Othello's belief that Desdemona loves Cassio to clarify
this notion of correspondence. In order for this belief to be
true the relation of loving would have to unite the two
terms Desdemona and Cassio in the same way that the
relation of believing or judging related them in Othello's
mind. Since the fact-complex does not have love relating the
two terms in that order Othello's belief is false. It does not
correspond with the fact-complex.
In his Philosophical Essays Russell distinguishes judging
from perceiving. Judging is the relation of a mind to a
fact-complex or objective proposition, but perceiving is the
relation of a mind to a single object or "objective," objec-
tives being purely conceptual objects such as universals.
When we perceive an object, we have knowledge by ac-
quaintance. Similarly, when we perceive an objective, say the
relation of identity, we have knowledge by acquaintance. In
these cases of perceptual knowledge there can be no false-
hood. All knowledge by acquaintance is true. But we have
to distinguish between a pure perception, like seeing light,
and a judgment of perception, like "this light that I see is
sunlight." Judgments of perception may be erroneous, but
they are less likely to be so than more complicated judg-
ments such as are involved in describing something we have
experienced to some one else. This kind of knowledge Rus-
sell calls knowledge by description, and it may be false.
Descriptions, however, differ in complexity.
In his discussion of truth and falsehood in Philosophy,
which was first published in 1927, Russell has developed a
different theory of correspondence, which he admits is
crude but which he thinks is in the right direction. He holds
that truth and falsity apply especially to statements, and
statements are divided into present statements and past
statements. The former are true when they correspond
with a present perception or with a recollection of a past
perception. The latter are true when the expectations they
aroused are confirmed by present perception. Hence state-
ments are closely related to beliefs. For they arouse ex-
pectations, and the feeling of expectedness is an' emotion.
A statement "is a form of words uttered or written with a
view to being heard or read by some other person." Hence
statements are intended to influence the conduct of others
"by producing a belief." Now truth applies primarily to
statements and only derivatively to beliefs. But since a
form of words is a social phenomenon, "truth must be
social." A statement is true when it corresponds to a cer-
tain fact. "A form of words is true if a person who knows
the language is led to that form of words when he finds
himself in an environment which contains features that are
the meanings of those words, and these features produce
reactions in him sufficiently strong for him to use words
which mean them. Thus 'a train leaves King's Cross at
10 A.M.' is true if a person can be led to say, 'It is now
10 a.m., this is King's Cross, and I see a train starting.'
The environment causes words and words caused directly
by the environment (if they are statements) are true"
(p. 262). Here we have Russell's latest statement of the
correspondence theory of truth.
B. Eaton's Statement of the Correspondence Theory*—
Ralph M. Eaton has given a more technical and detailed
statement of the correspondence theory in his Symbolism
and Truth. He holds that truth cannot be defined without
some reference to reality or existence, but that we must
adopt a restricted concept both of existence and of truth,
and be ready to change our concepts of both in the light
of later criticisms and discoveries. Truth and falsity are
especially connected with symbols as well as referring to
reality. When we build significant structures of symbols and
find them corresponding with reality, we have truth. But
concepts are not identical with the existents to which they
refer. There is an identity of structure only. The structure
of the system of concepts and the structure of the system
of objects to which it corresponds are identical. In Eaton's
own words: "The notion that the structure of thought is
found in the symbols it uses to express itself and that this
same structure permeates the world of real objects, at least
the real objects which can be presented in a consistent ex-
perience; the further notion that these real objects are not
identical with concepts and yet can be apprehended only by
the use of concepts, though they may in this way—even in
perception—be apprehended falsely; these ideas give a
complete and simple meaning to the definition of truth as
the correspondence of concepts to reality. . . . Truth
becomes in a literal sense a property of symbols, for propo-
sitions and concepts are symbols or symbolic groups as they
function in minds." 2

Press).
REALISM
C. A Critical Realist's Interpretation of the Correspond-
ence Theory of Truth.—A. K. Rogers has developed the
theory of correspondence which is especially characteristic
of critical realism in his little book entitled What is Truth?
(Yale Press). He distinguishes four aspects of the knowl-
edge situation which he thinks everyone must recognize
—thejndependently real object, the conscious state as an
actually existing mental entity, the meaning or idea, and the
mental act of referring the idea to the object. The mean-
ing is equivalent to Santayana's concept of essence, which
Rogers uses. Rogers finds it necessary to distinguish cer-
tain features of the meaning or essence. In the first place,
a meaning may be passive or active, by which he means the
distinction "between a meaning in the mind and having
this meaning." Secondly, this meaning which we have is
"actively referred to an external object." In this sense the
meaning is said to belong to the object and not to the mind.
These two senses of meaning—the particular content of
a conscious state and the universal description of an inde-
pendently real object—form an indivisible unity and that
unity is the essence. Now this essence, being identical in the
particular psychic or conscious state and in the object, the
two may be said to correspond, even though there is "very
little similarity" and even "a sharp discrepancy" between
them. For example: "I see a round table as round—round-
ness is part of its essence; my image meanwhile may have
the essence elliptical. So perceived distance—belonging to
the object's essence—may be represented in the analysis of
the mental state by characters far removed from its real
nature" (p. 71). In fact there need be no definite psychical
existent. The psychical or conscious state may be just a
feeling of asurance that we will reach "a point where some
specific experience will greet us as winding up happily and
successfully the active process." Thus, so-called imageless
thought, i.e., thinking where there is no definite psychical
image as a bearer of the meaning, is possible on this theory.
Rogers first applies this theory to a definition of true
perception, for example, in actually perceiving such a qual-
ity as redness. If we are experiencing a sensation of redness
at a given moment and are led to react to the stimulus, we
automatically and instinctively characterize the existing ob-
ject to which we react by redness, and in the future such an
object always means redness when it arouses that sensation.
In this case the essence of the psychical state and of the ob-
ject are identical, and this is true of all cases of perception.
"This character of the psychical state which the mind 'in-
tends' in its ideas must really be identifiable with the char-
acter of the object to which it is referred, or else in so far
our knowledge is in error; and if the essence in the two
cases is identical, the things which have such an identical
essence 'correspond'" (p. 68). Then Rogers applies the
theory to memory where we have to reconstruct "the true
nature of anything." In making such a reconstruction we
find ourselves balked unless we can call back the experience
from which we got the idea to begin with. And he also
applies it to the knowledge of another person's emotions,
using the example of fear. We can only know another's fear
by interpreting it in terms of our own experience of fear.
Then Rogers applies the theory to beliefs about the exter-
nal world. In all of these applications he insists that it is
identity of essence, as between the psychical state and the
object qualified by judgment, that makes knowledge pos-
sible. And this is correspondence. It even applies to our
knowledge of relations. "Unless the relationship can be
translated into some relational experience, the word is
seemingly left devoid of meaning; and apart from the sup-
position that just the character thus represented attaches
somehow to the real world itself, we should have no ground
for claiming that we know the relational structure of this
world at all" (p. 74). In proof that there is such a thing
as physical existence or nature Rogers falls back upon our
common-sense attitude when we face a tornado or a flood.
REALISM
In such experiences he cannot "resist the practical per-
suasion that there are real things and real forces that are
existences beyond him, and that set active limits to his
self-assertive will." And in the same way he falls back
upon common sense to prove psychical existence or mind.
In the experience of a vivid color sensation, or a painful
toothache, or any great emotion one cannot get away from
the fact that "there is existence here, stuff, brute fact that
cannot be resolved into relations, or activities, or any of
the philosophical devices for saving the ultimateness of
dialectics." And since common sense forces us to admit
both nature and mind as ultimately real, the correspondence
between them by way of the identity of their essences is the
only solution of the problem of truth.8
3. A Realist's Denial of Truth
Wrestling with the problem of truth has convinced some
of the realists that the only solution of the problem is the
denial that there is any such thing as truth. And they claim
that this denial is the true theory of truth! Here, then, is
a genuinely paradoxical realistic theory of truth. The best
representative of this extreme view is Theodore De Laguna,
whose untimely recent death was a great loss to American
philosophy. In what was probably the last paper that he
wrote for publication De Laguna defended this view. The
knowledge of real existence he regards as chimerical. All
reflection begins with human prejudices and "habitual ex-
pectations," and seeks to justify them. We support one be-
lief by appealing to others. "The only standard is the vague
and shifting standard afforded by our beliefs in general."
And further on he says: "One of the chief preoccupations
of two generations of philosophers has been the nature of
truth. It has been assumed without question that truth has
a nature—that is to say, that there is a common property
8 See my criticism of Roger's theory of truth in Principles of Reasoning.
2nd ed., pp. 3518. (Appleton).
which all true propositions possess and which all false pro-
positions lack. I have become convinced that this assumption
is groundless: that truth has no nature, and that there is no
property whatsoever that is common to, and peculiar to,
true propositions. Truth, I believe, is an expression which
has meaning only 'in use.' When a given proposition is said
to be true, we know what that means; but, as I understand
the matter, there is no meaning of truth in general—there
is no room for a theory of truth." 4 De Laguna explains
that he reached this suspicion that there is no truth by ob-
serving the long drawn-out controversy between pragma-
tists and absolute idealists, a controversy which "died away
in futile counter-charges and restatements." Indeed De
Laguna goes so far as to say that both sides "were guilty
of radical inconsistencies", and that "the controversy was
over a shadow."
4. A Realist's Pluralistic Theory of Truth
J. Loewenberg calls himself a problematic realist. In
dealing with the problem of truth he develops a highly in-
teresting and original pluralistic theory of truth, holding
that there is a "fourfold root of truth," and that each of
the classic theories represents one of those roots.
He begins his exposition with an analysis of the nature
of judgment—a question which he regards as one of the
most crucial questions of philosophy. This is because judg-
ment is a connecting link between truth and reality. It is
"the vehicle of truth in pursuit of reality." But it is by no
means simple. It is a composite and complex whole, an-
alyzable into four distinct fragments: (i) Every judgment
is the expression of some one's belief. This personal aspect
is a profound part of the nature of judgment and cannot
be ignored. (ii) Every judgment is "the discursive state-
ment" of the belief it embodies. It uses symbols to convey

p. 412. (Published by The Macmillan Company.)
REALISM
the meaning of the belief. Hence this is the formal aspect
of judgment, (iii) A judgment is what a person comes to
believe and to assert as a result of awareness, and this
awareness is the noetic aspect of judgment, (iv) Every
judgment is a description of that of which the believer is
aware, which may be either an object or a situation. De-
scription is the material aspect of judgment. Loewenberg
holds that all four of these aspects are always present in
every significant judgment. They are "distinguishable but
not separable."
Now when one of these aspects is isolated and made the
whole of judgment we get one theory of truth, and that is
the way the four traditional theories of truth have each
arisen. The pragmatist theory of truth makes belief cen-
tral. On this theory "that belief, the enactment of which is
functionally efficacious, is truly efficacious." Practicality is
here the standard. Since this emphasizes the adverb truly,
Loewenberg calls it the adverbial theory of truth. The
formal consistency theory of truth isolates the formal
aspect of judgment. Those propositions or beliefs are true
which are in "concordance" with one another. Here truth
is an independent body or system of propositions, and hence
Loewenberg calls this the substantival theory of truth. But
those who make the aspect of awareness fundamental make
truth "an inexpungible quality of awareness itself." Here
we have the traditional theory of self-evidence, which
Loewenberg calls the adjectival theory of truth, because it
makes truth a quality; and the names of qualities are adjec-
tival rather than substantival. The traditional correspond-
ence theory makes truth a relation between a judgment and
the material asserted in the judgment. Hence it erects the
material aspect of judgment into the fundamental nature of
judgment. Loewenberg calls this the bi-prepositional and
the hyphenated theory of truth.
Regardless of the correctness of these names, we must
recognize that truth can never rightly be identified with
one of these types to the exclusion of the others. But we
can only adequately recognize this by making truth essen-
tially a plastic and variable relation between a "problem"
and a "solution." On one level this variable truth-relation
can be correctly interpreted as a relation of workability, on
another as coherence, on a third as immediacy, and on a
fourth as correspondence. "What is there so disconcerting
about a diversity of incongruous views? It does not worry
me to look upon the world and life from different stand-
points, and I do not feel abashed because I cannot combine
them into a total and absolute perspective. ... I do not
feel the need of making a drastic choice or of uniting them
into a 'higher synthesis.' I find them equally relevant and
equally important." 5 I have called Loewenberg's theory a
pluralistic theory of truth, because he disclaims the view
that there is a type of truth which unites all four types.
His view is that all four types are equally true and must
be accepted by the philosopher at their face value, without
his attempting to synthesize them into one theory of truth.
It is, I think, obvious from Loewenberg's discussion that
the correspondence theory is regarded as a slightly higher
form of truth than the other three, for he speaks of each
theory holding true of a different level of experience, and
the highest level seems to be that of establishing a corre-
spondence between the judgment and the matter described
in it.
5. Realism and Error
The student will be able to work out the various theories
of error corresponding to these different theories of truth
which have been advocated by realists. For Alexander error
is "always in contact with reality and is partial truth."
There is mental error when "the erroneous judging is itself
a real enjoyment of the mind." For Russell and Eaton

(Macmillan). See his essay entitled "The Fourfold Root of Truth" in the
University of California Publications in Philosophy, Vol. X, pp. 209-241.
REALISM
falsity is due to lack of correspondence between the state-
ment or set of symbols and the reality to which it refers.
Rogers says that "the definition which critical realism gives
of error is briefly this: When we 'know' an object, we are
assigning a certain 'essence'—a character or group of char-
acters—to some reality existing independently of the knowl-
edge-process. And as truth is the identity of this essence
with the actual character of the reality referred to, so error
stands for the lack of such agreement, and the ascribing of
an ideal character to what we are mistaken in supposing
to be real, or the ascribing to a reality of a wrong char-
acter instead of a right one." 6 And it would follow from
De Laguna's denial of truth, either that there is no error
or that all human knowledge is erroneous. On a view like
Loewenberg's error would be defined differently for each
of the four theories of truth, but into these details we can-
not here enter.

REALISM'S SOLUTIONS OF THE BODY-MIND
PROBLEM
HE originator of realistic panpsychism was the Eng-
X lish naturalistic philosopher, W. K. Clifford (1845-
1879). He considered inner feeling to be the essence of
all reality. What a person perceives as feeling is to an
onlooker nervous tissue. But since we know our own brain
to be continuous with nature, and we experience the inner
side of it as feeling, we can extend this idea from the brain
to all of nature, and look upon everything whatsoever as
having an inner essence of feeling. Yet this feeling is not
a single world consciousness like the mind of an individual
human being. Such consciousness as we possess exists only
in organisms with a brain. We must look on nature as con-
sisting originally of separate, simple, tiny bits of mind-stuff.
Evolution gathers these up into unities of various types and
degree of complexity. This mind-stuff theory of Clifford has
had a wide appeal, and it is undoubtedly a primary source
of the panpsychism defended by contemporary realists.
Although William James subjected Clifford's mind-stuff
theory to criticism and rejected it, we have already learned
that he himself held that those entities not experienced by
any experiencer were all capable of having experiences
themselves (see above p. 161), thus giving a panpsychist
interpretation to his radical empiricism. C. A. Strong, an
ardent admirer and close student of James, has developed
this suggestion into a consistent realistic panpsychism. In
his recent Essays on the Natural Origin of the Mind,
1. Realistic Panpsychism

REALISM
(Macmillan, 1930), Strong deals with James's objections
to Clifford's mind-stuff theory, pointing out that they are
due to James's failure to distinguish between perceptions or
acts of awareness and feelings, and among the self, aware-
ness, and sense data. Hence he attempts to reconcile Clif-
ford's mind-stuff theory with James's panpsychism.
Strong's earlier book Why the Mind Has a Body
(Macmillan, 1903) points out that Clifford's mind-stuff
theory was a parallelistic form of panpsychism, since he
denied any causal connection between consciousness and the
brain. The two processes flow along side by side without
influencing each other, and this is strict parallelism. Strong
calls Clifford's view panpsychism, and he also acknowledges
his indebtedness to Fechner, and more especially to Paulsen
and G. F. Stout. And he adds: "What specially character-
izes my treatment of the matter is the detailed working out
of the conception in terms of the hypothesis of mental
causality." (Preface.)1
In his later The Origin of Consciousness (Macmillan,
1920) Strong makes an important analysis of the body-
mind problem into two distinct questions: (i) Do mind and
body act upon each other and, if so, what is the direction
of the causal influence? this being the question of causality;
and (ii) How are mind and body related as existents?, this
being the existential question. The traditional theories
have been principally concerned with the first question,
parallelism denying causal influence, automatism asserting
a one-way influence in its theory that the brain produces
consciousness, and interaction insisting upon a two-way in-
fluence. Panpsychism is chiefly concerned with the second
problem. Hence, as we learned in our discussion of idealistic
panpsychism, one may be a panpsychist and hold to any of

Geneva in 190+, on Quelques Considerations sur le panpsychisme, Strong
acknowledges his indebtedness to the English panpsychist, Alfred Barratt.
See Barratt's Physical Met empiric.
the various theories as to the causal relation of body and
mind.
Nevertheless in dealing with the causal problem Strong
treats panpsychism as a distinct theory from interaction,
automatism, and parallelism. He especially recommends
panpsychism because it is a higher synthesis of all three
of these theories. He writes: "At the time when my other
book was written I was aware that this fourth theory in-
volved a reconciliation of parallelism, if not with inter-
action, at least with a species of interaction. For though,
according to it, the mind, as parallelism asserts, never acts
on the brain (since it is the existence or a part of the exist-
ence that appears as the brain), yet on the other hand it
does interact with the existences that appear as the non-
cerebral parts of the body, and is far indeed from being
efficacious: so that the psychic efficacy which interactionism
had at heart is at least firmly established. Since my book
was published, it has become clear to me that if what we
refer to is not the mind or psyche as an existence but con-
sciousness, i.e. the function of awareness, then in regard to
this the thesis of the 'conscious automaton' theory is true,
and is by our fourth theory reconciled with the other two:
consciousness (not the datum of introspection, but the func-
tion) is indeed a passive resultant of the operation of the
brain or the existence that appears as a brain, and as inert
and inefficacious as the most advanced materialist could
desire. So that our panpsychist theory actually reconciles
with one another and takes up into itself all three of the
other causal theories—which is no small recommendation
for a psychophysical hypothesis" (p. 3 f.).
Yet it is the second problem that panpsychism solves
better than any other theory, and the solution of that prob-
lem is more fundamental to the solution of the body-mind
problem than is the solution of the causal problem. Strong
admits that his answer to this problem in his earlier book
REALISM
was too idealistic. By substituting in his later book the doc-
trine of direct perception for that of representative per-
ception he has been able to avoid this idealistic slant to the
theory and to develop a consistent realistic form of pan-
psychism. "I used to think of consciousness in the prevalent
way, as constituting the substance of the mind, but I now
see that something which I should call feeling or sentience
—and which is none other than mind-stuff—constitutes the
substance of the mind, and that consciousness is only its
function. What we introspect is not consciousness but feel-
ing or sentience" (p. n). This shows that Strong is now
much nearer to Clifford's mind-stuff theory than he is to
Paulsen's type of panpsychism. And this is further shown
by his statement: "Hence there is nothing for it, if the the-
ory is to be maintained, but to hold that the psyche is at
once psychic and extended" (p. 13). At present Strong
holds that there is but one existent, which, when looked at
from the inside is feeling or sentience, and when observed
from without is a brain process. "The essence of this theory
[panpsychism] is the identification of the existence known
to us in sense-perception, when what we perceive is the
brain-process, with the existence known in introspection"
(p. 12). This, then, is Strong's answer to the second ques-
tion and the fullest development of the realistic form of
panpsychism.
It is interesting to note that A. S. Eddington in The
Nature of the Physical World also defends Clifford's mind-
stuff theory. He quotes with approval Clifford's famous
statement: "The succession of feelings which constitutes a
man's consciousness is the reality which produces in our
minds the perception of his brain." Eddington says that we
are justified in interpreting the background of what we
experience as physical as having "a nature capable of mani-
festing itself as mental activity," and as "something of a
spiritual nature of which the prominent characteristic is
thought." 2 It is a striking fact that recent interpretations
of physical nature are more and more panpsychic, whereas
recent interpretations of psychical life are more and more
behavioristic and anti-psychic. This fact may be evidence
in favor of Kohler's contention that we are on the verge of
a discovery of major importance as to the relation of mind
and nature.3
2. The Cross-Section Theory of the New Realists
E. B. Holt has especially developed the theory of the
relation of body and mind which characterizes the Amer-
ican new realism. In his Concept of Consciousness he indi-
cates briefly the sources of this interesting theory. One of
these is the German philosopher, Avenarius, whose "phi-
losophy of pure experience" was built upon a denial of the
distinction between inner and outer experience. The new
realists follow Avenarius in this denial. Mach's Analysis of
Sensation, especially the "anti-metaphysical preliminaries,"
and James's essays that are republished in Essays in Radi-
cal Empiricism are the other sources, especially mentioned
by Holt. The basic idea in James's essays is the conception
of a stuff called "pure experience," out of which all transient
objects, including separate human consciousnesses, are con-
structed. In his Preface Holt gives H. M. Sheffer credit
for having named this stuff of pure experience "neutral
entities," meaning by the word neutral that these entities
are neither mental nor physical. We have already learned
that this theory of neutralism, which was first stated by
James, has influenced the American new realists and Ber-
trand Russell. Let us now consider the way in which Holt
uses this theory to solve the body-mind problem.
We must abandon the notion that there is a common
substance underlying all being. Clinging to this false as-

REALISM
sumption is what has given rise to spiritualism on the
one hand and to materialism on the other hand. The realm
of being is not a realm of substances but a class of purely
neutral entities, more logical or conceptual in nature than
substantial or material. The problem, then, is how such a
purely neutral universe can contain both mental and phys-
ical objects. We must think of these entities that make up
the realm of being as graded in the order of complexity.
The simple neutral entities are relations like identity, dif-
ference, number, negativity, and all entities that are "rela-
tively universal," as contrasted with those that are particu-
lar and relatively concrete. Now as the entities become
more complex, new objects arise. Physical objects arise
when the complexity is that of the world of mechanics and
chemistry. Living beings arise when the complexity is that
of the world of biology. Minds arise when the complexity
is that of the world of psychology. And Holt thinks that
"these neutral entities are marvellously compacted in a
united system such that the simple develop without break
or discontinuity into the more and more complex, even
down to the infinite diversity of concrete being" (p. 164).
So much for the graded series of neutral entities, which is
the background of Holt's cross-section theory of mind or
consciousness.
By a cross-section Holt means "any definable part that
is in no wise organically related to the whole." Here he is
denying the idealistic doctrine of the internality of rela-
tions. His examples are: "the mauve-colored postage stamps
in a philatelist's album, the particles of matter lying in the
plane of the earth's orbit," etc. But every organism is such
a cross-section, in that organisms respond to certain fea-
tures of the environment and not to others. The mechanism
of this response is the nervous system in animals having
one, but even plants respond to their environment selec-
tively. For example, there are numerous mechanisms of
response in plants such as "baro-, helio-, thermo-, chemo-,
and galvano-tropisms," and each defines a certain cross-
section of the plant's environment. But plants have organs
of sensitivity, of conduction, and of contraction which also
give other cross-sections of the plant's environment than
those given by plant tropisms. If we put all of these cross-
sections together and think of them as one, then in the case
of some particular plant, "the complete cross-section that
is so defined, constitutes all, or very nearly all, of the plant's
environment that for it has any existence. For the plant any
other portions of the surrounding world are not. Yet the
plant remains itself an organism that is distinct from this
effective environment" (p. 175 f).
Now an animal cross-section is similar to that of a plant,
only its field is much more extensive. This is to say, it in-
cludes a much larger number of objects in the environment.
But those objects to which a plant responds are not all phys-
ical, even though we call both the plant and its environ-
ment physical. Hence "the plant's cross-section is as neutral
a manifold as any purely mathematical system; yet this
cross-section, we have seen, is all that there is by way of
environment for the plant. It is therefore not a stretching
of the facts, but an inevitable concession to reason and to
common sense, to say that the plant lives and moves in a
purely neutral realm" (p. 179). And so of an animal
organism. And so likewise of a human mind. Conscious-
ness depends upon the nervous system, but it is not inside
of the nervous system, or seated in the brain. Conscious-
ness is a cross-section of the environment. "Now this neu-
tral cross-section outside of the nervous system, and
composed of the neutral elements of physical and non-
physical objects to which the nervous system is responding
by some specific response,—this neutral cross-section, I sub-
mit, coincides exactly with the list of objects of which we
say that we are conscious. This neutral cross-section as
defined by the specific reaction of reflex-arcs is the psychic
REALISM
realm:—it is the manifold of our sensations, perceptions
and ideas:—it is consciousness" (p. 182).
Holt thinks that consciousness is spatially and temporally
extended. He uses an interesting analogy to clarify this.
Imagine a sheet with a hole in it. Let the hole vary both
in size and shape, and let the sheet be moved about over a
map. Then "the sum of the places disclosed by the hole
would be, like consciousness, a manifold having spatial
extent and at the same time moving in space" (p. 211).
On this view, then, the same neutral entities are conscious-
ness or mind when they form the cross-section determined
by the response of some nervous system, and physical when
they form a cross-section determined by some other mech-
anism or focus. Both mental and physical cross-sections are
parts of the same universe of neutral entities.
3. The Solution of the Body-Mind Problem of the
Emergent Evolutionists
Samuel Alexander admits that Holt's cross-section the-
ory of consciousness (which he also calls the searchlight
theory because Holt compares consciousness to the field of
a searchlight) is "so simple as almost to compel assent."
He also says that it is so close to the facts that he finds
himself "perpetually being drawn back and persuaded to
adopt it." Yet he does not adopt it. For he thinks that we
know that every object of which we are conscious belongs
to our experience. If consciousness is simply identical
with the cross-section, how is it that we have self-conscious-
ness in the sense that we enjoy our own mental acts?
"Every act of consciousness is then self-consciousness, not
in the sense of containing a reflection on itself, for this is
just what is denied by calling it an enjoyment, but in the
sense that whenever we know, we know that we know, or
that knowing and knowing that we know are one and the
same thing. Now if consciousness belongs not to the neural
response but to the cross-section itself which it makes, as a
totality, how can any object be my object? And yet experi-
ence says that it is." 4 In other words, Alexander is unwilling
to accept Holt's denial of inner experience or his reduction
of inner to outer experience. If we take away from con-
sciousness the specific relation to a self, and make it con-
sist simply in a cross-section of objects in the environment,
then any such cross-section would be consciousness, and
there would be no distinct level of reality which emerges in
mind.
Hence Alexander, Morgan, and other emergent evolu-
tionists are committed to the view that mind emerges as one
of the higher levels of reality, after lower levels have
emerged as a basis for it. Morgan distinguishes three dis-
tinct levels of mind as an emergent. There is the subcon-
scious level which lies below the level of sense perception,
and there is the self-conscious level which lies above the
level of sense perception. We should only use the word
consciousness to refer to this highest level of mind. This
exists only in human beings and in beings higher than man
who are capable of reflection. But mind in the subconscious
form is present in plants. Is it present in the levels lower
down than plants? The emergent evolutionists are really
committed to the view that there are two sides of every
emergent level, one of which is like the mental life of
human beings only in a much more rudimentary form, and
the other of which is like the physiological side of human
nature. Is this panpsychism? Or is it simply parallelism?
Morgan calls it the theory of unrestricted correlation. But
it is essentially the same as the parallelistic form of pan-
psychism. Thus Morgan writes: "There is a correlated psy-
chical system in the atom, the molecule, the crystal, the
bacterium, the fertilized ovum—in every differentiated
physical system, according to its integral status in the evo-
lutionary hierarchy." And further on he adds: "There is,
at no level, any interaction between the physical and psy-

REALISM
chical attributes." 6 And these two statements epitomize
parallelistic panpsychism.
4. Pratt's Interactionism
In his Taylor Lectures, entitled Matter and Spirit (The
Macmillan Co.), J. B. Pratt subjects parallelism, panpsy-
chism, and materialism to criticism, and reaches the conclu-
sion that "none of the theories opposed to Interaction are
tenable, and none of the objections to Interaction are im-
portant." Having eliminated all other theories and the
objections to interaction, he concludes that interaction is
the true solution of the body-mind problem. This leads him
to the important question: What are they that interact?
In dealing with this question Pratt develops the idea that
the material world consists of one type of process, and that
this process holds absolute sway throughout the infinite
recesses of physical nature. But here on the earth we know
that selves or personalities have evolved, and we also know
that their behavior exhibits another type of process. Con-
sequently we must recognize that human beings exhibit a
dualism of process, and that the two types of process are in
mutual interaction in human conduct. "Many of the activi-
ties of the body take place according to purely physical
laws. But not all. The determining power in some of the
acts of human bodies is to be found not in the physical and
chemical processes but in processes of an utterly different
nature, namely, those of the rational and purposive will.
At many a juncture personal will, reason, purpose interfere
with the working of mechanical law and contravene it. Of
course the resulting action of the human body in question
will be capable, after the fact, of being described in me-
chanical terms. But it was not caused by mechanical forces
or conditions, it was not a part of any regular mechanical
sequence, and it never could have been predicted by the

Philosophy, pp. 403 and 404.

most miraculously omniscient mechanist, even if he had
been in possession of all the facts and all the laws of the
physical universe" (p. 186). Pratt holds that this dualism
of process is "as old as man's thought." He calls it "the
Philosophy of the Human Race."
5. Cohen's Theory of Automatism
Years ago T. H. Huxley put forth the theory that mind
is correlated with the brain and that consciousness is
restricted to beings having a brain. Morgan calls Huxley's
view restricted correlation to contrast it with the unre-
stricted correlation which he defends. It has also been
called epiphenomenalism, by which is meant that the mind
or consciousness is a mere by-product of the functioning of
the brain. On this theory the causal relation between brain
and mind is a one-way relation. Mind is the effect and brain
is the cause. Never does mind act on the brain. It is a mere
epiphenomenon of the brain. This is the theory which
Strong called the "conscious automaton" theory.
M. R. Cohen, in his recent Reason and Nature (Har-
court, Brace & Co.) examines the different theories of the
mind-body relation and reaches the conclusion that the con-
scious automaton view is substantially correct. He thinks
there is no doubt that "if we bring about certain bodily
states, we shall also have their mental accompaniments.
And this is a most important fact of all human life, since
all education and the influencing of our fellow men de-
pends upon choosing the right physical expression or means
to bring about the desired mental state" (p. 325). But
Cohen immediately denies that the causality here asserted
means what it means in physics or physiology. We do not
know what the nature of this causality is, but the fact that
consciousness is qualitatively different from the data of
physics and physiology is proof that the causality by which
the brain produces the mind is different from that by which
it produces a bodily movement.
REALISM
6. Realism and Freedom and Immortality
We have space only to indicate the attitude of realists to
the question of the freedom of the human will. Strong dis-
tinguishes between empirical and speculative freedom. By
the former he means the experience which he thinks every-
body has of choosing between various alternative actions
and of taking one's own sweet time to do it. By the latter
he means "the uncausedness of our decisions." We can
never know this. We can only speculate about it. Empirical
freedom is entirely consistent with universal causation and
in no way depends upon speculative freedom. We only need
to insist that "will, which is the active aspect of some parts
of reality, must have the genuine though limited efficacy
that belongs to it as a force among other forces." It is cer-
tainly strange that a panpsychist should admit that sen-
tience or feeling belongs to absolutely every existent and
should say that will is only "the active aspect of some parts
of reality" and "a force among other forces," but that is
exactly what Strong says. Pratt holds essentially the same
view, but it is more consistent with his form of interaction
than it is with Strong's panpsychism. Holt denies that there
is any antithesis between free will and determinism, and in-
sists that every one is free "whose acts fulfill his purposes."
This he calls practical freedom. "The question whence come
his purposes is as irrelevant and meaningless as some others
that we have seen;—whither go the shapes of bursting bub-
bles?" (p. 295). Morgan and Alexander connect their
theory of freedom with their theory of emergence. They
believe that every new act, as well as every new emergent,
has an indeterminate character. Each is unpredictable and
therefore each is free.6 Cohen insists that the consciousness
of human freedom is entirely consistent with the "discov-

gence" in the Hibbert Journal, July 1929. For the quotation from Strong and
on his theory of freedom in general see the Epilogue of his The Origin of
Consciousness.
erable uniformities" which characterize human conduct. He
accepts Peirce's tychism—the theory that there is absolute
novelty both in physical and in psychical nature.
As far as belief in immortality is concerned few realists
accept it. The word immortality seldom occurs in their
writings. Their naturalistic conception of consciousness
really precludes the acceptance of belief in personal im-
mortality. Alexander frankly says: "If we are to follow
the clue of experience, we must therefore believe that the-
oretically the claim for the future life is founded on error"
(Vol. II, p. 424). Pratt comes nearer than any other realist
to accepting the belief in immortality. He writes: "Only a
dualistic philosophy is compatible with any significant form
of immortality. But such a philosophy is not only compat-
ible with it; it goes a long way toward making it probable."
In fact Pratt thinks it is probable, and that Plato's argu-
ments in the Phaedo are a sound proof for it.
REALISM'S SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF
VALUE AND EVIL
i. A Classification of Realistic Theories of Value
REALISTS have developed at least five distinct theo-
ries of value, three of which may be classified under
one general theory, the relational theory. The first form
of the relational theory is the interest theory of value. It
defines value as a relation between any object whatever and
the interest which that object satisfies. Value is created
whenever any interest is fulfilled, and negative value arises
from the thwarting of interest. John Laird calls this the
"appreciative theory," since he identifies an interest with an
act of appreciation; but R. B. Perry objects because "the
term 'appreciation' encourages a confusion between liking,
desiring, etc., and deeming good, i.e., judging." So let us
call this the interest form of the relational theory. Another
form is to make value a relation of any entity to the self-
maintenance of any other entity whatever. Those things
that have natural affinities for each other stand in a value
relation. Laird calls this the elective theory of value, be-
cause one thing is said to elect or prize the other in a
natural way. A third form of the relational theory is the
comparative theory of value. This has been briefly set forth
by A. P. Brogan in articles which he has contributed to the
International Journal of Ethics. It will be more fully de-
veloped in a book on the comparative theory of value which
is to be published shortly. According to Brogan the funda-
mental value concept is the relation of betterncss and
worseness. There is no proof that the value series is finite,
212
213
or that there is an absolute best at one end of the series.
If there were an absolute best, there would also have to be
an absolute worst. Value is simply the comparison of one
entity with another from the standpoint of betterness.1 A
fourth theory Laird calls the timological theory of value.
The word timology is of Greek derivation, and means liter-
ally the science of honor or dignity or excellence. Hence this
theory defines value in terms of wholeness, excellence, per-
fection. On this view value is the unique grouping of entities
into a unified whole which has natural excellence. Those
realists who find all of these four theories unsatisfactory
fall back upon an indefinability theory of value. They hold
that every attempt to define value involves one in an un-
avoidable equivocation between value as immediate expe-
rience and standard value, or between instrumental and
intrinsic value.
We may summarize these realistic theories of value in a
classificatory scheme:
FA. The Interest Theory.
I. Relational Theories of Value. -j B. The Elective Theory.
II. The Timological Theory.
III. The Indefinability Theory.
The Comparative Theory.
Now let us expound each of these theories more at length,
with the exception of the comparative theory, since it is not
yet fully developed.
2. The Interest Theory of Value
Among the American new realists R. B. Perry has given
most attention to the working out of a realistic theory of
value. In 1914 he published an important essay entitled
A Definition of Value in which he laid down the funda-

pp. 254-271, and Vol. XXXV, pp. 105-124. See my criticism of Brogan's
theory in the same journal, Vol. XXXIV, pp. 175-194.
REALISM
mental principles of the theory. And in 1926 appeared his
General Theory of Value, with the subtitle: Its Meaning
and Basic Principles Construed in Terms of Interest
(Longmans). In the Preface he promises a sequel to be
entitled Realms of Value, but that work has not yet ap-
peared. The General Theory of Value is a monumental
work which has produced a great deal of discussion, and
Perry has since written some important articles to defend
and to clarify his fundamental thesis.2 Thus he has devoted
the best years of his mature life to the working out of this
highly original and important theory of value.
The whole theory is determined by the unique conception
of interest, which some of Perry's critics persist in misun-
derstanding, in spite of his clear statements of the sense in
which he uses the term. In his original statement of the
theory he speaks of a "certain constant that we may call
bias or interest," and he especially stresses the fact that
this has "manifold varieties, conditions and relations." And
he adds: "The central fact for this view is the polarity of
affective-motor attitudes." These various attitudes, such as
love and hate, hope and fear, desire and repugnance, Perry
generalizes under the terms liking and disliking. And then
he says: "I shall use the term interest to mean a subject's
liking or disliking, including also their derived or disposi-
tional forms." 3 And in his General Theory of Value he
writes: "It is to this all-pervasive characteristic of the
motor-affective life, this state, act, attitude or disposition
of favor or disfavor, to which we propose to give the name
interest." Then, in a footnote, he points out that this is a
technical use of the term interest, which is used by no one
"in the precise sense in which it is employed here"
(p. 115).
This shows how extremely important it is to an under-

and Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XXVIII, pp. 447-484 and 519-526.

standing of Perry's theory to grasp exactly what he means
by an interest. And from his two definitions it is perfectly
clear that the term is highly elastic, applicable to the sim-
plest conceivable case of liking or disliking, such as a
plant's heliotropisms, or to a highly complex state of ap-
preciation, such as a sage's enjoyment of the pure abstract
idea of beauty, as described by Socrates in Plato's Sympo-
sium. Hence Perry's critics are undoubtedly wrong in
restricting this term to human and higher animal likings
and dislikings. But they are right in saying that it applies
only to living phenomena. Perry's theory of value is pre-
dominantly a biological theory, and to call it a psychological
theory, as Laird does, is misleading, unless one remembers
that Perry shares Holt's view that there is a conscious
cross-section defined by a plant's heliotropisms. For the new
realists recognize no real gap, so far as valuing is con-
cerned, between the liking of a plant and that of a sage.
The satisfaction of either liking constitutes value.
However, Perry especially insists that the satisfaction of
any interest by any object whatsoever defines generic value
only. There are admittedly many modes or types of value.
But on Perry's theory every one of these modes or types
contains generic value or is constituted by the satisfaction
of interest. Let us briefly consider three important modes
of value at the level of plant life. Suppose a plant subject
M, and let it have an interest r, say the plant's liking light.
Let the object a be the falling of the sun's rays upon this
particular plant. This gives us one mode of value. There is
a single interest r and a single object a and a is in the
relation of satisfying r. Now let us complicate the situa-
tion by adding another interest s and another object b
and s may be the liking of the plant for water and b the
gentle rain falling upon the plant. This gives us two values
of the same mode. When the sun shines on the plant value
is created, and when the rain falls on the plant value is cre-
ated. But suppose, now, that there has been a prolonged
REALISM
drought, and that the sun has been shining too intensely for
too long a time on this particular plant. Then the interest
s and its object b will take precedence over the interest
r and its object a. This preference of one interest to
another by a subject defines another mode of value. A third
mode is defined by the relation of something to a or b,
which is calculated to bring a or b into, or to put it out of,
existence. Let us call this c. Suppose that rain is delayed,
and a man turns a hose on the plant. Then turning the hose
on the plant is c, since it brings water into existence for
the plant. Now, if the plant could know that c could take
the place of b it would have a liking for c. But even though
it does not know this we can say that c has value in a de-
rived sense. Its characteristic effect being the satisfaction
of an interest, it has value. Here, then, are three modes of
value, each of which retains the generic nature of value as
the relation between any interest and any object. And we
have exemplified all three modes at the level of plant life
to show how erroneous those interpretations of Perry's
theory are which restrict interest to man and the higher
animals. It is not so restricted. The term interest applies
to any kind of liking or disliking whatsoever, to any kind
of affective-motor attitude whatsoever, even though it be
that of a plant. That is why Perry italicised the words
"state, act, attitude or disposition of favor or disfavor,"
and that is why he uses the word affective-motor, instead
of affective-volitional, and the word bias. Of course, the
three modes of value explained above, and other modes,
become highly important at the human level. One of the
great merits of Perry's theory is that it enables him to
treat economic, moral, aesthetic, cognitive, social, and reli-
gious values as species of generic value.
Perry uses his interest theory, therefore, as a new prin-
ciple of classifying values. He especially condemns the axi-
ological classification used by Urban and other idealists,
and expounded above. (Part II, Chap. VI.) It is based
upon the norms or standards by which values are graded
and validated. But the best way to classify values is in terms
of the various modes of interest, or in terms of the different
relations objects may have to interests. The three modes
distinguished above are based upon the former. Other dis-
tinctions that are possible and valuable, each of which
yields different classifications, are "positive and negative,
progressive and recurrent, potential and actual, independ-
ent and dependent, playful and real, submissive and
aggressive, subjective and objective, immediate and medi-
ate, or personal and social" (p. 693). Using such princi-
ples of division we may classify, either the objects that are
in relation to interests, or the interests themselves. Perry
admits that the varieties of interest are so numerous that
this method perforce becomes excessively detailed and
schematic. So it is better to recognize that "the great foci
of interest are science, conscience, art, industry, state and
church," and to group the infinite varieties of value under
these basic categories. Thus, so far as human values are
concerned, there would be cognitive, moral, aesthetic, eco-
nomic, political or social, and religious values.
3. The Elective Theory of Value
John Laird, in The Idea of Value (Cambridge Univer-
sity Press), objects to Perry's view as being too narrow in
that it restricts value to interest in the psychological sense.
We have already made it clear that this is a misinterpre-
tation of Perry's theory, if by value we mean generic value
only. Perry's theory of generic value undoubtedly has a
much wider scope than Laird recognizes. However, it does
not extend lower down in the order of nature than living
beings. The relation of a magnet to iron filings, for exam-
ple, would not be, according to Perry, a value relation un-
less some interest were involved which would make it a
derived value as defined above. But on the natural election
theory such a relation would be a value. Consequently
Laird is right in holding that the natural election theory
has a wider scope than, and includes, the interest theory,
even though he is wrong in narrowing the interest theory
down to psychological interest or to such interests as are
found only among men and the higher animals. What the
natural election theory does is to assume that all natural
entities show bias or non-indifference towards some other
entities. A crystal shows this non-indifference towards its
environment and the process of crystal formation is an
example of natural election. Another good example would
be the process of osmosis in chemistry, or any other chem-
ical process, for that matter. In other words, we know that
non-living entities, as well as living organisms, exhibit the
phenomenon of mutual attraction and repulsion for each
other. This non-indifference of one entity for another,
whether living or non-living, which is so general through-
out nature, Laird calls natural election. And value is defined
in terms of this relation by the natural election theory.
Natural election is a principle of the widest possible exten-
sion, since there is nothing whatsoever that does not stand
in the relation of non-indifference to something else.
Laird distinguishes two ways in which natural election
works. One of these he calls logical relevance. If we are
asked what logical relevance is, we cannot tell. "Discrimina-
tion of a subtle and orderly kind between what is relevant
and what is immaterial presupposes the truth that there is
such a thing as relevance; and relevance itself, being a con-
dition of all logic, has ultimately to be accepted in its stark
and primitive purity" (p. 96). Thus logical relevance is
indefinable. Another form which natural election takes is
causation. This is also ultimately indefinable, but in any
case of actual causation we have to distinguish between
what counts and what does not count, and this is equivalent
to natural election. Some entities belong together, others
do not. "A thing sustains itself by taking account of other
things, assimilating some of them, neutralizing some of
219
them, assuming amicable or defensive relations with others
—and all non-mentally (as Bacon showed) as well as
(sometimes) mentally" (p. 99).
Laird goes on to show that this natural election may be
"altogether infra-conscious, and discoverable in things that
are not conscious at all, although, to be sure, it is also dis-
coverable in conscious beings and in their conscious experi-
ence" (p. 100). It is obvious that Laird is not a panpsy-
chist. The only characteristic of natural election necessary
to value is active selection, plus a response on the part of
that which is selected to that selection. The basis of all
natural election is the specific varieties which actually exist
in the universe. But "to speak of the 'universe' employ-
ing natural election is nonsense. The universe cannot take
sides or take special account of anything. Natural election,
on the contrary, describes the way in which particular things
do take sides, and do take special account, not of every-
thing, but of certain particular things and not of others"
(p. 113). Evidently Laird is not a monist nor an absolutist,
but a pluralist in so far as he accepts the natural election
theory of value.
Thus this theory is wider in its scope than the interest
theory. Yet it shares with that theory the character of being
relational. On both theories every value is a specific relation
of one entity to another. On the interest theory one of these
entities must be an interest in the technical sense of bio-
logical bias. On the elective theory it need not be an inter-
est in either the biological or the psychological sense. A
magnet attracting iron filings, and their responding by
clinging to the magnet, creates a value on this theory, as
much as an amoeba engulfing a food particle, or a man
appreciating Raphael's Madonna. Laird says: "One nat-
ural election is just as specific as another," and would this
not mean that value is created whenever natural election
occurs?
REALISM
4. The Timological Theory of Value
The natural election theory defines value with special
reference to some particular point of view. Thus, when a
lion catches a child, value is created from the point of view
of the lion. If the child escapes from the lion, value is cre-
ated from the point of view of the child. Here, then, are
two elective goods that are in contradiction. Now the timo-
logical theory of value is concerned primarily with what is
good in itself, apart from any particular point of view. Can
we say that the good of the child's escape is a higher excel-
lence than the good of the child's capture? If so, we must
have a rational insight by which we detect a greater excel-
lence in one value than in another. From this standpoint
we may have to condemn some natural elections as worth-
less or even as evil. Hence there is a fundamental and irrec-
oncilable opposition between the theory which defines value
in terms of natural election and interest, and the theory
which defines value in terms of excellence.
How can we define excellence? That it is a fact of expe-
rience no one can deny. Laird quotes the beautiful lines of
Ben Jonson to show that excellence does not mean spatial
magnitude or long duration.
For what is life, if measur'd by the space,
Not by the act? . . .
It is not growing like a tree
In bulk, doth make men better be:
Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,
To fall a log at last, dry, bald and sere:
A lily of a day
Is fairer far in May,
Although it fall and die that night:
It was the plant and flower of light.
In small proportions we just beauties see;
And in short measures life may perfect be.
How are we to define such excellences as this poem claims
for the lily of a day, the small proportions of a Diirer's
Crucifixion, or the short measures of a child's life?
221
More than any other realist G. E. Moore has wrestled
with this problem. He thinks that intrinsic value or good
z per se is a predicate of wholes, of "organic unities." Yet
there is no single predicate which all such wholes or unities
have, except that any rational being would judge that it
"would be better for such a unity to exist quite alone and
all by itself, than for it not so to exist. Hence every excel-
lence, every intrinsic value, is absolutely unique, and is con-
stituted by the peculiar organization which it has as an
organic unity. Moore calls this the "internality" of value.
Every intrinsic value is self-dependent. It is held together
internally by relations which make it an organic unity. And
the intrinsic value is the value of the whole in distinction
from the values of the separate parts entering into its con-
stitution. And "to hold that any kinds of value are 'intrin-
sic' entails the recognition of a kind of predicate extremely
different from any we should otherwise have to recognize,
and perhaps unique." This predicate Moore defines as fol-
lows: "To say that a kind of value is 'intrinsic' means
merely that the question whether a thing possesses it, and
in what degree it possesses it, depends solely on the in-
trinsic nature of the thing in question." And he explains
that he means by "depends solely on the intrinsic nature of
the thing in question" two things: (i) "That it is impos-
sible for what is strictly one and the same thing to possess
that kind of value at one time, or in one set of circum-
stances, and to possess it in a different degree in another,
or in a different set." In other words, once an intrinsic value
always one and to exactly the same degree. (ii) "If a
given thing possesses any kind of intrinsic value in a certain
degree, then not only must that same thing possess it, under
all circumstances, in the same degree, but also anything
exactly like it, must, under all circumstances, possess it in
exactly the same degree." 4 Yet intrinsic value must not
be regarded as a quality or property of a whole, for that
4 G. E. Moore: Philosophical Studies, pp. 26of. (Harcourt, Brace 4 Co.)
REALISM
would make it a part of that whole which would have to
be included in a complete description of it. But we can give
a complete description of an organic unity which possesses
intrinsic value without having to mention that value. Con-
sequently the value cannot be a quality or property of the
organic unity. And that is exactly why Moore said above,
that it is a unique predicate.
What, then, does Moore's timological theory of value
say that intrinsic value or excellence is? It is a peculiar
predicate, different from any other, of organic unities. It
is not identical with the values of the separate properties
or constituents of such wholes, but belongs to the peculiar
way in which they are internally organized. This is as far
as we can go towards defining it. And it is obvious that this
is a timological rather than a relational theory of value.
5. The Indefinability Theory of Value
We saw that Laird admits that natural election is a prin-
ciple that is ultimately indefinable, and that Moore admits
that the unique predicate of organic unities which consti-
tutes them excellences is ultimately indefinable. Thus both
of these theories rest back upon an indefinable surd in the
nature of value. Laird and Moore both admit this, and in
the end both acknowledge that value is really indefinable.
Laird says that "value is an ambiguous term which includes
both elective or appreciative prizings and timological in-
sight." By timological insight he means recognition of the
excellence in any organic unity. And he adds: "In view of
the admitted ambiguity of 'value' in the current speech of
so many nations, it should not be at all surprising if the
attempt to bring precision into the idea of value should end
with a less extensive but more acute ambiguity. And I sus-
pect that it does" (loco citato p. 322). Santayana also de-
fends the indefinability theory of value. This theory has
also been ably defended by S. C. Pepper in two essays en-
titled The Equivocation of Value and Standard Value
published in the University of California Publications in
Philosophy, Vols. IV and VII. Pepper says: "The gulf
yawns between immediate and standard value. It cannot be
bridged from the former to the latter nor from the latter
to the former. It cannot be bridged at all" (Vol. IV, p.
132),
Thus the realists are unable to solve the problem of
value so as to do justice both to relative and to absolute
value, both to instrumental and to intrinsic value. Either
they reduce all values to the relational type, as in the inter-
est, elective, and comparative theories, or they accept two
distinct types of value and admit that they are incompatible
and irreconcilable.
6. Realism and the Problem of Evil
On the interest theory of value evil is negative value,
and that means that it is the thwarting of a liking or the
satisfying of a disliking. But there is no problem of evil
except how to bring about a gradual betterment of the
world so that the total quantum of interest satisfaction can
be augmented. On the natural election theory evil is only
evil from the point of view of the being that loses its ex-
istence in the struggle of each actuality to maintain itself.
Thus what is evil from the point of view of the fly is good
from the point of view of the spider which catches the fly
in its web. On the comparative theory evil is defined by the
betterness-worseness relation, and is simply a matter of de-
gree of value in comparison with some other relative value.
On the timological theory there are degrees of excellence,
but there is no intrinsic evil. On the contrary, things that
would be evil taken each by itself can each be good in some
organic unity which has intrinsic value. In general real-
ists are uninterested in the traditional problem of reconcil-
ing the existence of evil facts with the supposed goodness
of God, since they either deny that there is a God or treat
deity as a quality yet to emerge and which is "beyond good
and evil." In fact, the realists boast of the superiority of
realism over idealism because of the fact that the only
problem of evil that realism has is how to get rid of it.
TYPICAL OBJECTIONS TO REALISM
f. General Criticisms of Realism
ONE of the fundamental defects in realism as a philoso-
phy is its extreme and exaggerated emphasis on the
critical function of philosophy. We have seen that the new
realism arose as a polemic against idealism, and that criti-
cal realism arose as a polemic against the new realism. Both
forms of American realism have been dominantly and pre-
eminently critical of everything and everybody, often to the
point of sheer dogmatism and absolute intolerance. And the
English realists, Russell, Broad, Moore, and Laird, have
been especially noted for their critical acumen. Only White-
head and Alexander have proceeded in a purely construc-
tive way, subordinating criticism to the building up of a
consistent view. Other realists have relied too much on the
type of argument which concludes that a view is true be-
cause other views are defective. And too often the other
view is a "straw man." In traditional Aristotelian logic this
type of argument is known as the fallacy of ad ignorantiam.
E. B. McGilvary, himself one of the ablest of the Amer-
ican realists, has well expressed this defect in realism.
"There has without doubt," he says, "been too much cock-
sureness all around. The monist has been dogmatic in as-
serting his monism [he means realistic monism], and the
dualist no less dogmatic in asserting his dualism. A more
cautious, tentative, postulational attitude is in order, to-
gether with an attempt at a sympathetic understanding of
the positions of opponents. This means of course trying to
understand any concept of an opponent in the context of the
225
REALISM
whole system of his concepts." 1 Yet none of the realists
enjoys exercising his critical acumen any more than Mc-
Gilvary, and none has offered any more acute and trench-
ant criticisms of his opponents' positions. And it was he who
said: "I feel like the Irishman who, seeing a fight, took off
his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and asked whether it was a
private fight, or whether anybody might get in." And
judged by the volume of their critical output, most of the
realists must feel like that same Irishman.
Now one may fully appreciate the value of philosophic
controversy and polemics as a method of clarifying issues,
of bringing new problems to light and of revitalizing
philosophy, without erecting controversy into the funda-
mental principle of philosophic method, as A. O. Lovejoy,
for example, does when he says "Effective cooperation
among philosophers consists, it is true, primarily in dis-
agreement." As a matter of fact most of the really great
philosophers, who stand out above the dust raised by their
contemporary controversialists like a mountain peak above
the clouds of mist which envelop its base, were thinkers
who developed their original ideas constructively rather
than critically. This is even true of Kant, the critical phi-
losopher par excellence, as is indicated by his famous
acknowledgment that it was David Hume who awoke him
from his dogmatic slumbers. One has a right, if not a duty,
to be suspicious of a type of philosophy which is always
attacking the positions of its opponents. The sounder atti-
tude is that of trying to see how much of the opponent's
position can be absorbed by the view which you hold. But
few of the realists are able to rise above the controversial
and to assume the synoptic or synthetic attitude. One can
but wonder how much of the present-day popularity of real-
ism may be due to that type of curiosity which makes one
turn aside to watch a good fight. For does not all the world
love a fighter, as well as a lover? But in the interest of
1 Philosophical Review, Vol. XL, p. 265.
philosophy, is it not high time for some one to try to stop
the fight?
In answer to this general criticism it may rightly be said
that realism is a philosophy that is just in its infancy, and
that it has had to do its fair share of kicking in order to
win for itself "a local habitation and a name." Undoubt-
edly there is truth in this retort, for idealism was so
strongly entrenched when the realists began their polemic
of reform, that fighting was necessary to break the bonds
of pedantry which were mumming philosophy. Yet is it not
a confession of weakness to admit that your philosophy is
still in its swaddling clothes? Hocking is unquestionably
right when he says: "No consistent realistic system is yet
forthcoming." Realism has yet to produce an intelligible,
consistent and unified answer to the basic problems of phi-
losophy. Some of these problems it deliberately shoves to
one side and boasts of the fact. On others, as we have seen,
conflicting interpretations and solutions are offered. This
proves that realism is as yet in its infancy, and that it must
sooner or later stop fighting and settle down to hard, con-
structive work, if it is to produce a durable system of phi-
losophy.
Although realists have fought idealism vigorously, they
have not infrequently attacked it from without, and then
have attempted to incorporate its fundamental insights as
though they were essentially realistic. Two illustrations of
this attitude must here suffice. Santayana states the essence
of absolutism as follows: "We are not really native to this
world, except in respect to our bodies; our souls are native
to a spiritual world, from which we fetch our standards of
truth and beauty, and in which alone we can be happy."
Then he subjects this position to his inimitable ridicule. Yet
when he comes to state his own view, he writes: "Although
intellect arises quite naturally, in the animal act of dominat-
ing events in the interest of survival, yet essentially intellect
disengages itself from that servile office (which is not that
REALISM
of its organ only) and from the beginning is speculative and
impartial in its own outlook, and thinks it not robbery to
take the point of view of God, of the truth, and of eter-
nity." 2 After all how different is the view stated in this
sentence from the essence of absolutism? I see no signifi-
cant difference whatsoever. And is it not the very soul and
substance of idealism to argue that "this gift of transcend-
ing humanity in sympathy with the truth is a part, and the
most distinctive part, of human nature?" 3 Why talk about
the genteel tradition being at bay when you who claim that
it is at bay assert what you say is its essence? Idealism is
no less excellent when it is called realism.
What's in a name? that which we call a rose,
By any other name would smell as sweet.
The second illustration is Pratt's article in Essays in
Critical Realism, where he first assails idealism, charging
it with an error which is his own, and then states as his own
view the essence of what he assailed. Idealism holds, accord-
ing to Pratt, that the transcendent is a real thing, independ-
ent of and inaccessible to actual thinking. But this is criti-
cal realism's conception of transcendence, and not that of
the idealism which Pratt is criticising. Then to meet this
error in idealism Pratt lists various cases and types of
knowledge that are transcendent and yet are accepted by
everybody. Yet these cases and types are just what idealism
uses to prove its own theory of transcendence. In calling
attention to this way of criticising idealism, Bosanquet
says: "A careful study of Profesor Pratt's argument on
this head (transcendence) reveals a state of mind that is
really . . . amazing, incredible if it were not there in black
and white." *

Tradition at Bay (Scribners, 1931), pp. 33 and 65.
» Ibid.
* Bernard Bosanquet: The Meeting of Extremes in Contemporary Philos-
ophy, p. 144 (Macraillan).
These two illustrations indicate a root defect in realism,
which is, briefly stated, that it attacks idealism from with-
out, and then accepts the basic principles of idealism when
it attempts to be constructive and to develop its own view-
point. Not until realism recognizes how much of idealism
is compatible with the realistic premises will realism become
a sound philosophy. And when it recognizes this, it will
change its method of criticism and controversy, and become
more friendly to the great insights which have been won by
idealists. There is ample evidence that this process is now
taking place in realism, and that the next stage in the de-
velopment of this philosophy will be the attempt to recover
much of the truth which was won for the human mind by
the idealism of the nineteenth century. For instance, Broad
says: "I think it probable that some of the summi phi-
losophi of our time tend to neglect much fine gold which
was mined by Hegel and Kant." And it would certainly take
a high-powered, metaphysical microscope to detect the dif-
ference between the later views of Pratt, Montague, and
some of the other realists, and the essential doctrines of
idealism.
2. Realist versus Realist
In his Carus Lectures, entitled The Revolt Against Dual-
ism (Open Court Publishing Co.), A. O. Lovejoy examines
in detail the contemporary hostility to the two forms of
dualism advocated by the critical realists—epistemological
and psycho-physical dualism. Most of the philosophers crit-
icised by Lovejoy are realists of a monistic persuasion on
both of these issues. He divides the revolt against dualism
into two main phases, an earlier phase, represented by the
new realists in this country and most of the British realists,
and a later phase, represented by Whitehead and others.
Examining the technical arguments of these various phi-
losophers, he reaches the conclusion that both forms of
dualism are substantially sound, and that realistic monism
is in fundamental conflict with common sense, is based upon
REALISM
fallacious scientific concepts, and is logically self-contra-
dictory. Lovejoy's slashing attack on those forms of real-
ism that are opposed to dualism is one of the most
significant movements in up-to-the-minute contemporary
philosophy, since it has already provoked equally spirited
rejoinders from some of those whom it attacked, and is cer-
tain to produce more in the near future. We cannot here
enter into the details of this violent controversy, but it
should be of value to indicate briefly the central point at
issue.
A. E. Murphy, a promising young philosopher represent-
ing the second phase of the revolt, has invented a good label
for the later form of monistic realism. He calls it Objective
Relativism. By this phrase he intends to stress the connec-
tion between realism and the theories of relativity of Ein-
stein. Utilizing the new physics a number of realists, under
the leadership of A. N. Whitehead, have attacked what
they call the "bifurcation of nature" into a subjective and
an objective realm. In Whitehead's famous phrase "nature
is closed to mind," and nature is looked upon as a relativity
process such as the Einstein theory implies that it is. In
other words "an ether of events" is substituted for the
physical ether of the older physics, and this ether of events
is made up of various time-systems which are of such a
nature that measured time in one system differs from meas-
ured time in another system, when both are moving systems.
Lovejoy attacks this reduction of the world of physical
nature to relativity systems. He points out that the term
relativity has three different meanings: (i) conditionality,
or one entity being conditioned or caused by another, (ii)
respectivity, or one entity being in relation to another by
way of, or in respect of, some third entity, and (iii) per-
spectivity, or viewing nature from some one perspective or
standpoint. In view of these three different senses of rela-
tivity Lovejoy thinks physicists and philosophers alike
should abandon the term, and use in each case "one or an-
231
other of the expressions 'caused' or 'conditioned by,' 're-
spective to,' or 'appearing from the standpoint of.' The
present fashion of employing a single term masks the fact
that different sorts of 'relativity' are in question in differ-
ent parts of the theory or in different interpretations of it"
(P. 140.
Following up this attack in two papers entitled The Para-
dox of the Time-Retarding Journey, Lovejoy imagines
twins, named Peter and Paul, being born at a certain date,
at which date Paul begins a journey among the stars and
later returns to his twin brother. The paradox of the twins
results. Lovejoy states this interesting paradox as follows:
"Imagine Peter to be on a flat platform extending as far as
we please in either direction, and Paul to be on a similar
platform immediately adjacent to Peter's and in uniform un-
accelerated motion relative to it and parallel with it. If,
while the two were at rest, synchronized clocks and auto-
matic cameras were placed at intervals along the inner
edges of both platforms, the event of any reading of any
one of Peter's clocks will be simultaneous with the reading
of any clock of Paul's which may be passing, for both clocks
will be in this case virtually in the same place." And then
Lovejoy changes the situation and introduces a further sup-
position "in order to avoid any complication involved in
getting the motion started." "Peter and Paul, not now
brpthers, must be supposed to have been born simultane-
ously at points A and A' when these points on the two
platforms were passing each other, and each remains
throughout at the place of his birth on his own platform.
In both directions from A and A', on both platforms, ob-
servation-posts are placed at wide intervals; at each of
these assistant observers are stationed, duly provided with
clocks originally synchronized. It is the law on each plat-
form that no one can be appointed an assistant observer
unless he was born at the same time as Peter and Paul.
Assume that 70 years have elapsed on Peter's platform
REALISM
up to the moment when he passes observation post P'
on Paul's platform. Given sufficient velocity, he, an old
man of 70 gazing at his coeval, the assistant observer at
P', will seem to that observer to be a young man of 21;
and assuming, as is done in the customary story, that a re-
tardation observed from one system is a physical fact on
the other, Peter will be twenty-one as well as seventy. At
the same time his coeval at P' will appear to Peter to be
21, and will therefore be of that age, as well as of the age
of seventy." 6 This is Lovejoy's idea of the kind of paradox
in which the Einstein theory of relativity involves the ob-
jective relativist.
In a long review of Lovejoy's book McGilvary answers
him from the standpoint of objective relativism. The sub-
stance of this rejoinder is that Lovejoy operates with
Newtonian ideas of time and space, whereas the objective
relativist operates exclusively with Einsteinian concepts.
McGilvary says that "the voice that speaks in Lovejoy's
book is indeed the voice of the twentieth century, but the
hand that writes the book is in many spots suspiciously sug-
gestive of an earlier age." And in his reply to the Paradox
of the Time-Retarding Journey McGilvary goes into detail
to prove that the paradox is wholly due to the author's fail-
ure to understand the Einstein theory and to his insinuating
"into the relativity problem a Newtonian postulate." We
cannot enter into the details of this brilliant rejoinder, but
he who fails to read it, and especially the concluding story
of Peter and Paul, told as McGilvary thinks it should be,
has missed one of the real gems of recent philosophical
literature.
B Philosophical Review, Vol. XL, pp. 6jf. In the same journal and volume
(p. 358f.), McGilvary quotes this passage with certain phrases italicised
to show where he thinks Lovejoy uses ambiguous terms and "points at
which Lovejoy introduces into the problem features that do not appear in it
as it is faced in relativity-physics." McGilvary's review of Lovejoy's Revolt
Against Dualism is in the same volume, pp. 246-265, and the second of
Lovejoy's papers is to be found on p. 152. See also the articles by Lovejoy
and McGilvary in the Journal of Philosophy, Vols. XXVII and XXVIII.
3. Some Pragmatist Objections to Realism
John Dewey has especially criticised Holt's cross-section
theory of consciousness on the ground that it ignores the
meanings that we use all the time but of which we are not
really conscious. The theory takes consciousness "where
there is a minimum of doubt and inquiry" as the standard
form of all consciousness. This neglects reflective thinking
as an element of consciousness. "It [the cross-section
theory] assumes a knowing mind wholly guileless, and ex-
traordinarily competent, whose sole business is to behold
and register objects just as what they are, and which is un-
swervingly devoted to its business." 6 But such a concept
of the knowing mind is really a survival of the theological
conception that "God is perfect mind and man is created
in the image of his maker." Yet Dewey admits that science
gives some justification to the theory of Holt. Nevertheless
the theory holds only for the most gifted and highly in-
tellectual minds. As a description of normal minds it is
highly artificial. Most of the entities making up the content
of a normal consciousness are not real at all but fanciful,
imaginary, and sentimental. Holt's theory makes such en-
tities a part of the realm of being.
Dewey holds that the alleged independence of objects
from active, living mind is due to a false conception of the
act of knowing. Realists have over-emphasized deduction as
a characteristic form of knowing, that is to say, starting
with postulates and deducing their consequences. All active
thinking is inductive. "Knowledge or science, as a work of
art, like any other work of art, confers upon things traits
and potentialities which did not previously belong to them.
Objection from the side of alleged realism to this state-
ment springs from a confusion of tenses. Knowledge is not
a distortion or perversion which confers upon its subject-
6John Dewey: Experience and Nature, p. 309 (Open Court Publishing
Co.).
REALISM
matter traits which do not belong to it," (as realism as-
serts) "but is an act which confers upon non-cognitive ma-
terial traits which did not belong to it" (loco citato, p.
381). So reality continually gets new accretions from the
active cognitive processes that deal with it. The realist's
doctrine of a complete independence of physical events,
qualities, and relations from the act of knowing is falla-
cious. The meanings we give to events in our reflective think-
ing, as we deal with practical situations, are henceforth part
and parcel of those events. No line can be drawn between
what is physically real and what is due to the cognitive act.
C. I. Lewis, in Mind and the World Order, follows
Dewey in this denial that there are such absolutely inde-
pendent objects as the realists claim. He especially objects
to Broad's theory of the sensa. He thinks that it is a super-
ficial theory which does not get down underneath the real
problem. To assume a sense datum which nobody is sen-
sing, or one which is permanent and unaltered in the midst
of the changes of cognitive awareness of it, amounts to
retaining Kant's famous thing-in-itself. This leaves the facts
of experience and plunges us into metaphysics, and substi-
tutes for what we know and cannot doubt entities that
are purely speculative and whose existence is doubtful.
Lewis also attacks the essence theory of the critical
realists. He thinks it is based upon a fundamental assump-
tion that is fallacious. That assumption is that there exists
such a thing as immediate cognitive awareness of such
essences, and that all the rest of human knowledge is some-
how derived from this simple type. While we cannot deny
that there is immediate awareness, nevertheless we err if we
call this knowledge. For no concepts are involved in such
awareness and without concepts, or meaningful symbols,
there can be no knowledge. Hence Lewis prefers to call
"qualia" what the critical realists call essences. Such qualia
are universals, but they are not the properties of objects.
It is a confusion of universals with properties of objects
which vitiates the essence theory of the critical realists.
Qualia are subjective, but properties of objects are objec-
tive.
4. Some Idealist Objections to Realism
In addition to the general criticisms given at the begin-
ning of this chapter let us indicate briefly some other ideal-
ist objections to realistic theories. Hoernle has pointed out
that the realistic metaphysics is not so much untrue and
fallacious as it is inadequate. He writes: "On the whole, the
tendency of Realists is to take man in a biological context,
and to place him, as neither more nor less than an animal
species and a late product of evolution, in an environment
of which the permanent features are drawn by astronomy
and geology, by physics and chemistry. But this context
is not so much untrue as inadequate: it does not give
us the whole truth, as little as does the context of intro-
spective psychology. For, each context imposes its own
characteristic pattern on the facts brought within its
scope: it permits us to use these facts only so far as they
fit into this pattern. It imposes its own distinctive valuation
upon the fact." 7 And he might have added that it excludes
all other valuations of all other contexts.
This criticism even applies to the emergent evolutionist's
theory. Emergent evolution applies to the entire universe
a principle of growth which is properly applicable only to
parts of the universe. The levels theory of reality of ideal-
ism is a much better principle of explanation. As DeWitt
Parker puts it in Contemporary American Philosophy:
"Individual systems rise, flourish and decay, but the uni-
verse 'has no seasons.' . . . The Greek worship of the
stars and Plotinus's notion of emanation represent, I be-
lieve, a truer conception of man's place in the universe than
contemporary naturalism, which places man at the pinnacle
of reality." Leighton, and many other idealists, would
7R. F. A. Hoernl*. Idealism as a Philosophy, p. 257 (R. C. Smith).
REALISM
agree with Parker in substituting the theory that the
levels of reality emanate from God, instead of emerging
from an abstract Space-Time.
Idealists also object to the critical realists' theory of
essences. In making absolutely everything real in a world of
essences, or universals, where one entity has no more mean-
ing than another, and each is eternally what it is, the criti-
cal realists have created a purely abstract and conceptual
world, and have substituted it for the real world as it comes
home to us in our concrete experiences. Hocking says:
"Such an independent realm of universals or 'essences'
appears to me, with all respect, as a piece of modern my-
thology without Plato's excuse, a striking instance of the
extreme fancifulness which marks the irony of the realist's
resolve to be supremely matter-of-fact." But let this doc-
trine of essence be replaced by the idealistic doctrine of the
concrete universal and this abstractness will disappear. A
valueless essence will then become "the principle of indi-
viduality and value."
PRAGMATISM
WHAT PRAGMATISM IS
i. The Words Pragmatic and Pragmatism
THE Greek word irpayna, meaning a thing done or a
fact, the plural of which is vp6.yna.Ta, meaning affairs,
especially state affairs, is the source of the word pragmatic.
In the Critique of Practical Reason Immanuel Kant used
the term to distinguish those rules of art and technique
which are derived from, and which are applicable to, ex-
perience from those which he regarded as prior to or
logically independent of experience. In Kant's technical ter-
minology the latter are called a priori principles. The dis-
tinguished American mathematician and philosopher,
Charles S. Peirce, borrowed the term pragmatic from Kant,
and William James took it from Peirce.
The word pragmatism is formed from the same root by
using the suffix ism instead of ic. George Eliot used this
term in Middlemarch to refer to an officious and imper-
tinent type of character. In history the term pragmatism is
synonymous with the term pragmatic method and refers
to the tracing of the causes and effects of historical events.
There is, however, no evidence of any connection whatever
between these two meanings of the word pragmatism and
its philosophic connotations, which rather go back to the
term pragmatic as used by Kant.
As a matter of fact the word pragmatism has come to
have in philosophy a number of meanings of varying gen-
erality. Underlying these diverse meanings is the general
notion of using the practical consequences of ideas and be-
liefs as norms for determining their validity, truth and
239
PRAGMATISM
value. Thus James, who was admittedly the first to use the
word in print, defined pragmatism as an attitude of mind
which consists primarily "in looking away from first things,
principles, categories, supposed necessities and of looking
toward last things, fruits, consequences, facts." 1 And in
the article in Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psy-
chology, entitled Pragmatism, Peirce refers to it as a
method of clarifying conceptions. He writes: "Consider
what effects, that might conceivably have practical bear-
ings, we conceive the objects of our conceptions to have.
Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our
conception of the object." 2 Peirce later invented the term
pragmaticism to differentiate his conception of pragmatism
from that of James and his followers. In his contribution to
the volume of essays in honor of James, entitled Essays
Philosophical and Psychological, John Dewey defines prag-
matism tentatively as "the doctrine that reality possesses
practical character and that this character is most effica-
ciously expressed in the function of intelligence" (p. 59).
However, Dewey preferred the names instrumentallsm and
experimentalism for the new philosophy. F. C. S. Schiller
defines pragmatism as "the technical name of a tendency
which can be traced throughout the history of philosophy,
but has only of late grown self-conscious, systematic and
general." Pragmatism "relies for its justification on the fact
that everything we think and do has to be willed, and has
ultimately some biological value as a vital adaptation, suc-
cessful or the reverse." 8 Schiller, however, strongly dis-
liked the word pragmatism as a name for the new philoso-
phy, saying that it was almost sufficient to damn any dog

241
that bore it. He pleaded with James to adopt the name
humanism, but without success, although he says that James
later regretted that he did not follow his advice.
2. Peirce's Contribution to Pragmatism
Schiller calls Charles S. Peirce the "putative parent" of
pragmatism, but adds that he was actually driven to deny
his paternity, referring to his adopting the term pragmat-
icism as a better name for his philosophy than pragma-
tism. Schiller and some others hold that William James is
the "real progenitor" of the movement. In an interesting
letter from Mrs. William James to Schiller, she says: "You
are right in what you say of confessing to obligations which
he never owed. . . . When William was a student in the
chemical laboratory and absorbed in philosophy, he found
Charles Peirce a stimulating acquaintance; so when years
after William sought to give a name to the faith he had
long held, he glanced backward and said to himself, 'I must
have owed Pragmatism to Peirce.' " 4 These statements of
Schiller and Mrs. James have to be taken with a grain of
salt. There can be no doubt that Dewey and others are
right in holding that Peirce made an important contribu-
tion to the new philosophy. What was that contribution?
Peirce was primarily a logician especially interested in the
methodological procedure of the laboratory sciences. He
believed that when a prescription for an experiment is
tested out in the laboratory it will produce a definite type of
experience. Consequently he held that a complete definition
of any concept is the totality of the experimental occur-
rences implied in that concept. The rational meaning of
every concept lies in the future and consists "in that process
of evaluation whereby the existent comes more and more to
embody generals." Peirce did not think of this process as
one of achieving a particular or a personal goal. He was
* See my Anthology of Recent Philosophy, p. 458.
PRAGMATISM
interested only in the general or universal meaning of the
concept.
According to Morris R. Cohen, Peirce got this method
of approach to the definition of a concept from Chauncey
Wright, a distinguished Harvard professor who had done
creative work in mathematics and physics, and who also had
a deep interest in philosophy. Cohen quotes a letter from
Peirce in which he says that the doctrine of pragmatism
first saw the light in a "Metaphysical Club" which he or-
ganized at Harvard and of which Wright was the ablest
member. James was also a member of this club. Peirce and
Wright were in the habit of disputing and conversing to-
gether two or three hours daily, keeping this up for several
years. Peirce's idea that the laboratory scientist translates
general ideas into prescriptions for reaching new truths by
experimentation came from Wright. The basic principle of
Peirce's pragmatism is that the meaning of ideas is best
discovered by putting them to an experimental test and by
observing the consequences which result from such a test.3
3. William James's Contribution to Pragmatism
M. C. Otto has rightly pointed out that William James's
essay, entitled Remarks on Spencer's Definition of Mind
as Correspondence, which was published in The Journal of
Speculative Philosophy in the same month and year as
Peirce's essay on How to Make our Ideas Clear (January
1878), contains in germ many of the pragmatic ideas which
James developed later. Among other things the essay em-
phasizes the active side of human intelligence, and especially
stresses ideals and human preferences as genuine parts of
experience. Otto refers to this essay as a second source of
pragmatism and attempts to prove by the intimate and mo-
mentous personal experience which generated it, that for
James the new philosophy was a moral and religious doc-

parts of which are reprinted in my Anthology of Recent Philosophy.
243
trine much more than a logical one. Others have stressed
this fundamental difference in interest between James and
Peirce. Undoubtedly it is an essential difference but it must
not blind us to the fact that there were two other important
logical and psychological differences between these two great
founders of Pragmatism.8
(i) James was a nominalist in logic whereas Peirce
thought that universal concepts express a common mean-
ing and are more than mere names, having an independent
logical status.7 (ii) In psychology James was a sensation-
alist, believing especially in stressing particular sense
data, whereas Peirce had little interest in psychology and
especially emphasized logical and intellectual concepts. In
other words, Peirce was much more rationalistic and more
influenced by the Kantian tradition, whereas James was
much more empirical and more influenced by the Brit-
ish tradition. It is not without significance that James
dedicated his Pragmatism to John Stuart Mill. Hence,
when he took up the principle of pragmatism he shifted it
away from experimental tests of universal concepts and he
also extended the notion of practical consequences in a way
which Peirce did not approve. As Dewey points out, James's
use of the principle "destroyed the importance attached by
Peirce to the greatest possible application of the rule, or
habit of conduct—its extension to universality." For James
stressed the concrete, particular consequences of beliefs, re-
gardless of whether these consequences result from labora-
tory tests. He would use any kind of consequences in every-
day life as a test of the truth or falsity of a belief. James
writes: "I should prefer to express Peirce's principle by
saying that the effective meaning of any philosophic propo-
sition can always be brought down to some particular con-
sequence, in our future practical experience, whether active

PRAGMATISM
or passive; the point lying rather in the fact that the ex-
perience must be particular, than in the fact that it must be
active." 8 It was this shift which James made in Peirce's
244
and to adopt the name pragmaticism for his own theory.
Yet it was just this shift which enabled James to extend
and to popularize pragmatism. He applied it to various
types of beliefs. An especially popular application of it was
to religious beliefs. His well-known essay entitled The Will
to Believe is not altogether unlike Pascal's famous religious
wager.9 According to James the belief in God is a live
option. Those who accept it as true find that it works by
making them morally better and more optimistic. Those
who reject it find that pessimism and despair overwhelm
them. In practical, everyday life it is more useful to believe
than not to believe. Therefore this basic religious belief is
true. Its truth is constituted by its practical value. In Prag-
matism James applied the pragmatic method to a number
of thorny and traditional metaphysical problems, such as
the problem of the one and the many, the nature of the
Aristotelian categories, free-will versus determinism, de-
sign, et cetera. He also developed his doctrine of meliorism,
that salvation is neither necessary nor impossible but may
come to those who do what they can to make a better world.
Thus James popularized pragmatism and applied it to the
common-sense beliefs of mankind, as well as to strictly
philosophical problems.
4. F. C. S. Schiller's Contribution to Pragmatism
As he himself admits, F. C. S. Schiller owes his concep-
tion of pragmatism primarily to James. He is a devoted
disciple of James, regarding him as one of the two su-
premely great men he has known personally, the other being

of Recent Philosophy, p. 435. Italics mine.

Lord Balfour. Schiller came to this country from England
and studied philosophy at Cornell University, where the in-
fluence of Absolute Idealism completely dominated. While
at Cornell he discovered James, and to him the discovery
was like that of a weary and thirsty traveler in the desert
coming upon an oasis. As a result he has spent a life time in-
terpreting and expounding James's form of pragmatism.
However, as has already been mentioned, he prefers to call
it humanism.
Throughout his writings, Schiller has stressed the way in
which all human beliefs and institutions, yes and even reality *
itself, are created by the activity of the human will. Human
feelings, aspirations, and desires—in a word, the human will
to live—is the ultimate fact which must furnish the explana-
tion for all other facts. Human purpose is the primary
reality. All truth is man-made and dependent upon human
purpose. All reality is continually in the making and the
force that is creating it is the human will. Schiller identi-
fies philosophy with the process of evolution and seeks the
goal of all evolution, cosmic and cultural alike, in a com-
munal organism of perfected personalities. But although he
has vigorously defended pragmatism for many years in the
University of Oxford, England, and has written and lec-
tured extensively, it can hardly be said that Schiller has
succeeded in developing a significant pragmatist school in
England. Idealism and Realism are the dominant types of
philosophy there.
Dewey's statement of the difference between his own type
of pragmatism and that of the humanists, among whom
Schiller is a leading representative, is of the utmost impor-
tance to an understanding of pragmatism. He writes: "A
synthetic pragmatism such as Mr. James has ventured upon
will take a very different form according as the point of
view of what he calls the 'Chicago School' or that of hu-
manism is taken as a basis for interpreting the nature of the
'personal'. According to the latter view, the personal ap-
pears to be ultimate and unanalyzable, the metaphysically
real. Associations with idealism, moreover, give it an ideal-
istic turn, a translation, in effect, of monistic intellectualistic
idealism into, pluralistic, voluntaristic idealism. But, accord-
ing to the former, the personal is not ultimate, but is to be
analyzed and defined biologically on its genetic side, ethi-
cally on its prospective and functioning side." 10 Enlight-
ened by this distinction let us turn to a consideration of
Dewey's own contribution to pragmatism.
5. John Dewey's Instrumentalism
John Dewey is today generally recognized as the most
distinguished living pragmatist philosopher. He and his col-
leagues, especially George H. Mead, James H. Tufts, and
A. W. Moore, formed a strong pragmatic centre at the
University of Chicago. When he moved to Columbia Uni-
versity Dewey created a strong pragmatist following there.
In these two graduate schools many teachers of philosophy
in American colleges and universities received their train-
ing. Will Durant and James Harvey Robinson both came
under Dewey's influence at Columbia. An influential teacher
and a profound thinker, Dewey has recently been the re-
cipient of high honors. He has given special lectures in
China and Japan, was first lecturer on the Carus Foundation
in this country, gave a series of lectures on the Gifford
Foundation in Scotland, was granted an honorary degree
at the Sorbonne in November of 1930, and he is now
(I93I"32) special William James lecturer at Harvard Uni-
versity. Dewey's philosophy of education has revolutionized
the public schools of this and other countries. He has also
had a tremendous influence in creating a new liberalism in
the political and social philosophy of America. It is signifi-
cant that he has been seriously considered as a third party
candidate for president. Dewey certainly stands today sec-
ond to none among contemporary American philosophers.

He has a very large following among educators, philoso-
phers, and the intelligentsia generally. For over a third of
a century Dewey has vigorously defended pragmatism.
We shall have much to say about Dewey's philosophy in
succeeding chapters, since he has written on practically all
of the great problems of philosophy. It will suffice here to
explain briefly what he means by instrumentalism, which
is his technical name for the philosophy of pragmatism.
In addition to the experimental method of verification
stressed by Peirce and the popular version of pragmatism
given by James, Dewey stresses two other factors as being
especially important. One of these is psychological and the
other is logical. The biological drift of modern psychology,
the interest in behavior and in a study of the continuity of
behavior in animals and men, is a movement which has coin-
cided with and greatly influenced the development of prag-
matism. In fact, Dewey calls himself a behaviorist in psy-
chology. As early as 1903, in Studies in Logical Theory, this
aspect of the new philosophy was stressed. Dewey espe-
cially emphasized it in his Influence of Darwin on Phi-
losophy. Thus pragmatism has absorbed a good deal of the
evolutionism of the nineteenth century.
This new movement in psychology was really initiated by
James when he replaced the ideas, sensations, and images of
the traditional psychology with the notion of a stream of
consciousness which is continuous. Moreover James laid
down the criterion that mind is an instrument for realizing
purposes, all ideas being regarded by him as "purely tele-
ological weapons of the mind." All of this is to be found
in James's Psychology, which both Dewey and Schiller think
is more of a source of pragmatism than James's book of
that title.
Yet instrumentalism is certainly not wholly due to James,
and Dewey undoubtedly minimizes the significance of his
own contribution to it. It was he who first stressed the
biological function of thinking, treating mind as an instru-
PRAGMATISM
ment for establishing control over the environment. By so
doing he, more than any other pragmatist, has developed
the distinctive logical theory of the movement. Caldwell is
unquestionably right in saying: "It is through his
(Dewey's) influence generally that pragmatists seem always
to be talking about the way in which 'we arrive at' our
beliefs, about ideas as 'instruments' for the interpretation
and arrangement of our experience, about the 'passage'
from cognitive expectation to 'fulfilment,' about ideas as
'plans of action' and 'mental habits,' about the growth and
utility of truth, about the 'instrumental' character of all our
thinking, about beliefs as more fundamental than knowl-
edge, and so on." 11
Otto calls attention to a paper by Dewey, written in
1888, in which he laid down a cardinal principle of instru-
mentalism, even though he was at that time an avowed neo-
Kantian. This principle was a defense and an interpretation
of democracy, and it has gradually been expanded until
today it is one of the major tenets of pragmatism. In
Otto's words: "One cannot read the writings of instru-
mentalists without sensing the depth of their democratic
convictions. They think of Pragmatism as the philosophic
counterpart of the democratic movement in modern so-
ciety, and it would not be wrong to say that for most of
them Democracy is Religion." 12 Now there can be no doubt
that Otto is right in making this idea central in in-
strumentalism and in giving Dewey credit for contributing
to it. But James also contributed to this part of pragmatism,
especially in his doctrine of meliorism. Moreover, the pe-
culiar expansion of this idea represents a shift in the origi-
nal teaching of pragmatism, which is due more to later
writings than to Dewey's and James's earlier works. Before
the World War, pragmatism was much less a democratic

ideal which served as a substitute for religion. It was really
the experiences of the World War which made it more of
a social philosophy than a logical and metaphysical theory.
Dewey, Mead, Moore, Otto, Ames, Bode, Tufts, T. V.
Smith, and H. M. Kallen have been responsible for this
shift, and, although its germs were latent in the pre-war
writings of pragmatists, the significant development of it
has come since the war. It is a part of the general drift
towards socialism which has characterized post-war condi-

ency. The former goes back to Peirce for his basic prin-
ciples and the latter to James.
In conclusion a word should be added about George H.
Mead's contribution to instrumentalism. Although he pub-
lished little while he lived and died before his Carus Lec-
tures were revised for publication, he has long been recog-
nized as one of the profoundest thinkers this movement of
thought has produced. In his oration at Mead's funeral
Dewey said: "His mind was germinative and seminal. One
would have to go far to find a teacher of our own day who
started in others so many fruitful lines of thought; I dis-
like to think what my own thinking might have been were
it not for the seminal ideas which I derived from him. For
his ideas were always genuinely original; they started one
thinking in directions where it had never occurred to one
that it was worth while even to look." 18

THE METHODS OF PRAGMATISM
i. The Genetic Method
ONE of the basic methods of reasoning of the prag-
matists is the genetic method. Generally speaking,
this refers to the tracing of the evolution of any entity
whatever from its original to its most complicated and
most highly developed form. We may trace the unfolding
of mental from bodily functions, showing how mind is
dependent upon complexity of physical and neurological
organization. Or we may trace the unfolding of social life
from lower forms of mentality, where intercommunication
is barely possible, up to its highest development in modern
civilized nations, where language and other means of com-
munication are smoothly functioning. Whenever we seek
the origin, and trace the evolution from lower to higher
forms of any phenomenon whatever, we are using the
genetic method.
More specifically the genetic method in philosophy means
the throwing of light on philosophical problems and beliefs
by tracing them back to the concrete and practical situation
in which they arose. Locating them in their concrete setting
we may hope to find the social pattern of the general
social order in which such beliefs were vital, and we may
also discover the genetic forces which were at work to gen-
erate them. No philosophical theory can be understood
when taken in complete isolation from the general culture
in which it originally grew. The cultural ideas which were
especially dominant at the time the theory was developed
are the underlying forces working to produce the theory.
250
The individual philosopher who is supposed to have origi-
nated a given theory was really only an instrument of these
social and cultural forces. Having traced a theory back to
its social context we see that it was really an instrument by
which the various conflicting ideas of the time were brought
into some kind of harmonious adjustment. Hence prag-
matist discussions of the history of philosophy especially
stress the social and cultural background of the different'
systems of philosophy. The pragmatist regards a bare ex-
position of a philosopher's theories as entirely inadequate.
We must turn our attention away from specific opinions of
individual philosophers, and treat philosophy as essentially
a product of vital needs and essential conflicts within the en-
tire social order.
In Pragmatism James describes the process by which men
settle into new opinions. The individual gets a new idea
and then discovers that it is in conflict with his old ideas. *
He then adjusts the new idea with his old beliefs, in such
a way as to conserve as many of his old beliefs as possible
without abandoning the new idea. In this way he fits the
new doctrine into his old beliefs with a minimum loss of
the old. Now, says James, just as truth grows in the mind
of an individual thinker, so knowledge as a whole, or
viewed socially, is a continual marriage of new ideas with
old beliefs and customs. Culture advances slowly by this
perpetual process. And James argues that the genetic
method of pragmatism is simply a generalization of this
process by which knowledge grows in individuals and in the
social mind of humanity as a whole. He writes: "Messers
Dewey, Schiller and their allies, in reaching this general
conception of all truth, have only followed the example of
geologists, biologists and philologists. In the establishment
of these other sciences, the successful stroke was always to
take some simple process actually observable in operation—
as denudation by weather, say, or variation from parental
type, or change of dialect by incorporation of new words
PRAGMATISM
and pronunciations—and then to generalize it, making it
apply to all times, and produce great results by summating
its effects through the ages." 1 James later calls this a
genetic theory of what is meant by truth.
Let us briefly summarize the kinds of entities to which
this genetic method has been applied by pragmatists: (i)
As early as 1898 James applied this method to philosophic
controversies, showing that they are mere speculations until
they are tied down to some definite situation which will give
them meaning. (ii) James commends Peirce for having
applied the genetic method to objects, when he held that the
meaning of an object is to be found in the practical effects
it may be expected to have in a given situation. (iii)
James and others have applied the method to ideas, show-
ing how they are the genesis of certain consequences which
they intend. (iv) Pragmatists have also applied this
method to beliefs of all kinds—religious, metaphysical,
aesthetic and scientific. What is the origin of human beliefs
and what actual consequences and alterations in social con-
ditions have they produced? These constitute their meaning.
Thus the genetic method of pragmatism is capable of a
wide application, and Dewey holds that James was quite
right in thinking that the beginning of the use of this
method by philosophers means that "the center of gravity
of philosophy must alter its place. ... It will be an altera-
tion in the seat of authority that reminds one almost of
the Protestant Reformation." 2
We may agree with James and Dewey that the genetic
method is of real value. Pragmatists certainly deserve great
credit for having perfected it. Nevertheless it creates a
kind of a paradox for a pragmatist. The essence of pragma-
tism is its look towards the future. Thought is always sup-
posed to look away from the past and towards a better
'-William James: Pragmatism, pp. $if. (Longmans). See my exposition
of the genetic method in The God of the Liberal Christian, Chap. II
(Appleton).
2 Loco citato, p. 123.
state of affairs which is to be developed. But the genetic
method points pragmatists back to beginnings. Hence it
points in the opposite direction from that in which the
pragmatist wishes to go. Moreover, the ideal of going
back to the beginnings of beliefs is difficult to realize pre-
cisely with respect to the most fundamental of human be-
liefs, since many of them began before recorded history.
Thus the pragmatist advocates a method which is often
impractical, and which turns thought in the reverse direc-
tion from that in which he is really most interested in going.
And he soon discovers that the genetic method is sometimes
in fundamental opposition to the treatment of ideas as in-
struments by which future adjustments are made. Ames
and other pragmatists have made effective use of the
genetic method in explaining the origin and development of
religious ideas and customs, and Dewey and James were
much influenced by this method at the beginning of the
pragmatist movement. But in his recent writings Dewey has
come out strongly against the basic assumption of the
genetic method that complex social phenomena of the pres-
ent-day can best be understood by going back to the simpler
social contexts out of which they presumably emerged. He
now recognizes that philosophy must take its data from
the world as it is today, instead of trying to get back to a
simpler condition of affairs which will explain existing com-
plicated conditions.3
Hence it would be a serious mistake to treat the genetic
method as the only method of pragmatism, or even as the
most important. It has certainly been and still is of con-
siderable influence in pragmatist reasoning. Pragmatists
working in the fields of philosophy of religion, history of
philosophy, and ethics make effective use of it. In fact one
of the best examples of its use is to be found in Part I of
Dewey and Tufts's Ethics, where the evolution of morality
3 See the quotation from Dewey below, p. 268.
PRAGMATISM
is traced through three stages.4 Nevertheless this method is
unquestionably gradually being superseded by other prag-
matist methods.
2. The Denotative Method
In his Carus lectures, published under the title Experi-
ence and Nature (Open Court), John Dewey devotes a
chapter to the exposition of a method of philosophizing
which he calls the denotative method. By this he means
something very much like the method of intensive concre-
tion expounded above as the basic method of idealism.
Dewey makes a valuable distinction between approaching
the goal of philosophy from the ordinary man's crude and
gross experiences, trying to understand the world which
generated these experiences, and approaching that goal
from the refined concepts of scientists, working back from
them to the original data. While each of these approaches
is valuable, yet each has its peculiar limitations and dan-
gers. Science quickly becomes out-moded and philosophers
who make science the basis of their philosophy get lost
in by-paths. The scientific philosophy of today is anti-
quated tomorrow. Scientific philosophers are too often led
to interpretations of reality which so contradict the ordi-
nary experiences of everyday life as utterly to condemn
their philosophies. On the other hand, ordinary common-
sense of everyday experience is so rich and so complicated,
and past interpretations of it by previous philosophers are
so intermingled with it that the philosopher who uses this
approach almost invariably ends by following some one or
some mixture of the traditional views. Consequently such
philosophers are merely eclectics and syncretists and they
utterly fail to produce any genuinely valid philosophy for .
4 See the defense of the genetic method on pages 3 ff. Cf. Dewey's criticism
of Spencer's use of the comparative method in the Psychological Revttv,
Vol. IX, pp. 2178., where he defends the genetic method against the com-
parative method as used by Spencer. See also James H. Tufts's article on
the "Genesis of the Aesthetic Categories" in the Decennial Publications of
the University of Chicago, Vol. Ill, for another application of this method.
their own day and generation. Dewey thinks that we need
to take an intermediate position, but it must be admitted
that his own method is nearer to the latter than to the for-
mer approach.
For he holds that experience should include "something
at least as wide and deep and full as all history on this
earth, a history which, since history does not occur in the
void, includes the earth and the physical relatives of men.
. . . History denotes both objective conditions, forces,
events and also the human record and estimate of these
events." And a little further on he says: "The whole wide
universe of fact and dream, of event, act, desire, fancy
and meanings, valid or invalid, can be set in contrast to
nothing. And if what has been said is taken literally, 'ex-
perience* denotes just this wide universe." 5 In other words,
the true starting point for the philosopher is 'experience';
nothing stands outside experience but, on the contrary,
everything is included within it.
According to Dewey the radical defect in all other phi-
losophies is that they are based on some selection or other
from experience, instead of being based upon experience
as a whole. He calls his method the denotative method be-
cause it means "seeing what is pointed to and accepting
what is found in good faith and without discount." The
true conception of reality can only be reached by including
all of every conceivable content of experience and by giv-
ing to each item its full and complete rights. "We must not
start with arbitrarily selected simples, and from them de-
duce the complex and varied, assigning what cannot be
thus reduced to an inferior realm of being. It [the notion
of experience] warns us that the tangled and complex is
what we primarily find; that we work from and within it
to discriminate, reduce, analyze, and that we must keep
track of these activities, pointing to them, as well as to
the things upon which they are exercised, and to their re-
5 Loco citato, pp. 8 and 9.
fined conclusions" (p. 13). Thus the true understanding of
reality comes from an insight into the intricate complexi-
ties of life and things, and includes the intellectual processes
by which that insight is reached as part and parcel of that
complexity. Any reality is, therefore, a highly complicated
entity, which contains within itself the processes by which
it is comprehended or understood. So much for Dewey's
denotative method, which, it should again be emphasized, is
strikingly like idealism's method of intensive concretion.
Although Dewey never uses the expression "concrete uni-
versal," he was originally under the influence of Hegel,
and, so far as I know, he has never definitely rejected the
theory of the concrete universal. And how else can the
entity reached by the denotative method be defined than as
a concrete universal? That concept seems to be central in
the last sentence quoted above.
3. The Reflective Method
The most recent statement of pragmatist method, and
one of the most suggestive and interesting, is that given by
C. I. Lewis in Mind and the World Order (Scribners). He
calls himself a "conceptualistic pragmatist," saying that he
is especially indebted to Peirce, but also to James and
Dewey. The term conceptualistic is from the term con-
ceptualism, which was one of the three highly important
theories of universal ideas developed by the scholastic phi-
losophers of the Middle Ages. Realism, taking its cue from
Plato's theory of ideas, held that such universals are arche-
types or patterns or models, and as such they must be much
more real than the particulars which copy them. For ex-
ample, a kind name such as elephant must be far more real
than any particular elephant. Nominalism, on the other
hand, held that all universal ideas are mere names or words
and have no reality whatsoever. Particulars alone are real.
Having no local habitation, elephant in general is merely
a name. Jumbo and other particular elephants alone are
real. Conceptualism took an intermediate position and
argued that universal ideas are concepts which are essential
to thought but which have no reality independently of our
human thought-systems. This is essentially Lewis's attitude
towards the basic concepts or categories of human thinking.
How far he goes in this direction is clearly shown by this
statement in his Preface: "It is not too much to say, I
think, that it becomes a matter of doubt whether the struc-
ture science builds is solidly based upon the earth, or is a
mansion in some Platonic heaven, or is only a kind of castle
in the air."
With regard to the distinction between gross or macro-
scopic and refined or microscopic experience, Lewis is in-
clined to stress the latter type as more important than the
former, thus differing from Dewey, but he uses the term
experience to mean the rationalized data after thought has
done its work. He calls his method the reflective method to
emphasize the overwhelming significance of the work of
thought in experience. Thought can never be separated
from the data it reconstructs, yet it is genuinely a priori,
that is to say, prior to the particular sense data which it
interprets. Lewis claims that his idea of a priori is original
and unique and the essence of the reflective method. Let us
illustrate what he means.
For example, "Physical things must have mass," is an
a priori principle. Using this proposition as a criterion we
can distinguish a pin from the mirror-image of a pin and
from an illusion. Hence no particular datum of any kind
could invalidate the principle. For such a particular datum
would always be referred to some other category, such as
image or illusion, instead of to the category of the physical.
Consequently we may regard the truth of the principle as
prior to and independent of every particular datum. Yet
this would not justify us in treating the a priori principle
as valid outside of our world of human experience. It fol-
lows that the content of experience can never interpret or
PRAGMATISM
categorize itself. The mind always brings to experience all
of the criteria used in making its interpretations. These
criteria are pragmatically useful as guides to action and
they make experience intelligible.
Lewis says that the reflective method has four essential
characteristics: (i) It is dialectical in the Socratic but not
in the Hegelian sense. By this he means that it makes the
Socratic assumption that the mind already possesses truth
implicitly, and that this truth needs only to be elicited and
to be clearly expressed. Moreover some kind of agreement
or accord between minds must be assumed. This accord is
due to "the combined result of the similarity of human
animals, and of their primal interests, and the similarities of
the experience with which they have to deal" (p. 20). (ii)
The reflective method is pragmatic or instrumental. All of
our a priori principles of reasoning or categories are guides
to action and they reflect human nature as well as the gen-
eral character of reality. In fact the human mind is so thor-
oughly social that the social process may be said to have
created the categories as guides to action, (iii) The re-
flective method is empirical. This means that philosophy is
especially concerned "with that part or aspect of experience
which the mind contributes by its attitude of interpreta-
tion." It should be noted that this is not the usual sense of
the word empirical in philosophy. Ordinarily the word re-
fers to that which comes to us through the senses, (iv) The
reflective method is analytic. Philosophic reflection must
analyze out of experience what is already there, and it
should never concern itself with transcendent objects of
thought. Lewis expressly states that the concrete universal
is a myth. Reflection is an extension of the critical attitude
by which we free our own constructions and interpretations
from inconsistency and make them more useful. How we
can free them from inconsistency without catching them
up in a larger whole or concrete universal Lewis does not
make clear.
4. Some General Characteristics of Pragmatism Implicit in
These Methods
All of these methods bring to light certain basic ideas
that are especially characteristic of pragmatism. The word
experience, as used by both Dewey and Lewis, is the key-
word of this philosophy. It can be truthfully said that any-
one who reaches a real understanding of what pragmatists
mean by this word will have a fairly complete knowledge of
pragmatism. It is a general term into which they have
poured all the meaning of their philosophy. And it can also
be said that no non-pragmatist would ever think of using
the word experience to mean what a pragmatist means by
it. For the pragmatist experience is the all-inclusive reality
outside of which there is and can be nothing whatsoever.
Yet this whole is human and social. This peculiar use of the
word experience is the most characteristic feature of prag-
matism. But if the concrete universal of the idealists is a
myth, as Lewis asserts, is not the experience of the prag-
matist just as much one? Philosophers are quite likely to
think that the basic concepts of opposing schools are myths,
because they empty the meaning of them into their own
basic concepts first and then, being unable to find any mean-
ing left in them, they declare them to be myths.
In the prefatory note to the cooperative volume entitled
Creative Intelligence, issued by a group of pragmatists, ap-
pears the following statement: "The significant points of
agreement have to do with the ideas of the genuineness of
the future, of intelligence as the organ for determining the
quality of that future so far as it can come within human
control, and of a courageously inventive individual as the
bearer of a creatively employed mind." Creatively em-
ployed mind, as used here, is social and creative intelligence
is social. Individuals are merely the bearers of this social
mind. Thus the whole social philosophy, mentioned above
PRAGMATISM
as a special post-war development of pragmatism, can
easily be read back into the pragmatist term experience.
The genuineness of the future is an absolutely funda-
mental doctrine of pragmatism. Experience is a temporal
process moving forward or upward. It equals creative mind
and creative intelligence. Yet there is no goal outside of ex-
perience towards which it is moving. And the future is of
interest to man only so far as it, too, is within experience.
Moreover, experience carries the past with it. In fact, by
the workings of intelligence within experience the past is
always so married to the future as to make progress end-
less. The paradoxical motto of the pragmatist is: "The end
is progress."
PRAGMATIST SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEM OF
KNOWLEDGE AND EXISTENCE
i. The General Problem of Knowledge and Existence
PRAGMATISTS hold that knowledge and existence
are not identical but that the distinction between them
falls within experience. The problem is to explain how
knowledge is related to existence within the larger whole of
experience. Unstableness and irregularity characterize the
events which make up existence. We see this especially
among primitive conditions of life where all sorts of dan-
gers such as plague, famine, disease, defeat in battle, death,
et cetera, as well as abundance, strength, victory, festival,
and song are always very near to man. These things are
sporadic and episodic and they make human existence pre-
carious. Now it must be especially emphasized that this as-
pect of existence is a primary datum for modern civilized
man, just as much as it is for savages or was for primitive
man. The nature of the world of existence in which man
finds himself is a partly uncontrollable mixture of both
good and evil events. It is an unfinished and a potential
world in which nothing stays put and in which change is
universal. Now it is just this mixture of instability and
novelty in the world which generates the love of knowledge
or wisdom which is philosophy.
Existence is thus problematic in every one of the actual
and concrete situations which make it up. Reflective thinking
or knowing is the process within experience which trans-
forms this problematic situation—its confusion, its ambi-
guity, and its instability—into a reconstructed situation of
261
PRAGMATISM
assured and definite and durable character. An analogy,
borrowed from Dewey, may make this clearer. Natural
material such as iron ore is transformed into finished steel
by the use of other natural materials such as fire and foun-
dry tools. Now the iron ore is analogous to the problematic
situation and the fire and foundry tools used in melting and
refining the iron ore are analogous to the reflective think-
ing. And the finished steel is analogous to the assured and
durable character of reality which follows the reflecting
upon a problematic situation. Thinking or knowing may,
therefore, be defined as "a continuous process of temporal
reorganization within one and the same world of experi-
enced things" (Dewey). Thus reflection has the same char-
acter of change and instability as the events which make up
existence. Indeed every cognitive process is an event hav-
ing existence. So we may say that every existence is an
event and that every cognitive process is an event.
Dewey uses the illustration of the discovery of America
to make the relation between existence and knowledge
clearer. It is a well-known fact that the Norsemen entered
the Charles River and landed on its banks just west of
Boston, centuries before Columbus landed on the island of
San Salvador. Columbus and the Norsemen both dealt with
essentially the same world of existence—a new continent.
Yet the Norsemen did not use the newly discovered fact to
modify their old beliefs and consequently the old map of
the world was left just as it was. No process of reflective
thinking was generated by their contact with the new fact.
And since no transformation resulted from their landing on
the shores of this continent they made no genuine discovery.
Columbus's coming was entirely different. He changed the
world and the map of the world when he established a
contact with the new continent's outlying islands. He was
led by the fact or problematic situation to a genuine reflec-
tion which transformed the science of geography. Conse-
quently Columbus made the real discovery of America. Now
it is important to stress the fact that this changed the world
of existence itself. That world was enlarged, new fields of
adventure were opened, new lands were cleared, new homes
were built, new nations and cultures were generated by this
one discovery. And every real discovery made by human
thought transforms existence in much the same way. Within
the world of experience a problematic situation is seized
upon by some act of reflective thinking which transforms the ,
total situation into a known object. It is thus that knowledge
and existence are related.
2. The Pragmatist Analysis of Knowledge
Let us now attempt a more detailed analysis of knowl-
edge, as the pragmatist thinks of it. We have learned from
the above discussion that there are two factors or aspects
of knowledge—the given, or what are sometimes called
the data of knowledge, and the interpretative element,
which is constituted by the significant principles by which
the data are ordered, or, to use the technical expression,
categorized. For the basic principles of organization of
knowledge are usually known as categories.
A. The Given.—The immediate data of the senses form
the given. It is always something that thinking does not
create, nor can thinking entirely displace or completely alter
it. In other words the given comes to us from a region that
is beyond our control. For example, a child, a savage and
a civilized adult would each react to an object in an en-
tirely different way. Yet the given in the experience of
each is qualitatively the same and remains constant when
the thinker's interest alters or shifts. To get at what the
given is we must use the criteria of unalterability and
sensuous feeling or quality. The given is really ineffable, un-
knowable.
Yet it would be a mistake to reduce the given to just
what is immediately present to a mind when it thinks.
Rather it includes all of the world of things. To put it dif-
PRAGMATISM
ferently, data are not mere patches of color but trees and
houses and such-like objects of sense. Consequently the
given has to be included within experience and is not to be
thought of as before or as prior to experience. And we
must also be on our guard against taking the term sense
datum in a purely neurological sense. When these qualifica-
tions are taken into account the given turns out to be "a
specious present, fading into the past and growing into the
future with no real boundaries." This does not mean that
it is a smooth and even flux, for it contains the disjunc-
tions, conjunctions and other diverse factors which our
attentiveness makes explicit and definite.
For practical purposes we may ignore the integral and
continuous character of the given, and think of each given
as a separate object, although this is, strictly speaking, an
abstraction. When taken in this sense each given is a pres-
entation or a unique event. But while the given is, in every
case, a unique event, the part of it which might recur is not
to be included as part of the given.
What, then, is the given? Here is an ultimate category
or pragmatist theory of knowledge which is difficult to de-
fine. Taken in the large it is the whole flux of brute factual
occurrences just as they occur. Taken in separate units a
given is a single event without its durable content. But in
both senses the given is an abstraction within experience and
never really exists in complete isolation from all conceptual
or interpretative elements. All that we can say is that "cer-
tain items or aspects of the content of experience satisfy
the criteria of givenness. These are, first, its specific
sensuous or feeling-character, and second, that the mode of
thought can neither create nor alter it—that it remains un-
affected by any change of mental attitude or interest." 1
Let us put what Mead says over against this statement
of Lewis. "[We] cannot maintain that we ever succeed in
isolating data which must remain the same in the kaleido-
1 C. I. Lewis: Mind and the World Order (Scribners), p. 66.
scope of our research science. ... So little can a consist-
ent line of cleavage between facts and ideas be indicated
that we can never tell where in our world of observation the
problem of science will arise, or what will be regarded as
structure of reality and what erroneous idea." 2 So there is
a difference of opinion among pragmatists on the ultimate
nature of the given. What Lewis asserts Mead denies. How-
ever, all pragmatists agree that there is an element in
knowledge which does not come from the mind. This ele-
ment they call the given or the datum of knowledge. Mead,
Dewey and others assert that there is a change in the form
of the data whereas Lewis holds that data are unalterable.
Mead denies that there are any criteria to distinguish the
given from the ideas used to interpret it, whereas Lewis
holds that there are two such criteria. These differences are
significant in that they show a lack of unanimity among
avowed pragmatists on a fundamental issue. However, this
is not to be taken as unfavorable criticism, since such differ-
ences are inevitable in a philosophy that is in the making.
B. The Concept as the Interpretative Element in Knowl-
edge.—Every given takes on meaning. What is meaning? It
is embodied in concepts. What are concepts? The answer
to this question gives us the interpretative element in
knowledge.
Let us rule out all individual differences of perception
and imagery and treat the concept as being that which is
identical in two or more minds when they understand each
other. It is obvious that different people's impressions of
weight, for example, are not identical. Consequently the
concept cannot be a single sense datum. The two criteria
of concepts are that they should express a common or
shared meaning and that each person using the concept
should mean the same thing by it. So defined the concept
is an abstraction. It is the common or shared meaning and
2 Quoted from my Anthology of Recent Philosophy, p. 473. The selection
is from Creative Intelligence,
PRAGMATISM
it is constituted by a pattern of relations. Yet this pattern
of relations which is identical for many minds is always
fused with unique individual feelings, and the separation
of the shared meaning from this concrete content makes it
an abstraction. All of the terms that we use in ordinary
life, indeed, every term in the language of cultured people
has two distinct meanings that are grafted on to the given.
One of these is constituted by the unique feelings, essen-
tially non-sharable, which the given generates in the pri-
vate experience of some percipient being, and the other
meaning is constituted by the sharable conceptual rela-
tions. All meaning is relational, but it may be either the
pattern of relations shared by many m nds or the pattern
of relations peculiar to one mind.
Now why do we form concepts? Why is there an inter-
pretation of the given by shared meanings? It is for be-
havior, conduct, activity. Here is the basic assumption of
pragmatism. "The significance of common conception is for
community of action. . . . Both our common concepts and
our common reality are in part a social achievement,
directed by the community of needs and interests and fos-
tered in the interest of cooperation. Even our categories
may be, to a degree, such social products; and, so far as
the dichotomy of subjective and objective is governed by
consideration of community, reality itself reflects criteria
which are social in nature." 8
3. Some Pragmatist Categories
The most general and basic of the concepts we use in
organizing our experience are known as categories. In
Pragmatism James devotes a chapter to a consideration
of our common-sense categories, such as thing, identity and
difference, kinds, minds, bodies, one time, one space, sub-
ject and attribute, causality, and the fancied or possible
and the real. In addition to these age-old, common-sense
8 C. I. Lewis, loco citato, pp. 90 and 116.
categories there are special scientific categories which have
been developed since 1600 by scientific research. Examples
of these are proton and electron, relativity, and ether.
Moreover, every system of philosophy tends to develop a
set of special categories. Thus the pragmatist term expe-
rience is such a philosophical category. Since categories are
our basic principles of interpreting the given, the pragma-
tist theory of categories is an especially significant part of
their solution of the problem of knowledge and existence.
James lays down the principle that "our fundamental
ways of thinking about things are discoveries of exceedingly
remote ancestors, which have been able to preserve them-
selves throughout the experience of all subsequent times." *
He suggests that if we were lobsters or bees we might have
developed an entirely different set of categories, which
would have been just as useful as the set used today by
common sense. Aristotle and his followers tried to make
these common-sense categories eternal and static by treat-
ing them technically and articulately. The scholastic logi-
cians vainly tried to do what Aristotle failed to accomplish.
Kant's effort to formulate a complete table of categories
was likewise a miserable failure. And Hegel's attempt to
deduce one category from another, beginning with pure
being and culminating in the Absolute Idea, was the sheer-
est speculation. The truth is that all of these various lists
of categories are relative to a special point of view. No
categories are absolutely true, none are eternally fixed and
definite in meaning. The common-sense set is better for one
sphere of life, that of science for another and that of phi-
losophy for another. And each set has its defects. "All
seem insufficiently true in some regard and leave some dis-
satisfaction," says James. And this fact awakens "a pre-
sumption favorable to the pragmatistic view that all our
theories are instrumental, are mental modes of adaptation
to reality." Note the characteristic biological terminology.

PRAGMATISM
For pragmatists categories are biological instruments of a
human type, the sole purpose of which is to conserve, and
enhance life and to adapt it to its environment.
In an important article entitled The Social as a Cate-
gory,6 Dewey attempts to establish the priority of the
social over all other categories, as well as to demonstrate
that it has a right to be considered a separate and distinct
category. Of special interest are the other categories he
names along with the social and his theory of their relation
to the social. He begins by pointing out the utter impossi-
bility of beginning reflection with absolute simples, since no
such simples are ever discovered in actual experience. We
must begin with the complex, but with what complex? The
answer is the social. This fact alone is sufficient proof that
the social is a category. The other three categories listed
by Dewey are the physical or natural, the vital or organic,
and the mental. We may regard association as a purely
formal category which expresses the common factor in the
four special modes of association, but these four special
modes are the real categories of our thinking. Now the
social includes the physical or natural and any separation
of the two is a vicious abstraction. And the same is true
of the relation of the vital and mental to the social. The
social is certainly the most inclusive type of association
which we find in experience. There is a "genetic continuity"
between the natural, the vital and the mental which culmi-
nates in the social. "The social affords us an observable
instance of a 'realm of mind' objective to an individual,
by entering into which as a participating member organic
activities are transformed into acts having a mental qual-
ity." 6 Consequently the social is not only a category but
the very highest category we know or can know.
Harold Chapman Brown has discussed three important

lization, pp. 77ff.

pp. 294ff.
categories, namely, things, relations, and quantities, and he
has given a pragmatist interpretation of them which Dewey
has accepted. Brown argues that quality is more funda-
mental than quantity. Quantity is just one kind of relation.
But all relations, including quantitative ones, are derived
from quality. "Thing" is also an abstraction due to our dis-
regarding certain relations with the rest of the world.
Hence things, quantities, and relations are all aspects of
quality. But what is quality? It is ultimate and irreducible.
It comes from and is "genuinely concatenated existence,"
that is to say, it is the stream of reality itself. This stream
is "a qualitatively heterogeneous reality that can be vari-
ously partitioned into things." This qualitatively hetero-
geneous reality, this genuinely concatenated existence—
what is it but Dewey's category of the social? What is it
but the pragmatist's experience? In the end there is and can
be only one category for a pragmatist and that is the on-
rushing, creative whole of experience. All other categories
are but abstractions from this continuous and ever-pro-
gressing and growing whole. The given is an abstraction.
Every concept is an abstraction. Every category, save only
the social whole of experience, is an abstraction. In the end,
and in spite of the valiant effort of James to make it a
pluralistic theory of the universe, pragmatism must be
treated as a monistic metaphysics.7
Yet there is many a statement in pragmatist writings
which shows that there is an irreducible surd of irration-
alism in pragmatist metaphysics. The very idea of a given
implies the existence of something that falls partly outside
of experience. The ghost of Kant's thing-in-itself, which
supplies the human knowing machine with its material,
haunts this philosophy. Man has risen by a gradual process
of evolution out of an unknown and unknowable and recal-
citrant nature. What is his destiny when the eons of mak-
ing the world over a little nearer to the heart's desire have

all unfolded? Otto concedes that there is much scientific
knowledge to support a belief in man's final annihilation.
But he insists that there is yet time to work for human
betterment, ere the curtain falls and to him and his brother
pragmatists "that is what matters." Yet the admission that
"that is what matters" is at the same time an admission
that there is a surd of irrationalism in pragmatism. This
frequently expresses itself in agnosticism and positivism
with regard to the ultimate problems of philosophy. In
making the social their basic category the pragmatists seem
to use what Nietzsche would have called an "all too human"
ultimate principle to interpret reality.
PRAGMATIST THEORIES OF TRUTH AND ERROR
i. Truth and Meaning
DEWEY writes: "The realm of meanings is wider than
that of true-and-false meanings; it is more urgent
and it is more fertile. . . . Poetic meanings, moral mean-
ings, a large part of the goods of life are matters of rich-
ness and freedom of meanings, rather than of truth; a large
part of our life is carried on in a realm of meanings to
which truth and falsity as such are irrelevant." Elsewhere
he says: "Meaning is wider in scope as well as more pre-
cious in value than is truth, and philosophy is occupied
with meaning rather than with truth. Making such a state-
ment is dangerous; it is easily misconceived to signify that
truth is of no great importance under any circumstances;
while the fact is that truth is so infinitely important when
it is important at all, namely, in records of events and de-
scriptions of existences, that we extend its claim to regions
where it has no jurisdiction." 1
These two statements are fundamental to an understand-
ing of the pragmatist theory of truth. They show that the
scope of the problem of truth is narrowed to beliefs dealing
with actual events and to descriptions of actually existing
entities. All aesthetic, religious and moral experience of
meanings is excluded. Beliefs in these fields have meaning
but not truth. All philosophical beliefs are excluded. They
possess a value but not truth-value. The last word is im-

PRAGMATISM
portant. Pragmatists treat truth as only one species of
value. There are other species that are more important.
A knowledge of what truth-value is may be obtained with-
out dealing specifically with other types of value. This dis-
tinction does not aim to exclude truth from value. It aims
only to delimit the problem of truth as a problem within
the more general problem of value.
2. James's Statement of the Pragmatist Theory of Truth
William James's exposition of the pragmatist theory of
truth in Pragmatism and in The Meaning of Truth is the
best introduction to the more fully developed forms of this
theory of later writers. He writes: "True ideas are those
that we can assimilate, validate, corroborate and verify.
False ideas are those that we can not. . . . Truth happens
to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events. Its
verity is in fact an event, a process; the process namely of
its verifying itself, its veri-fication. Its validity is the process
of its valid-a/ion." 2
To elucidate what he means James uses an interesting
analogy. A bank-note is issued by a bank against gold that
is held in reserve. Any one may spend the bank-note because
it has the cash value of the gold held in the bank's vaults.
Or he may take the note to the bank which issued it and
get it redeemed. Now, says James, an idea or a belief is
like a bank-note. It was issued by the bank of experience
and its truth is the value it has in that bank. If we can use
it to buy other experiences with, it has just that much truth.
If we cannot, it is to just that extent false. Every idea or
belief has just and only as much truth as it has cash value
in experience. For example, the belief that there are tigers
in India means that anyone going into the jungle of India
will find actual wild tigers at large there. The going
through the experience of finding the tigers would be the
truth or the cash value of the belief. But, says James, we
2 William James: Pragmatism, p. 201 (Longmans). (James's italics.)
PRAGMATIST THEORIES OF TRUTH AND ERROR 273
hold many beliefs like this which are never actually veri-
fied by us. In practical everyday life we make use of a
credit-system of truth. We know or think that our beliefs
could be verified in the bank of experience, but we never
really go there to get their cash-value. We only do this
when the need arises. Hence many ideas are held true
which are not actually verified. Other ideas James calls
"petrified truths" because they were originally verified
many centuries ago but are still useful on various occasions:
for example, 2 + 2 = 4.
Schiller and Murray, one of Schiller's pupils, have ex-
pressed this idea by distinguishing between truth-claims and
truths. All ideas make a claim to truth, but only those
which lead to definite practical consequences may be said
actually to possess truth. The only way to test a truth-
claim is to use the idea in question as a working hypothesis
and note the consequences which result. If these are useful
the idea is made true, and if they are not it is made false.
Truths are claims which work well, and errors are either
claims which do not work well, or claims which are super-
seded by other claims which work better. What was true
becomes false when an idea which works better replaces
the old idea.
3. Application of James's Theory to Various Types of Ideas
In order to clarify still more his conception of truth
James applies it to three special classes of ideas—matters
of fact, purely mental (including mathematical) ideas, and
historical ideas. Let us consider these briefly in this order.
A. Matters of Fact.—Since the world we live in is full of
facts which can be either useful or harmful, ideas that tell
us which we may expect are true. James calls matters of
fact the "primary sphere of verification." For example he
takes a fateful experience of his own, that of being lost in
PRAGMATISM
the woods and of finding a cow-path.8 If in this situa-
tion I conceive the idea that there is a human habitation
that can be reached by following the cow-path, and if I
am thereby led to follow the path to safety, my idea be-
comes true. In this case the truth of the idea is not an end
in itself but is only a way of reaching other vital satisfac-
tions. The statements: "An idea is true because it is useful"
and "An idea is useful because it is true" are identical. The
words true and useful, or truth and utility simply express
different aspects of the same process. The idea which starts
the verification process is called true, and the beneficial
effects in which that process ends are called useful. But the
process itself is truth. "A leading that is worth while" is
what we mean by the truth of an idea about a matter of
fact. Having utility or being worth while may be inter-
preted either individually or socially, although beneficial
social effects are rated higher than effects that are only
beneficial to a single individual.
B. Purely Mental Ideas (Mathematical Concepts).—
Definitions and principles are ideas that are purely mental,
since their objects are purely conceptual. James gives these
examples: I and I make 2, 2 and 1 make 3, white differs
less from gray than it does from black, when the cause be-
gins to act the effect also commences. In these and similar
cases we see the relations involved by direct inspection, and
sense verification is unnecessary. Yet in this realm of pos-
sible relations truth is also "a leading that is worth while."
For we first relate our ideas together into logical and math-
ematical systems, and then we subsume the facts of expe-
rience under them. These ideas are useful because we can
use them to arrange the facts of experience, or, to put it
differently, because they aid us in ordering our sense expe-
riences. And, in the end, it is for this reason that they are
8 It is interesting to note that Dewey uses this same illustration in Etsap
in Experimental Logic, p. 2361., evidently borrowing it from James. He
elaborates James's view but accepts it in substance.
true, however much they may seem to be self-evident.
"Between the coercions of the sensible order and those of
the ideal order, our mind is thus wedged tightly. Our ideas
must agree with realities, be such realities concrete or ab-
stract, be they facts or be they principles, under penalty of
endless inconsistency and frustration." (James.)
C. Ideas of Past History.—Ideas about the past, e.g., the
belief that Caesar crossed the Rubicon, offer the pragmatist
a real difficulty. How can the truth of such ideas be identi-
fied with their function of leading? Both Dewey and James
agree that such ideas are verified by leading to the effects
of the past event which have continued into the present.
The belief that Caesar crossed the Rubicon can only be
verified by going to documents which are now in existence,
and which are the effects of Caesar's having crossed the
Rubicon. Thus James writes: "The stream of time can be
recounted only verbally, or verified indirectly by the pres-
ent prolongations or effects of what the past harbored."
And Dewey says: "The true object of a judgment about a
past event may be a past-event-having-a-connection-con-
tinuing-into-the-present-and-future. . . . The nature of the
past event is subject-matter required in order to make
a reasonable judgment about the present or future. The
latter thus constitutes the object or genuine meaning of
the judgment." 4
4. Dewey's Instrumental Theory of Truth
Although Dewey is in substantial agreement with James,
his own theory of truth was developed independently. It is,
therefore, worth while to note how far Dewey follows
James and to what extent he differs from him in dealing
with the problem. Fortunately Dewey has given us his reac-
tion to James's theory in an article entitled What Does
Pragmatism Mean by Practical?
* The quotation from James is from Pragmatism, p. 314, and the one from
Dewey is from the Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XIX, p. 312.
Dewey objects especially to the ambiguity in James's use
of the word practical. He points out that this term has at
least three different meanings: (i) the attitudes and con-
duct which objects induce in us, (ii) the capacity and the
tendency which ideas have to bring about changes in exist-
ing situations, and (iii) the humanly desirable or undesir-
able quality of certain ends. Correlated with these three
meanings of practical are three senses of meaning itself.
In the first place meaning may be simply the conceptual
connotation of a term—its essential attributes and quali-
ties. But it may also be the denotative reference of an idea
to existing things. The first of these meanings is sometimes
called the intensive and the second the extensive meaning
of a term, these being the same as connotation and denota-
tion in logic. But in the third place, meaning may refer to
the actual value or importance of anything for us. Now
when James discusses truth it is not clear whether truth is
the discovery of the true meaning of an idea, or whether
it is discovering what an idea must produce and how in
order to be true, or what the value of truth is once it is
discovered. Sometimes James seems to mean by truth "just
meaning that is genuine as distinct from empty and verbal."
Sometimes he is obviously talking about the value of truths
that already exist. But in other places James explicitly and
unequivocally recognizes that "only consequences which are
actually produced by the working of the idea in coopera-
tion with, or application to, prior realities are good conse-
quences in the specific sense of good which is relevant to
establishing the truth of an idea." Now it is this third
meaning which Dewey holds, and he thinks that James
should have held consistently to it. He writes: "Since Mr.
James has referred to me as saying "truth is what gives
satisfaction" (p. 234) I may remark (apart from the fact
that I do not think I ever said that truth is what gives satis-
faction) that I have never identified any satisfaction with
the truth of an idea, save that satisfaction which arises
when the idea as working hypothesis or tentative method
is applied to prior existences in such a way as to fulfill what
it intends." 6
James fails to define what is meant by satisfaction clearly
enough to distinguish the satisfaction of an idea from agree-
ableness to the agent using the idea. Consequently he lays
himself open to the charge of his opponents that his theory
would make any idea true which anyone happened to find it
agreeable to believe. This would make pragmatism the
worst type of obscurantism. To be true, Dewey thinks, an
idea must satisfy both personal needs of the person who
uses it and the requirements of objective things. It is a mis-
take of James to have held that satisfaction of the former *
alone constitutes truth. We cannot minimize the impor-
tance of the personal element, and James was undoubtedly
right in stressing the fact that temperament has a great
deal to do with what a human being believes. But the
requirements of objective things must also be met before
an idea can be true. What are the requirements of objective
things? Of course Dewey thinks that these are always con-
crete and definite, and that they grow out of some actually
existing situation in which the idea which claims truth was
generated. It follows that there are both natural and social
factors involved in these requirements, or perhaps we
should say physical and social, since social factors are also
natural. The social factors are especially important from
the standpoint of instrumentalism as developed by Dewey
and his followers, as we have already indicated in preceding
chapters. That idea is true which leads to a better state of
affairs for the interests of all whom the idea concerns. Bene-
ficial effects are never to be restricted to those which con-
cern the agent using the idea to meet his own particular
situation. They must include all effects of all individuals

Logic.
PRAGMATISM
and groups concerned in the situation. Instrumentalism is
predominantly a social theory of truth.
5. The Prediction Theory of Truth
Recent statements of the pragmatist theory of truth have
modified it still further into what has been called the pre-
diction theory of truth.6 According to this theory the
proper approach to a theory of truth is the general rela-
tion of thought to behavior. When an organism's behavior
has been blocked, thought sets to work to solve the problem,
and truth is a function of ideas at work solving behavior
problems satisfactorily. So far we have the central idea of
both James and Dewey. They had the right approach and
the right clue to what truth is. But they got lost in wander-
ing mazes when they tried to tell what is meant by the rela-
tion of truth to success in behavior. James especially "vacil-
lated between an emphasis on personal satisfaction and on
a satisfaction of the demands of the objective situation,"
as Dewey has rightly pointed out. But this same charge is
true of some of Dewey's discussions of truth. At least there
are, according to Morris, some passages in Dewey's writ-
ings "where truth comes perilously near to becoming a spe-
cies of the useful." Let us then approach the problem of
truth through the concept of prediction, and we shall be able
to reach a clear and distinct idea of the relation of truth to
behavior and an exact formulation of the pragmatist
theory.
What is prediction? It is an interpretation in language
of what will be found in some given region of experience.
If such a predicted experience is obtained, as predicted, the
prediction is true. Verified predictions are what we mean by
* This theory is briefly but clearly stated by Charles W. Morris in an
article entitled "The Prediction Theory of Truth," published in The Monitt,
Vol. XXXVIII, pp. 386ff. C. I. Lewis's recently published Mind and the
World Order shows a similar line of thought. See especially Chap. V.
But my exposition follows the article by Morris. See P. A. Schilpp's criticism
of Morris's theory in the same volume of The Monist and the rejoinder
of Morris.
truths. And we may take it that unverified, or negatively
verified, predictions are what we mean by errors. Now since
the predictions arise in a reflective process, all truths must
issue out of such processes. Most predictions require a long
time for their fulfilment. These remain live hypotheses un-
til the time of their fulfilment is at hand. But it is not nec-
essary to restrict the term prediction to the future. State-
ments about the past imply that the experience would have
been obtained as predicted, if certain conditions of space
and time had existed and there had been an observer.
Beliefs are secondary to predictions in the sense that they
are predictions that another prediction is true or false. The
statement: "Aristotle died in 322 B.C.," is a prediction.
When anyone says that he believes that Aristotle died that
year, we have another prediction which is a belief. The
primary prediction is independent of the belief, but the
truth of the belief is dependent upon the verification of the
primary prediction. As a matter of fact most of our verifi-
cations are concerned with beliefs, rather than with pri-
mary predictions. This follows from the fact that a belief
may have another belief depending upon it, making it the-
oretically possible to have a chain of beliefs, each depend-
ing on the other, with the first one dependent upon a
primary prediction. While Morris does not state this, it is
implied in his theory.
An important distinction is necessary. Some predictions
are directly concerned with behavior, that is to say, they
are either about behavior or the effects on behavior.
Other predictions involve behavior only as a means of
obtaining the predicted experience. While the latter pre-
dictions specify what must be done to obtain a certain end,
the good or bad effects on behavior are not in question, so
far as the truth or falsity of this particular prediction is
concerned. Consequently "the more inclusive theory of
truth which makes all judgments predictions of what is to
be expected under specific conditions, holds both for ex-
PRAGMATISM
pected experiences and for expected results on behavior.
Prediction is a more essential category for discussions of
truth than the categories of 'usefulness' or 'satisfactory'
working. On the present theory nothing not predicted is
relevant to the truth or falsity of the prediction" (Morris).
Thus the pragmatist theory of truth may be turned into
a prediction theory, and the consequences of a prediction
may be enlarged to cover both the effects on behavior and
future experiences, at the same time that they are restricted
to definite consequences issuing from a specific prediction.
This appears to be the strongest form of the pragmatist
theory of truth, although it is only in the making, and what
the ultimate form of it will be no one can foretell. More-
over, one may well raise the question whether this predic-
tion theory, if completely developed, would not require the
abandonment of the basic principle of the James-Dewey
theory.
PRAGMATIST SOLUTIONS OF THE BODY-MIND
PROBLEM
i. General Attitude of Pragmatists Towards This
Problem
THERE is no distinction more deeply embedded in all
language than that between the mind and the body.
Scientists and philosophers have wrestled with the prob-
lem of their relation since the very dawn of human reflec-
tive thinking. For centuries mind and body have been held
by at least some of the foremost philosophers of each age
to be basic categories which cannot be reduced to anything
more ultimate. And today, as we have already learned in
our discussion of realistic theories, dualism of mind and
body processes is still ably and vigorously defended. This
attitude is well expressed by William Brown, distinguished
British psychotherapist, in his article entitled Body and
Mind in the last (14th) edition of the Encyclopedia
Britannica. He writes: "What exactly is the relationship
between any particular form of mental activity and its
corresponding physiological correlate, or brain-event? Let
us take as a definite example the visual perception of a
patch of red colour. The physiological correlate of this ex-
perience is some kind of protoplasmic change in a definite
part of the occipital cortex—a change ultimately describ-
able in terms of molecular, atomic and intra-atomic move-
ments or vibrations. Obviously, the two sides of this rela-
tion are entirely different from each other." In this passage
Brown simply takes the distinction between mental activity
281
PRAGMATISM
and bodily activity to be ultimate and self-evident, as is
especially indicated by his last sentence.
Not so the pragmatist. He starts by denying the validity
of this distinction. Even though it is age-old and is still held
by eminent authorities, it is none the less fallacious. Body
and mind are not two, they are fundamentally and pro-
foundly one—this is the general attitude of pragmatists
towards this controversy. Moreover, the pragmatist insists
that the treatment of body and mind as distinct has had
the most disastrous consequences in human thought. For it
has caused one group of thinkers to ignore mind entirely
and to devote themselves wholly to the study of the body.
This has produced a one-sided materialistic and mechanistic
philosophy. Side by side with this group there has always
been another type of thinker who has completely ignored
body and who has developed a sentimental and false ideal-
ism. Such an idealism is ineffectual and deadening in its in-
fluence. It speculates, builds a world of dreams, and takes
refuge in that dream-world from the insistent demands of
the world of existence or nature which environs philoso-
phers and all men alike. Thus the distinction between body
and mind has been a breeder of opposed philosophies of
life, each of which is one-sided and false. The only escape
from these bad alternatives is to deny the premise on which
they are based. Body and mind are unified in experience.
How can this be demonstrated?
2. Dewey's Theory of the Body-Mind Unity
Dewey takes two attitudes towards this question of dem-
onstration. Sometimes he accepts the unity of body-mind
as an axiomatic and self-evident principle which needs no
other proof than the impractical and ruinous consequences
of any theory which treats body and mind as entirely sepa-
rate and distinct. In other words, the theory that the two
are indissolubly one is far more practical, enables the
thinker to avoid all the pitfalls and snares that are set by
distinguishing them, and consequently these highly prag-
matic considerations are all the proof the unity theory
needs or requires.
Yet Dewey is not really content to rest the matter there.
He develops an interesting line of argument to justify the
pragmatist form of the unity theory. This involves two dis-
tinct steps. In the first place, our approach to this problem
must be genetic. We cannot take a cross-section of the body-
mind unity and settle the problem by an analysis of that.
We must treat this unity as a process of growth, which is
one thing in a child, another in a youth, another in healthy
maturity, and still another in senility. This process, how-
ever, must also be looked upon as social and as continuous
between animals and men and plants and animals. This
thorough-going genetic or evolutionary point of view is
absolutely fundamental to the pragmatist solution of the
body-mind problem. But in the second place, Dewey insists
that there are distinct levels in this growing process and
that an understanding of the body-mind problem depends
upon distinguishing them. While there is no real distinction
between body and mind, there are distinct stages in the
evolution of the one process which is their unity. What are
these stages? This is an extremely important question for
the pragmatist.
The lowest level distinguished by Dewey is what he calls
the psycho-physical organism. Plants represent this level,
which is characterized by an organized activity of the need-
demand-satisfaction type. These hyphenated terms are used
in the strictly biological sense. Need means "a tensional
distribution of energies such that the body is in a condition
of uneasy or unstable equilibrium." Demand means "move-
ments which modify environing bodies in ways which react
upon the body, so that its characteristic pattern of active
equilibrium is restored." Satisfaction is "this recovery of
equilibrium pattern consequent upon the changes of en-
vironment due to interactions with the active demands of
the organism." Psycho-physical means that "physical activ-
ity has acquired additional properties, those of ability to
procure a peculiar kind of interactive support of needs from
surrounding media." What we have at this lowest level of
the body-mind unity is organization of energies. We do not
know the source of this organization but we have to accept
it as an ultimate empirical fact. It is a recognizable trait
of some events. To interpret this fact as proof of "a special
force or entity called life or soul" is a fallacious interpre-
tation. We have simply to accept the fact of a pattern
which can best be called a psycho-physical organism. The
student should note that this is a very special and technical
use of the term psycho-physical organism, which would not
be accepted by all philosophers who use this expression.
A slightly higher level is reached "whenever the con-
stituent parts of an organized pattern of activity are of
such a nature as to conduce to the perpetuation of the pat-
terned activity." Dewey calls this level sensitivity. The basis
284 PRAGMATISM
mals, with powers of locomotion and with distance-recej.
tors, are evolved. In this stage of the evolution of the body-
mind unity responses are such as to show discrimination
favoring some ends and rejecting others. It is this discrimi-
nation which constitutes sensitivity.
The feeling level is next reached through the complica-
tion of the organism's responses to the point where both
the distant in space and the future in time are responded
to. For now the activities of the organism are of two very
distinct types—those that are preparatory and those that
are fulfilling, or, to use a different terminology, those that
are anticipatory and those that are consummatory. This
produces the peculiar tension which Dewey calls feeling.
Once feeling has developed, it is capable of "receiving and
bearing distinctions without end." The more complex and
active animals have such rich feelings but they are not aware
of them.
MindJs the next level attained by the body-mind unity.
It comes when a creature, richly endowed with feeling,
"reaches that organized interaction with other living crea-
tures which is language, communication." Thus mind is
social from the beginning. At this level feelings get sense
and mean something. They get names such as pains, pleas-
ures, odors, colors, noises, tones, tastes, and other sense
qualities, and they are objectified as real traits of things.
Yet this objectification is not a psychologizing of nature.
These traits are there in things all the time just as much
as they are in the organisms. When mind arises, it comes
as a unity of physical and psychical. Mind does not origi-
nate as a purely psychical and individual soul, but as a unity
of bodily and psychical constituents which is social through
and through. Mind is "a moving stream, a constant
change which nevertheless has axis and direction, linkages,
associations as well as initiations, hesitations and conclu-
sions." 1
Dewey goes on to distinguish soul from mind. Soul is not
a non-natural entity nor is it possessed by everyone.
"Some bodies have souls preeminently as some conspicu-
ously have fragrance, color, solidity. . . . To say em-
phatically of a particular person that he has soul or a great
soul is not to utter a platitude, applicable equally to all
human beings." Likewise some souls are spirits, but not all.
"When the organization called soul is free, moving and
operative, initial as well as terminal, it is spirit." But
Dewey fears that such terms as soul and life and spirit
are too encrusted with mythology and "sophisticated doc-
trine" ever to become scientific. However, he thinks the
realities for which they stand are ultimate facts. Dewey
also distinguishes consciousness from mind. There is a con-

sition of Dewey's theory and those immediately following are taken from

sciousness at each level. At the level of psycho-physical
organisms consciousness is "the totality of actualized imme-
diate qualitative differences," but at the level of mind it is
the totality of "actualized apprehensions of meanings."
Mind is all meanings in general, but consciousness is those
of which one is aware at the moment, so that the field of
mind is "enormously wider than that of consciousness."
Thus Dewey has developed a strictly biological theory
of the nature of the unified body-mind being. How far his
view is from any transcendental conception of the soul is
especially clear from the following statement: "Every
'mind' that we are empirically acquainted with is found in
connection with some organized body. Every such body ex-
ists in a natural medium to which it sustains some adaptive
connection: plants to air, water, sun, and animals to these
things and also to plants. Without such connections animals
die; the 'purest' mind would not continue without them"
(p. 277 f.). Nor is there here any suggestion of angelic
essences or of any higher beings who may emerge in future
stages of evolution, such as Alexander's angels referred to
above. It is an essential dogma of pragmatism that human
organisms of the highest type are the apex of the evolu-
tionary process. Such human organisms are body-mind uni-
ties and the highest among them may be designated spirits.
Wordsworth wrote:
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
Hath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar:
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
From God who is our home.
This may be beautiful poetry but it is sheer mythology
to a pragmatist of the type of Dewey. James and Schil-
ler, however, might be more friendly to Wordsworth's
idea.
3. Bode's Teleological Theory
Boyd H. Bode, one of Dewey's disciples, has dealt at
length with the body-mind problem in the article entitled
"Consciousness and Psychology" published in Creative
Intelligence. He there develops a view similar to Dewey's,
but he approaches the problem from the basic distinction
of the focus and margin of consciousness in psychology.
According to Bode all consciousness exhibits this distinction
in some degree, but traditional interpretations of the dis-
tinction are all fallacious. We must treat the marginal
character of any given experience, say trying to recall a
forgotten name, "as simply a reference to its function as
a clue or cue to some further experience." In other words,
every experience has a dual character. It "sets a task" and
it "points the way." Hence the real distinction between
what is focal and what is marginal in an experience is
functional and not static. Intelligence is simply "the ability
to modify behavior through the anticipation of possible
consequences." The functional unity which has this ability
is not a mind and it is not a body, but it is an integrated
unity of both.
To make this clear Bode uses the illustration of a razor.
If a razor edge appears sharp there is correlated with this
appearance an "incipient response." If this incipient re-
sponse were to become an overt act, it would be an act of
cutting. But this actual or overt act is inhibited, giving rise
to a perception of a razor blade as sharp. It is due to the
blocking of the actual or overt response that a new kind of
stimulus arises, namely, the quality "will cut" or what the
object may do in future. Now exactly this is true of all per-
ceived objects. They are stimuli which guide the organism
to results, not yet real, but which may become real. When-
ever a contingent result becomes a stimulus to an organism,
that organism is a body-mind unity. It is "control by a
future that is made present" which constitutes conscious-
PRAGMATISM
ness, and consciousness does not exclude body, but the two
are rather one unified whole. This is entirely in accord with
Dewey's view and brings out another aspect of it.
4. Some Corollaries of the Pragmatist Theory of
Body-Mind
Let us now consider some applications of the theory
which has just been expounded to certain fundamental phil-
osophical problems, the answers to which are determined
by this general theory.
A. The Problem of Freedom.—What about man's ability
freely to choose what he will do in a given situation, if the
pragmatist theory of body-mind is accepted? Is human
freedom real or illusory? If real, is it individual or social?
These are ultimate questions of tremendous importance in
ethics and religion, and the attitude of pragmatists toward
them is rooted in their general theory of the biological
body-mind unity.
Three things are necessary in order that man may have
real freedom. The first absolutely indispensable condition
is that he be not restrained or interfered with in carrying
out overt actions. But freedom from restraint is purely
formal freedom. Men must also have actual control over
those energies required in the realization of purposes and
the satisfaction of desires. Yet freedom to satisfy desire and
to attain future ends is even possible, within limits, for
beings at the levels of sensitivity and feeling. Real freedom
implies both of these conditions, and also the possession by
the organism of an integrated nervous system which makes
possible powers of initiation and reflection sufficient for
selection of far-reaching and far-off goals. Only human
beings possess this kind of freedom. And there are varying
degrees of it among men. Those with souls have it to a far
greater extent than those who lack the finer type of organ-
ization essential to souls. And those with spirits have it to
a still larger extent. Yet always this human freedom is lim-

ited by a world of nature. As Dewey finely puts it: "A
mind that has opened itself to experience and that has
ripened through its discipline knows its own littleness and
impotencies; it knows that its wishes and acknowledgments
are not final measures of the universe whether in knowl-
edge or in conduct, and hence are, in the end, transient. But
it also knows that its juvenile assumption of power and
achievement is not a dream to be wholly forgotten. . . .
When we have used our thought to its utmost and have
thrown into the moving unbalanced balance of things our
puny strength, we know that though the universe slays us
still we may trust, for our lot is one with whatever is good
in existence. We know that such thought and effort is one
condition of the coming into existence of the better. As far
as we are concerned it is the only condition, for it alone
is in our power." 2
It follows that real freedom is social. It is through
human cooperation that the highest human achievements
are realized. Since mind is social even from its beginnings,
freedom is social. We find the highest level of freedom
realized in those social orders where creative work of all
kinds can be done. Man accomplishes more when he works
with his fellows to make a better world, and in such work
he comes into the fullest possible realization of his free-
dom. One of the values of philosophy is that it teaches us
that our common wants and ideals may be realized through
cooperation. In the words of Justice Holmes, quoted ap-
provingly by Dewey: "Philosophy does not furnish motives,
but it shows men that they are not fools for doing what
they already want to do. It opens to the forlorn hopes on
which we throw ourselves away, the vista of the farthest
stretch of human thought, the chord of a harmony that
breathes from the unknown."
B. Immortality.—In view of his theory of the body-
mind unity, what can a pragmatist say about immortality?
2 Loco citato, p. 420.
PRAGMATISM
We see that Dewey expresses a belief in the conservation
of whatever values we realize in our efforts. This much
seems to be implied in his statement "though the universe
slay us still we may trust, for our lot is one with whatever
is good in existence." There is, then, a kind of social im-
mortality or an immortality of influence. Whatever changes
are wrought in existence by mankind leave their permanent
mark on nature. The whole would not be what it is apart
from these changes. Hence the more values we realize, the
more improvements we initiate and carry through, the
greater the contribution we make to the meaning of exist-
ence. But personal immortality is out of the question on this
theory. There are no pure minds dissociated from bodies.
As dies the animal so dies man—without hope of immortal-
ity. For there is no
Living will that shall endure
When all that seems shall suffer shock.
Having turned its back on all forms of transcendentalism
and having deliberately built its theory of mind, soul and
spirit on biological foundations alone, pragmatism has no
place for that city of celestial spirits, that home of eternal
souls, whose builder and maker is God. Nor does it have
any place for that faith in "a height that is higher," so
beautifully expressed in Tennyson's By an Evolutionist:
I have climb'd to the snows of Age, and I gaze at a field in the Past,
Where I sank with the body at times in the sloughs of a low desire,
But I hear no yelp of the beast, and the Man is quiet at last
As he stands on the heights of his life with a glimpse of a height that
is higher.
For Tennyson is here obviously speaking of personal im-
mortality, and the evolutionism of pragmatism is thor-
oughly incompatible with a belief in personal immortality,
just as it is thoroughly incompatible with a belief in the
preexistence of the soul as expressed in the beautiful lines
of Wordsworth which were quoted above. The rejection
of both of these ideas of the soul is one of the practical
consequences of the pragmatist theory of a body-mind
unity.
William James, and some of his pragmatist disciples,
who are much more friendly to religion than the instru-
mentalists, refuse to accept this unity theory. In his famous
Ingersoll Lecture on Immortality James defended the
transmission theory of the relation of body and mind. On
this theory the body is merely an instrument of the mind.
But the mind may win its release from this instrument
without ceasing to exist. It may even find another "celes-
tial" or other kind of body through which to express itself.
This faith of James is well expressed in an interesting
letter to his dying sister in which he told her that her spirit
would be better able to express itself after its release from
the body.8 But to disciples of Dewey such a belief is utterly
inconsistent with our biological knowledge of the conti-
nuity of life from plants to men and of the indissoluble
unity of body-mind.

PRAGMATIST THEORY OF VALUE
i. The General Theory of Value of Pragmatism
IT is implied in the above exposition that theory of value
is the chief and most inclusive interest of pragmatism.
On this point all pragmatists may be said to be in substan-
tial agreement. When Dewey distinguishes meaning or
value from truth and treats meaning as the wider cate-
gory, he is exhibiting this pragmatic bias towards theory
of value. And when A. W. Moore speaks of truth-value as
being merely one kind of value, he is showing the same
tendency. In the words of James: "Truth is one species of
good, and not, as is usually supposed, a category distinct
from good and coordinate with it." Pragmatism might
, almost be defined as that philosophy which makes the
problem of value the fundamental problem of philosophy.
Not only is there general agreement among pragmatists
that value is the central problem of philosophy; there is
also a general definition of value which all pragmatists
accept. This definition was laid down early in the history
of pragmatism and it may be regarded as an essential prag-
matist dogma. When James said, in one of the essays of
The Will to Believe, "the essence of good is simply to sat-
isfy demand" (p. 301), he formulated a definition of good
which he had long held and which is embodied in his Prin-
ciples of Psychology. This principle was taken over by
Schiller and became the cornerstone of his humanism. In
one of his earliest works he wrote: "Good and bad also
(in their wider and primary sense) have reference to pur-
pose. 'Good' is what conduces to, 'bad' what thwarts, pur-
292
PRAGMATIST THEORY OF VALUE 293
pose." 1 And in the Graduate School of the University of
Chicago, H. W. Stuart, working under the guidance and
direction of Dewey, developed an essay which all instru-
mentalists recognize as being of cardinal significance to
pragmatist theory of value. It was published in Studies in
Logical Theory by Dewey in 1903 and is entitled Valuation
as a Logical Process. In this important essay the thesis is
laid down that all knowledge-getting, that is to say, all
judgment and attention whatsoever, is for the purpose of
obtaining some value or end. Accordingly the judgment
process is described as follows: "First of all must come a
sense of need or deficiency, which may, on occasion, be pre-
ceded by a more or less violent and sudden shock to the
senses, forcibly turning one's attention to the need of imme-
diate action. By degrees this sense of need will grow more
definite and come to express itself in a more or less 'clear
and distinct' image of an end, toward which end the agent
is drawn by desire and to which he looks with much or
little emotion." Here we have the earliest formulation
of Dewey's hyphenated trinity, need-demand-satisfaction,
which was defined above as the essential criterion of even
the lowest forms of living organisms.
Thus for the pragmatist the satisfaction of desire or
demand or need, which may be experienced by organisms .
as low in the scale of life as the algae, constitutes a value.
We may infer, a fortiori, that if such a satisfaction consti-
tutes a value, then any satisfaction of need or desire what-
soever will also be a value. Dewey well stated this general
theory of value of pragmatism, when he said: "Values of
some sort or other are not traits of rare and festal occa-
sions; they occur whenever any object is welcomed and
lingered over; whenever it arouses aversion and protest;
even though the lingering be but momentary and the aver-
sion a passing glance toward something else. ... Of im-
mediate values as such, values which occur and which are
1 F. C. S. Schiller: Studies in Humanism, p. 152.
PRAGMATISM
possessed and enjoyed, there is no theory at all; they just
occur, are enjoyed, possessed; and that is all." 2 We can
not go beyond or behind these immediate satisfactions of
desire to any value that is more ultimate. But we can and
must criticise these immediate values from the standpoint
of their relation to one another. Such a criticism leads us to
adopt some norm or standard of criticism. What is that
norm for the pragmatist?
2. The Doctrine of Meliorism
The place to look for this norm is in the pragmatist the-
ory of meliorism. This term is of Latin derivation, having
been built on the Latin word melior, meaning better. The
word is used in two senses. First, it is the doctrine, opposed
to both optimism and pessimism, that the world can be
made better by properly directed human efforts. And sec-
ondly, it is the doctrine that the world is neither entirely
evil nor is it as perfect as it can be, but it is gradually being
improved and perfected. This second meaning is what
Herbert Spencer had in mind when he spoke of "the meli-
orist view . . . that life ... is on the way to become
such that it will yield more pleasure than pain." The first
meaning was popularized by James Sully. He wrote: "By
this I would understand the faith which affirms not merely
our power of lessening evil—this nobody questions—but
also our ability to increase the amount of positive good."
Sully says that he took the word from George Eliot, who
said: "I don't know that I ever heard anybody use the word
meliorist except myself." 8
James took the word meliorism either from George
Eliot or, more probably, from Sully, and gave it a special
pragmatist interpretation. According to him meliorism im-
plies that there are gaps in the world, and these have to be

filled by human beings cooperating with whatever other
beings there are in the universe who are interested in mak-
ing things better. Every gap that is filled, every linkage that
is established between one part of this pluralistic universe
and another, improves the world just that much. The non-
human agencies cooperating with man in the filling of the
gaps were not specifically listed by James, but he undoubt-
edly meant a finite God and the spirits of just men who have
departed this life, for, as was pointed out above, James
believed in immortality.
There is a norm or standard of valuation implied in the
meliorism of James. We must rank immediate values
according to the degree of improvement they make in the
world. Those acts having the best consequences in the long
run are better than others, that is to say they give a greater
quantum of satisfaction and they contain more value. Thus
meliorism may be used as a principle of criticising values
and of ordering them in a better-worse series.
It is obvious that James took over this norm or standard
of criticising values from British utilitarianism. According
to this school of ethics moral value is constituted by the
principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number.
John Stuart Mill held this theory and James dedicated his
Pragmatism, in which he developed his meliorism, to Mill.
When we shift our definition of value from mere sense
pleasure to any satisfaction of demand or need, that is to
say, when we abandon hedonism—the theory that pleasure
is the only immediate value, and substitute a biological sat-
isfaction of need for mere pleasantness, we get a slightly
different theory of value. But the principle of the greatest
happiness of the greatest number can readily be adapted
to this biological theory. For then the norm becomes: the
greater the number of needs satisfied the greater the
amount of value. This is the principle of criticising values
which is implied in the theory of meliorism. We make a
better world by increasing the total quantum of satisfaction.
PRAGMATISM
There is, however, another norm implied in James's
meliorism and that is connected with his notion of co-
operation in the filling of the gaps and in the increasing of
satisfaction. To the extent that cooperation prevails over
individual and group competition, satisfaction can be and
is increased. Thus there arises in the very need-demand-
satisfaction process a deeper kind of need, and that is the
need for cooperation. The satisfaction of this need is really
a unique kind of satisfaction for a pragmatist, since the
satisfaction of so many other needs depends upon it. We
may call this a need of a higher order than that of mere
plant and animal need, although there is plenty of evidence
of the existence of this need among plants and animals.
However, this need only becomes conscious in men and
therefore it may be said to be what specifically character-
izes beings at the human level. All criticism of value from
the human standpoint assumes that the need of cooperation
must take precedence over all other needs. It is not self-
preservation, but social cooperation that is the first law of
human life.
There is, then, a deep-seated conflict in pragmatist the-
ory of value. Sometimes value means to a pragmatist any
immediate satisfaction of need or desire. But sometimes it
means preeminently the satisfaction of the need for co-
operation. Pragmatists make the tacit assumption that the
satisfaction of the need for cooperation will also satisfy all
other needs. They imply by their theory of meliorism that
cooperation in the filling of the gaps in the world will ipso
facto increase the total amount of satisfaction. It may do
this in two ways. In the first place, it may satisfy more of
the elemental needs already in existence. And secondly, it
may create more needs and satisfy them. But, unfortunately
for pragmatism, cooperation also demands the elimination
of actual desires. Consequently one kind of value may
destroy the other.
Later pragmatists have modified James's meliorism
chiefly by leaving out of consideration any non-human co-
operating agents. We must rely wholly upon the coopera-
tion of human agents in the making of a better world. As
Otto puts it, God "may be left out of account" and "the
only friends we human beings have" are "each other."
Meliorism as the theory that human beings, through intelli-
gent cooperation, are able to improve the world without
limit, and that they need no help in the meliorising process'
is the generally accepted theory of value of contemporary
pragmatists. It follows that pragmatism can never satisfy
the deepest of man's needs which expresses itself in the
longing for eternity. The greatest of the pragmatists admit
the existence of this need but they consider it a weakness.
Thus Dewey writes: "Sub specie aeternitatis? or sub specie
generationis? I am susceptible to the aesthetic charm of the
former ideal—who is not? There are moments of relaxa-
tion: there are moments when the demand for peace, to be
let alone and relieved from the continual claim of the world
in which we live tha1: we be up and doing something about
it, seems irresistible; when the responsibilities imposed by
living in a moving universe seem intolerable. We contem-
plate with equal mind the thought of the eternal sleep." 4
From the viewpoint of a transcendentalist the longing for
eternity is the deepest and the most worth while of all
human needs, but from the standpoint of pragmatism it is
a weakness that should be overcome by cultivating other
interests that are more social.
3. The Chief Types of Value and Their Relation
to Each Other
Stuart, in the article referred to above, has enunciated a
principle which has come to be generally accepted by prag-
matists, namely, that "all values properly so-called are -
either ethical or economic." The values of physical objects

above theory, and a refutation of it from the standpoint of idealism, see my
God of the Liberal Christian (Appleton), especially Chap. III.
PRAGMATISM
and of science are usually reduced to economic values and
the values of art and religion to ethical values. We must
note how the reduction is accomplished in each case. But
first let us consider the relation of ethical and economic
value.
A. Ethical and Economic Value.—These two kinds of
value are strictly correlative, since they are only the two
ends of the same process of valuation. If we assume that
every such process is an activity of adjustment of the organ-
ism to its environment, then the means used to make this
adjustment may be regarded as equivalent to economic
value, and the end attained, that is, the adjustment as a
completed and realized end, constitutes ethical value. We
can see this best in cases where ends or ideals conflict.
Suppose we have some relatively permanent habit estab-
lished by past acts. The end of this habit is a fixed and rec-
ognized value. Now let some new end appear which conflicts
with the end of this habit. Such a new end also involves a
large number of judgments, which together refer to the
means of attaining the end in question. We thus have two
sets of means and two different ends, and this enormously
complicates the situation which we have to meet. To find
an appropriate action to meet such a complicated situation
one must have "not simply a clearly articulated knowledge
[of these complexities] but also a knowledge of oneself."
But it is important to note that the self we thus know in
action is "the energetic self." In so far as the two ends are
judged by the self to be mutually exclusive, an ethical mode
of adjustment is made. But suppose that this exclusiveness
is judged by the self to be purely external, and that the two
ends are entirely compatible within the self. Then the mode
of adjustment is indirect and concerns the means, and we
may call this economic. Hence ethical value is concerned
primarily with the direct adjustment of ends that are
judged to be incompatible. It means choosing one of these
ends and rejecting the other or moulding a new compromise
end which will take the place of both. But economic value
is concerned with adjusting the means in such a way that
both ends can be attained. Now when we choose or reject
a given end we do it because it fits or conflicts with our
whole system of habits and their respective ends. In this we
never create any new values nor do we ever recognize pre-
existing values. What we do is to fix or adjust values of the
immediate need-demand-satisfaction type for the time be-
ing, knowing that this fixation or adjustment is continually
subject to reappraisal as the self grows. In ethical reflec-
tion we do not create but rather organize values. "The
ethical experience is one of continuous construction and re-
construction of an order of objective reality, within which
the world of sense-perception is comprised as the world of
more or less refractory means to the attainment of ethical
purposes." 6 And these more or less refractory means are
economic values.
B. The Values of Facts and Science.—In the above ac-
count we have already implied that the particular facts of
sense experience serve as means to ends in the valuation
process. Hence they have economic value. But the same is
true of the general laws of science. If some especially ob-
durate fact refuses to be organized as a means to our ends,
we judge it to be subject to some law of necessity which
thwarts our purposes. Such laws of nature, which are gen-
eralizations from experience, it has been one of the glories
of science to have discovered. They express "aspects of ex-
perienced existence" and they give "insight into reality."
But why do these laws of science have value, or what is
their value? In answering this question the pragmatist
points out that these laws make predictions of the future
possible and consequently "they are instrumentalities en-
abling men to further their desires" (Otto). Thus the
values of science are essential economic values. The laws of
science are means to the realization of human purposes.
s Studies in Logical Theory, p. 299 (University of Chicago Press).
PRAGMATISM
Science was made for life, and not life for science. Science
has value only to the extent that it satisfies the insistent
needs of life. Just as the scholastic philosophers of the Mid-
dle Ages subordinated scientific knowledge to religious
faith, so the pragmatist philosophers of today subordinate
scientific knowledge to the needs of human conduct and
behavior.
C. Aesthetic Values.—James H. Tufts, more than any
other pragmatist, has developed a theory of the relation of
aesthetic value to economic and to ethical value. Although
his theory differs somewhat from Stuart's, it conforms
with it. He distinguishes between two sorts of stimuli—
those that are simple, monotonous and easily analyzed and
those that are variable and complex and towards which con-
stant adjustment and readjustment is necessary. The ob-
jects that satisfy our immediate wants we consume and
throw away and they are valuable only in relation to our
immediate wants. But objects of the second type are more
durable and they are bi-focal. That is to say, such objects
respond to us when we respond to them. They are social
beings and the relations between them and us are personal
relations. Between the economic value of things and the
moral value of personal relations stands aesthetic value.
Aesthetic objects are quasi-personal things. For they are
works of art in which the artist has embodied his thought
and feeling. The aesthetic object is an object of contem-
plation or of embodied meaning. Aesthetic values function
in the valuation process sometimes as means and sometimes
as ends, but they are always social. Hence we may say
that aesthetic values are reduced to ethical or moral values
rather than to economic.
C. I. Lewis would not agree with Tufts. He identifies
aesthetic value with the satisfaction which accompanies the
immediate experience of any given or datum. This satis-
faction he calls pure esthesis. When the given is taken just
as it is and for what it is, and is not judged or interpreted
in any way, we have esthesis. And this is what we mean by
aesthetic value.
D. Religious Value.—The characteristic attitude of prag-
matists towards religious value is the denial of its exist-
ence as a specific type of value. Religion is the belief in and
the effort to secure the conservation and the enhancement of
all socially recognized values. In this sense all values be-
come religious values. We should not set up some one
religious value and seek it. We should seek to conserve and
enhance all socially recognized values. This is the essence
of religious value. One might almost say that religious value
is a kind of quality of optimism which accompanies the
process of valuation. To believe that this process is itself
worth while and that its ends are attainable—this is reli-
gious value.6
4. Corollaries of the Pragmatist Theory of Value
Let us now draw certain obvious inferences from the
pragmatist theory of value, treating them as corollaries of
that theory.
A. Eternal or Transcendental Values.—From the days
of Plato and earlier to the present men have believed in the
existence or reality of a supra-temporal and supra-spatial
world of eternal spiritual values. To the Greeks truth, good-
ness, and beauty formed a special trinity of such values.
They are the ever-recurring themes of Plato's Dialogues.
And they have intrigued the mind of man through all the
intervening centuries. But it follows from the pragmatist
biological theory of value that there are no eternal or
transcendental values. All values are transitory: they arise
and they pass away in the process of adjusting wants and
needs to the environment. Spinoza's surrender of such tran-
sitory goods as pleasure and honor and glory for the pursuit
• Edward Scribner Ames in my Anthology of Recent Philosophy, p. 539,
expressly says: "In stating what are the values of religion, it may be said
at the outset that religion has no values of its own. The values of religion
are also other kinds of values at the same time."
PRAGMATISM
of a single, unchangeable and absolute good is to the prag-
matist a surrender to weakness. This is clear from the quo-
tation from Dewey above, to which may be added his state-
ment that "the philosophy which tries to escape the form of
generation by taking refuge under the form of eternity will
only come under the form of a by-gone generation."
It is true that William James did not wholly share this
absolute repudiation of all transcendental values. He recog-
nized the need of a transcendent God, even though he con-
ceived of Him as finite, to aid men in the work of social
melioration. And, as we learned above, he especially applied
the pragmatic method to prove the existence of such a God
in his famous "will to believe" argument. But as early as
1908, in an article on Pragmatism published in the Edin-
burgh Review, Bertrand Russell pointed out the deep-seated
contradiction in this line of argument and the basic ideas of
pragmatism. Time has proved that Russell was right. Con-
temporary pragmatism has completely repudiated every
transcendental value and the use of the "will to believe"
as a proof of a transcendent God. It has revised its con-
ception of God until every transcendent aspect of deity has
been completely eliminated. God must either be identified
with the process of valuation and of social melioration or
be left entirely out of account. Some pragmatists do leave
Him entirely out of account while others identify Him with
the valuation process in its entirety.7
B. The Nature of Evil.—It is obviously a corollary of
the pragmatist theory of value that evil is primarily nega-
tive. It may be defined as unsatisfied desire or as social
maladjustment. The former corresponds to what used to be
called physical evil and the latter to moral evil. Sin is not
recognized as a scientific concept by pragmatists. A. Eus-
7 The essay by Russell has been reprinted in his Philosophical Essays.

Religion and A. Eustace Haydon: The Quest of the Ages. See my criticisms
of their views in The God of the Liberal Christian (Appleton), especially
Chaps. IV and V.
tace Haydon calls it a "primitive concept." Evil is to be
faced realistically. It must be dumped overboard. It must
be completely eradicated. "How are we to get rid of evil?"
replaces for the pragmatist the traditional problem of
"How are we to reconcile the existence of evil with a per-
fect God?"
TYPICAL OBJECTIONS TO PRAGMATISM
I. The Dilemma of Pragmatism
IN Present Philosophical Tendencies R. B. Perry calls
attention to a dilemma of pragmatism. This dilemma
has been elaborated more in detail by A. O. Lovejoy in his
article entitled Pragmatism versus the Pragmatist. Let us
first state this dilemma as Perry gives it and then show how
Lovejoy elaborates it.
Pragmatism is fundamentally a naturalistic and biological
theory of knowledge. Mind is subordinate to existence or
nature or what Lewis called the given. There are "laws of
necessity" to which man's mind must submit. There is an
obdurate environment to which life must adapt itself.
Knowledge is what changes. The structure of the world
which generates the knowledge processes and the structure
of the world in which that process ends does not funda-
mentally change. Yet, on the other hand, the pragmatist
insists that existence itself is man-made. There are no fixed
and static facts. The laws of nature come from our cate-
gorizing activity. They are our creations. Here is an irrec-
oncilable contradicition in pragmatism. To escape it either
the pragmatist must turn towards subjective idealism and
treat nature as wholly the creation of the human mind, or
he must turn towards realism and admit that nature is inde-
pendent of and creative of mind. Thus it is the inevitable
destiny of pragmatism to be absorbed by one or the other
of the two great types of philosophy—idealism or realism.
It cannot stick to its vacillating and wavering attitude on
so fundamental an issue.
304
Lovejoy elaborates this argument by going through
Dewey's writings and selecting two sets of quotations, one
of which shows the idealism and the other the realism in
pragmatism. Yet there are other passages in which Dewey
sharply criticises epistemological dualism—the theory that
ideas belong to a mental realm and that facts belong to a
non-mental world. And there are others where he strongly
denies the idealistic interpretation of his statements, and
still others where he denies equally strongly the realistic
interpretation. What, then, are we to conclude in the light
of these various sets of passages? What is Dewey's real
view? Lovejoy thinks that it is impossible to discover it,
and he proposes to reconstruct pragmatism to show that it
is inherently contradictory. "This does not mean that we
shall make up a new doctrine out of our heads and name it
pragmatism. We shall in every case reason from principles
actually held, and insisted upon, by writers of this school.
We shall find that these principles are incongruous with cer-
tain other principles, or at any rate with certain modes of
argument and certain specific conclusions, which are put
forward by the same writers. We shall discover a deep
inner conflict in the 'pragmatism' of the pragmatists, an
opposition of underlying logical motives, from which the
ambiguities and contradictions that we have already noted
in their utterances naturally enough arise. This conflict, we
shall see, is incapable of adjustment; one of the opposing
principles or the other must simply be abandoned. And we
shall find reasons for holding that one of these principles is
not only sound in fact, but is also, in a quite definite sense,
the more profoundly and distinctively pragmatic." 1
Thus the new realist, Perry, and the critical realist, Love-
joy, agree that there are certain basic principles at the heart
of pragmatism that are incurably contradictory. Yet these
principles are essential to the philosophy. The critics think
that the presence in pragmatism of such inherent and deep-

PRAGMATISM
seated contradictions will ultimately force its disintegra-
tion. It cannot endure as a distinct type of philosophy, but
its idealistic doctrines will ultimately be absorbed into ideal-
ism and its realistic doctrines into realism.
2. The Subordination of Knowledge to Action
The charge has been made against pragmatism that it
makes all of our needs practical, and that thought exists
only for the sake of action. Thus Aliotta writes: "All the
efforts made by Anglo-American pragmatism to reduce the
cognitive function to the practical function and knowledge
to action cannot fail to appear vain to the unprejudiced man
who analyses the distinctive characters of the two func-
tions." 2 Montague made the same charge against prag-
matism and showed his criticisms to Dewey. The latter dis-
claimed teaching that all our needs are practical and insisted
that he only meant to teach that no need can be satisfied
without action. Originally all human needs were practical,
but other kinds of needs have arisen in civilized life. For
example there are aesthetic, scientific, and moral needs that
are not primarily practical. Yet in satisfying them action is
required. Dewey also denied that he ever said that thought
exists for the sake of action. What he said was that activity
is a part of the cognitive process by which we reach imme-
diate and non-practical consequences. The modifications
which Dewey here makes of these charges are interesting
in that they show that he is aware of the seriousness of the
charges. Montague published Dewey's answers, as well as
his own criticisms, indicating that he regards the charges as
holding good for pragmatism in general but accepting
Dewey's reservations so far as Dewey's own instrumen-
talism is concerned.8
Yet, even though there is activity present in knowing,
2 Professor Aliotta: The Idealistic Reaction against Science. English trans-
lation by Agnes McCaskill. P. 185. (Macmillan and Co., Ltd.)'
•See W. P. Montague: The Ways of Knowing, pp. 154f. (note).
Aliotta is undoubtedly right in stressing the basic differ-
ences, not acknowledged by pragmatists, between "cogni- .
tive doing," "artistic doing," and "practical doing." In the
first type of activity we are opposed by something which
has an independent reality and which will not yield to our
wishes. Our activity may be one of the factors in reality
but it is not the only one. To reduce all actions to practical
doing, where we actually construct what we want, is to
ignore this element of opposition which we find in cognitive
doing. "Pragmatism, which accepts blindfold and dogmati-
cally the biological origin and meaning of mental life, ends
by contradicting its own postulate, when it denies the pre-;
supposition of all natural selection, that is to say, the objec-
tive physical order" (p. 187). Of course pragmatists deny
that they do this. But if they really grant the existence of
an independently real objective physical order, they must
admit the ultimate impossibility of our remaking the world.
All that we can do is to modify it up to a certain point. In
the end we must submit to it. We can never change the ob-
jective pattern of relations. Thus if we see the mercury
rise in a thermometer following a rise in temperature, we
can make any modification we please in thought such as
imagining one to increase without the other or one to in-
crease and the other to diminish. All this does is to change
the psychical relations to the facts. The external physical
relations remain the same. But practical activity is not so
restricted. It modifies things in their physical structure.
Hence, even though Dewey's statement is accepted, and we
hold that activity is present in knowing, we must recognize
that it is not practical activity. Cognitive activity remains
unique and the cognitive relation to an object can never be
subordinated to the practical relation.
3. Criticisms of the Pragmatist Theory of Truth
No part of pragmatism has been more severely attacked
than the pragmatist theory of truth. When James originally
PRAGMATISM
stated it, there was a storm of protest. Idealists and realists
vied with each other in riddling it with criticisms.
A. Moore's Critique of James's Theory of Truth.—In
Philosophical Studies (Harcourt, Brace & Co.), G. E.
Moore has republished his essay on James's Pragmatism in
which he sharply criticised the theory of truth of James.
The three basic assertions of James are (i) truth is con-
nected with utility, (ii) truth is in some sense 'mutable' and
(iii) truths are man-made.
Moore analyses the first of these assertions into four
others: (i) that we can verify all of our true ideas, (ii)
that all our ideas that we can verify are true, (iii) that all
our true ideas are useful and (iv) that all of our ideas that
are useful are true. He then proceeds to give examples that
refute the first of these assertions. Thus we are often un-
able to verify a belief that we wrote something in a letter,
even though it is true, since many letters are destroyed.
Historians are often concerned with true ideas they cannot
verify because the documents are lost. Moore is willing to
accept the second assertion, but the third he attacks with
examples to the contrary. Thus many true ideas, even such
as 2 plus 2 equals 4, are useful only at certain times. But
it is true even when it is in the way and a hindrance. Men
often dwell on their faults when it is not useful for them to
do so, even though their faults are real. To the reply that
every true idea is useful at least once, Moore cites examples
of ideas that appear only once and that are not useful then.
Thus idly counting the dots on a playing card is of no use
yet culminates in our knowing how many there are. Our
minds are continually noting details we never use. Turning
to the fourth assertion, that all our useful ideas are true,
Moore cites lies that are useful in wartime but that are not
true. False ideas and absolute fictions are very often useful
on the whole and in the long run.
Turning next to the general proposition that truth is
mutable, Moore interprets this to mean that an idea could
be false at one time and true at another. Is this possible?
No, says Moore, it is self-evident that an idea once true is
always true. If it is true that / am in this room and we
mean by this "the idea of the connection of my being in
this room with this particular time—it seems to me evident
that anybody who had thought of that connection at any
time in the past, would have been thinking truly, and that
anybody who were to think of it at any time in the future
would be thinking truly" (p. 138). Here is at least one
fundamental sense in which truth is not mutable.
With regard to James's assertion that our truths are
man-made, Moore points out that this involves saying not
only that we make our beliefs but that we make them true
or false. It cannot be doubted that we make our beliefs.
But do we make them true? Some of them we may make
true, namely, those about acts that are within our power.
Thus if someone believes that another person will do some-
thing, such as writing a book, and he writes it, then he
makes his friend's belief true. But to say that we make all
of our beliefs true would lead to such absurdities as saying
that we had a hand in causing the French Revolution, or in
building the pyramids, or in creating the Alps Mountains.
We believe in the reality of these things, but we do not
make these beliefs true.
B. Royce's Critique of the Pragmatist Theory of Truth.
—In an article entitled Error and Truth, published in Hast-
ings's Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Royce points out
an interesting difficulty in the pragmatist theory of truth.
In order for that theory to be true we have to assume that
an idea retains the same meaning from the time it is sug-
gested until it is verified by its practical effects or conse-
quences. Obviously there is often a very long time interval,
since the complete effects of an idea take considerable time
to happen. This is especially true of many scientific ideas.
Newton's ideas of space and gravitation are still being veri-
fied in experiments now being made in connection with the
PRAGMATISM
Einstein theories of relativity. The effects of these experi-
ments have to be regarded as a part of the effects of New-
ton's idea. How can we verify the assumption that
Newton's idea of space is identical with Einstein's idea of
Newtonian space? "Nobody experiences, in his own person,
or at any one time, the identity of the ideas, meanings, ex-
pectations, of yesterday and today, of himself and of an-
other person, of Newton and of the later students of Na-
ture who have tested what they believed to be Newton's
ideas. One may, in each special case, doubt, therefore,
whether the idea formed yesterday is the same in meaning
as the idea tested today, whether two men mean the same by
the hypothesis which they are trying to verify together, and
so on" (Royce). But this has to be true, or the whole prag-
matist theory is meaningless. Yet, if it is true, it constitutes a
kind of truth that is not identical with effects or consequen-
ces. No man can test such a truth, and if it is true, as it must
be in order for the pragmatist theory of truth to be true,
then it is true for some other reason than its consequences.
Hence there is involved in the very statement of the prag-
matist theory of truth an assumption the truth of which can-
not be determined by that theory. That theory rests back
upon an assumption the truth of which is not what pragma-
tism says truth must be.
C. Retrospection and Retroactive Judgments.—Lovejoy
charges pragmatism with making retrospection impossible.
He gives three reasons why retrospection is "the Cinderella
of the pragmatist theory of knowledge." It is not necessary
here to go into those reasons, but Lovejoy is undoubtedly
right in calling this denial of the possibility of retrospection
a "fantastic paradox" to common sense. Lovejoy is espe-
cially interested in retrospection from the standpoint of an
individual whose personal memory is the source of knowl-
edge of the past, but he mentions also the "recorded results
of empirical science" as furnishing a sound basis for a
retrospective judgment about a past event that extends be-
yond the private experience of any one individual. Love-
joy argues that the pragmatist has to assume that "knowl-
edge about the past is equivalent, within limits, to prediction
about the future; but this, as Hume rightly showed, is a
belief which is not itself susceptible of any empirical veri-
fication." 4 There can be no question but that Lovejoy has
here raised a fundamental issue from the standpoint of the
pragmatist theory of truth.
However, he does not take into account the explicit
statement of James that "new experiences lead to retro-
spective judgments, using the past tense," and "what these
judgments utter was true, even though no past thinker had
been led there." And a little further on James says: "This
regulative notion of a potential better truth to be estab-
lished later, possibly to be established someday absolutely,
and having powers of retroactive legislation, turns its face,
like all pragmatist notions, towards concreteness of fact,
and towards the future." 6 Lovejoy's criticisms were espe-
cially directed against Dewey's instrumentalism, yet what
are we to think of these statements of James in the light of
those criticisms? Does James's theory of truth make pos-
sible retroactive judgments, whereas Dewey's does not? Or
was James here asserting what his fidelity to common-sense
forced him to assert when it was actually in conflict with the
pragmatist theory? I think that the latter is true. Retro-
active judgments are not compatible with the conception
that truth is constituted by the effects an idea has in the
future.
Yet who can deny that scientific judgments are retroactive
in the sense that they hold of individual instances which ex-
isted long before they were discovered? Who can doubt
that the earth was revolving around the sun on the day of
battle when Joshua is said to have made the sun stand still,
even though that was centuries before Copernicus discov-
* Loco citato, p. 7a
5 Pragmatism, pp. 223 and 224. (Italics mine.)
PRAGMATISM
ered that the sun is the centre of the solar system? Who
can doubt that the proposition, "Socrates's blood circulated
in his body" was a true statement when Socrates lived and
drank the hemlock, even though Harvey's discovery of the
circulation of the blood was not made until after 1600 A.D.?
Yet if truth is constituted by predicted effects which occur
after an idea is suggested, how could any judgment be true
before any previous thinker was led to it? Morris says
that such predictions would have been true had there been
the proper physical conditions and had there been an ob-
server. But in the case of Socrates both these requirements
are met. Surely Plato can be regarded as a competent ob-
server. Yet he did not know that Socrates's blood circu-
lated in his body. From the record Plato has left of the
effects of the hemlock on Socrates, who walked about until
his legs became numb and then sat down, we know that the
circulation of the blood is what carried the poison through
Socrates's body. Yet Plato, and the others who were pres-
ent at Socrates's death, did not know this. Nevertheless it
was true then, prior to the effects which Harvey used to
prove his theory that the blood circulates in the human
body. Hence the truth of such a theory cannot possibly be
identified with the effects the idea produces, or with its
verification and validation, to use the words of James. Re-
troactive judgments are so well attested that they alone are
a sufficient refutation of the pragmatist theory of truth.
4. The Illicit Naturalizing of Values
In a masterly essay entitled "The Illicit Naturalizing of
Religion," 6 Hocking has pointed out the root defect in the
pragmatist interpretation of religious values and beliefs.
But his argument can be extended to all transcendental
values1—to those of art, science, and morality as well as to
those of religion. By its biological theory of knowledge
pragmatism is forced to deny the very existence of supra-
* See Journal of Religion, Vol. I, pp. 561-589.
mundane values. Suppose that it be admitted that human
beings have a biological structure which they share with
animals. Suppose that it be further granted that at his best
man has become so much more complicated in his biological
functioning than other animals as to be capable of creat-
ing culture and all the values that accompany the highest
cultures that we know. Let it be acknowledged that our
cultural values are the outcome of centuries of biological
and social evolution and that they are to that extent of
the earth, earthy. Yet does this prove that they are purely
human and wholly man-made? By no means. It still remains
possible and plausible that some transcendental spiritual
being was enough interested in this process of history to
use it for the realization of these values. Who can say that
these higher cultural values are entirely biological in their
essence? Who knows that these values are not also appre-
ciated by non-biological beings? Yet pragmatism is forced
by its theory to say what it cannot prove. It dogmatically
denies the existence of transcendental values. It restricts the
world of value to earth and its creatures. It knows no reality
that is alien to man and is non-human. The social in the
human sense is its highest category. One might adapt
Perry's egocentric predicament fallacy here and say that
pragmatism argues from the socio-centric predicament that
there are no transcendental values. We as human beings
know ourselves to be part of a social order which has been
reached through millions of years of biological and cul-
tural evolution here upon the earth. Therefore all of our
values are entirely relative to this process. But the fact that
these values were attained by us in this process is no proof
that they share the biological and sociological nature of the
process. To say that they do is an illicit naturalizing of
values. Such a position is due to our socio-centric predica-
ment. The idealistic view that the whole evolutionary pro-
cess has meaning only to the extent that it succeeds in cre-
ating ethical and spiritual personalities and in bringing them
into union with all other ethical and spiritual beings
throughout the whole of reality is certainly just as plaus-
ible, once we refuse to be bound in our thinking by the
socio-centric predicament. Pragmatism's root defect as a
philosophy is, to use again the phrase of Nietzsche, that it
insists on making everything "all too human." There are un-
doubtedly non-human realities, even though they enter into
or are in relation with human beings. We must never lose
sight of the fact that there may be a level of reality above
the human level, which gives meaning to that level.
5. The Impracticability of Pragmatism
Finally, and paradoxically, in view of its insistence upon
practicality, pragmatism is profoundly impractical. In re-
stricting human efforts to what is achievable in the biologi-
cal and social evolutionary process a profound and logical
love of life is cut off. If this philosophy is true, the world
certainly lied to a good many of its saints to whom a spir-
itual world of values which transcends our earthly finitude
was eternally real. They turned their backs on the world
and sought for a city whose builder and maker is God. And
they tell us that they found it and we see by their labors and
characters that the discovery enormously magnified their
power, at the same time that it gave them an inner calm and
an outward repose. Were they deceived? Has the world
lied to its saints and its sages? Is it really impossible to
solve the problem of problems, impossible to gain insight
into the ultimate meaning of life? Must we treat the long-
ing for eternity as a weakness and eradicate it from our
minds? Then the ultimate incentive of all of our striving
is removed. Then the basic postulate on which all philoso-
phizing rests is nullified. And pragmatism must ultimately
agree with Oswald Spengler that "the very possibility of a
real philosophy of today and tomorrow is in question," and
that "it were far better to become a colonist or an engineer,
to do something, no matter what, that is true and real, than
to chew over once more the old dried up themes under
cover of an alleged 'new wave of philosophic thought.'"
There is indisputable evidence in the literature of pragma-
tism that practical activities and social reforms are the
things that are treated as being of the most importance.
But when this view is taken philosophy is already drying up.
Montague refers to a type of "up-to-date" student of
philosophy who, tackling the classical literature of phi-
losophy and lacking either the background of knowledge or
the intellectual acumen to comprehend it, turns with relief
to pragmatism. "If there is no objective reality apart from
human interests and beliefs it may seem unnecessary to
bother oneself about the problems of traditional philoso-
phy. Philistine minds will be tempted to mask their incom-
petency with the boast that the puzzles that they have
failed to solve were 'unreal,' 'old fashioned,' 'dialectical'
subtleties with which a practical man in a practical age need
not concern himself. Like the fox in the fable, if we fail
to get the grapes we can save our face by calling them
sour." 7 In so far as pragmatism lends itself to this inter-
pretation and use it is impractical in the deepest sense of the
word. For such a use of philosophy, and such an attitude
toward the literature of philosophy, cannot be universalized
without destroying philosophy.

OTHER TYPES
TYPES PREDOMINANTLY IDEALISTIC
i. Neo-Idealism
IN classifying contemporary idealism in Part II, Chap-
ter I, mention was made of the idealism of Benedetto
Croce and Giovanni Gentile in Italy. Bosanquet and others
have called this Neo-Idealism, and since it stands somewhat
apart from other forms of idealism and practically no atten-
tion was given to it in Part II, let us give a brief resume of
it here.
Neo-Idealism has been developed on an Hegelian basis,
and it shares with the other types of Neo-Hegelianism an
acceptance of the fundamental principle of the concrete
universal and the basic dialectical method of reasoning. But
Croce points out that Hegel's use of the dialectical method
is defective in that he ignored the underlying difference be-
tween a relation between entities that are merely distinct
from each other, and that between entities that are real
opposites in their internal nature. One type of concrete
universal is a unity of opposites and the other type is a
unity of distinct entities. For example, imagination and in-
tellect form the unity of imagination as employed in Art
and Poetry, and this unity is a concrete universal. But imag-
ination and intellect also form the unity that is employed
in philosophy, yet this unity comprises Art and Poetry, and
hence it is a concrete universal of a higher order. Thus in
the case of a concrete universal which is formed by a syn-
thesis of distinct entities there are degrees of concrete uni-
versality, and the distinct entities are relatively independent.
But this is not true of the concrete universals which are the
319
OTHER TYPES
unities of opposites. Here both opposites are abstractions
and neither has separate reality such as distinct entities
have. Because Hegel failed to recognize this fundamental
difference, he set up an illegitimate distinction between
Spirit and Nature. This he was never able to overcome with
his panlogism and his identification of reality with ration-
ality. Spirit does not stand opposed to Nature but contains
Nature within itself.
Consequently Neo-Idealism abandons the notion of a
transcendental Absolute, and of a transcendental realm of
reality which stands in sharp opposition to the world of ap-
pearance. The Absolute is an immanent Spirit, working
itself out in history. Two forms of the mind's activity
lead equally well to a recognition of this Spirit. One of these
is the theoretical activity which produces art and philoso-
phy. It yields the beautiful and the true as its basic values.
The other is the practical activity which produces eco-
nomics and ethics. It yields the useful and the good as its
basic values. These four values are concrete universals and
each one of them embodies the whole of Spirit under some
one of its aspects. But they are not opposites or mere ab-
stractions. Each is a distinct and independent entity, and
the union of the four constitutes the concrete universal par
excellence—the Absolute Spirit. Yet each of the four dis-
tinct values or concrete universals is itself a unity of oppo-
sites. Beauty is a union of beauty and ugliness, in which
ugliness is overcome. Truth is a union of truth and false-
hood, in which falsehood is overcome. Moral goodness is
the unity of the good and the bad, in which the bad is over-
come in perfection of character. Utility is the union of the
useful and the worthless, in which utility overcomes worth-
lessness.
Hence Croce's interpretation of Neo-idealism makes two
fundamental and original assertions: (i) Aesthetics or the
philosophy of art is of central importance among the philo-
sophical disciplines. (ii) The Absolute Spirit is an imma-

nent, indwelling process or activity, and not a transcendent,
perfect and static intelligence. In developing these two fun-
damental doctrines Croce goes even further than Hegel in
subordinating religion to philosophy. The latter gives us
truth in pure logical and conceptual form, whereas the
former is primarily a synthetical and symbolical repre-
sentation of the Absolute Spirit. Hence religion is destined
to be gradually displaced by philosophy as culture advances.
Croce's philosophy makes the Absolute Spirit, or the
whole of reality, a concrete universal that is made up of
four other distinct concrete universals, using the word "dis-
tinct" in the sense explained above. This raises the question
of how all five of these concrete universals can be equally
real. Giovanni Gentile attacks the distinction between the
Absolute Spirit and the four values by denying that theo-
retical and practical activity are really separate types of
activity. They differ only relatively. From the standpoint
of theoretical activity the world is given ready-made, but
from the standpoint of practical activity the world is yet
to be made. Spirit is the unity of the knowing-doing activity,
according to Gentile. Hence this thinker's philosophy is
called Actual Idealism. He calls spirit or mind pure act.
As Angelo Crespi puts it: "Gentile's idealism calls itself
actual just because it starts from this initial concrete think-
ing act and proceeds to explain everything as due to the
movement from concrete thinking to abstract thought." 1
But Gentile goes on to show that this thinking act is not the
act of an empirical self, or ego, but that of a single imma-
nent Ego or Spirit. Spirit thus begins as a subjective activity
in which the thinking activity is the whole of the spirit. But
it discovers its unity with all other spirit, and its freedom
from all external limitations. And spirit is also a continual
process of becoming and hence it is identical with history.
1 Angelo Crespi: Contemporary Thought of Italy, p. 155 (Knopf). See
Giovanni Gentile: Theory of Mind as Pure Act (Macmillan & Co.) and
De Ruggiero: Contemporary Philosophy (Allen & Unwin).
Only spirit is also self-conscious. It knows its history and
its nature. This self-knowledge of spirit is philosophy. Thus
"Actual Idealism" offers itself "as the supreme vindication
of the freedom and worth of the human mind, since, on
these lines, Man as Spirit is his own world, and there is no
world beyond Man" (Crespi). It will be obvious to the
reader that there is a close similarity between Gentile's
fundamental position here, and that of the social idealism
into which pragmatism seems to be emerging in some of its
younger disciples. But it is far from being indentical with
the rigorous logical instrumentalism of Dewey.
2. Vitalism
One of the most significant features of the thought of
the twentieth century has been the rapid expansion and
enrichment of the biological sciences. One distinguished
authority, J. S. Haldane, has argued that mankind is turn-
ing away from a civilization built primarily upon mathe-
matical and physical science to one based essentially on bio-
logical knowledge, and that the next few centuries will
mark far greater advances in biology than the past cen-
tury. However that may be, there can be no question but
that biology has been coming into its own in recent years.
Now one of the philosophical expressions of this highly
significant fact is the philosophy of vitalism. The term
vitalism was formerly used to mean "the doctrine that
ascribes all the functions of an organism to a vital principle
distinct from chemical and other physical forces" (Cen-
tury Dictionary). But vitalism has recently come to mean
the metaphysical theory which makes life or the principle
of life the essence, or a part of the essence, of all reality.
Hocking has given this philosophy the name of bioism, but
there is no particular reason why the established term vital-
ism should be displaced by the term bioism.
A. The Vitalism of Bergson.—Henri Bergson has de-
veloped the most influential type of vitalistic philosophy.
His doctrines have been widely accepted in England and
America, where he still has many ardent disciples and
admirers. But even more important has been the tendency
for realists, pragmatists and idealists to absorb Bergson's
vitalistic theories. He has especially influenced William
James, the pragmatist; McGilvary, Whitehead, and Joad,
who are avowed realists; and G. Watts Cunningham, H.
Wildon Carr, and R. F. A. Hoernle, all of whom are dis-
tinguished idealists. Although we classified Bergson as a
monistic idealist in Part II, Chapter I, many writers regard
him as a vitalist, rather than as representing any one of the
three main types of contemporary philosophy. The over-
whelming importance of Bergson in contemporary philoso-
phy is indicated by Isaac Benrubi's unquestionably true
statement: "Bergson's life work is at once the culminating
point and focus of all the progressive tendencies in French
philosophy of the present day." And he is also equally right
in holding that "Bergson's philosophy is not to be pigeon-
holed under the label of any existing 'ism.' " 2 Let us, then,
recognize the many-sidedness of this distinguished French
philosopher, who has been awarded a Nobel Prize in Liter-
ature, and who is undoubtedly one of the supremely great
men of our age. But let us also emphasize the type of vital-
ism of which he is the founder.
This vitalism is expressed in Bergson's famous phrase,
elan vital, which was first used by him in a technical sense in
L'evolution creatrice (1907), which Arthur Mitchell has
translated into English under the title Creative Evolution
(1911, Holt). The phrase elan vital summed up for Berg-
son the doctrine that there was an original life force or vital
impetus, and that it has passed from one generation of liv-
ing beings to another by way of developed individual organ-
isms, they being the connecting links between the genera-
tions. This life force is conserved in every line of evolution
of living beings, and it causes all of the numerous varieties
3 Isaac Benrubi: Contemporary Thought of France, pp. 169 (Knopf).
of living forms and creates all new species. It divides itself
more and more as it advances. "All life, animal and vege-
table, seems in its essence like an effort to accumulate
energy and then to let it flow into flexible channels, change-
able in shape, at the end of which it will accomplish
infinitely varied kinds of work. That is what the vital
impetus, passing through matter, would fain do all at once.
It would succeed, no doubt, if its power were unlimited, orr
if some reinforcement could come to it from without. But
the impetus is finite, and it has been given once for all. It
cannot overcome all obstacles" (p. 253 f.).
According to Bergson the vital impetus creates matter
as a by-product of its activity. He compares the movement
of life to that of a sky-rocket, matter being the dead sparks
that fall behind the advancing flame of the rocket. But the
vital impetus is not moving towards any fixed, predeter-
mined or final end. Bergson repudiates what he calls final-
ism or static teleology. The only purpose he is willing to
recognize is an immanent teleology within the vital impetus
itself.
B. Driesch's Vitalism.—Hans Driesch, German experi-
mental embryologist who turned philosopher, has developed
an original vitalistic philosophy which is quite different
from that of Bergson. In the first place, Driesch's vitalism
is much more restricted than Bergson's. He denies that crea-
tive evolution applies to the physico-chemical level of real-
ity. Founding his vitalism on his researches in embryology,
he argues that embryological development is non-mechan-
istic and chiefly determined by the presence in the develop-
ing embryo of a life principle called, after Aristotle, entel-
echy. But every organism has its own distinct entelechy,
and there is no single entelechy, such as Bergson's Han
vital, operating in all living beings. At least this is true of
Driesch's embryological vitalism. He recognizes a more
inclusive vitalism which he calls phylogenetic development.
By phylogeny Driesch means the theory of descent in the
broadest possible sense, and he says that phylogeny is
"composed of the sum-total of all embryologies." For this
whole evolutionary process he postulates a "superpersonal
phylogenetic entelechy." This entelechy is comparable to
Bergson's elan "vital, since Driesch regards phylogeny as
"one coherent process," whose ultimate source is this super-
personal entelechy. But this whole evolutionary process has
an ultimate end, even though men cannot say that the evo-
lution of the human species is that end. What the end is to
be we do not know. This whole phylogenetic process is the
unique phenomenon of life. However, when we seek, to ex-
plain the cause of so unique and distinctive a phenomenon
we find that there are two equally good explanations of the
emergence of phylogeny or the phenomenon of life, and
that we are absolutely incapable of deciding which is cor-
rect. One of these explanations is that the Superentelechy
created life after its own nature, which it had prior to the
beginning of phylogenetic evolution. And the other is that
the essence, or nature, of Superentelechy is being made or
evolved with phylogenetic evolution. It is obvious that
Driesch uses the term entelechy in two quite different senses.
In his embryological vitalism it is the inner principle de-
termining the growth and development of every living or-
ganism. In his phylogenetic vitalism it is a single principle of
the whole evolution of life, called Superentelechy and iden-
tified with God and with Bergson's elan vital. In his His-
tory and Theory of Vitalism Driesch shows how important
vitalism has been in the history of philosophy, from Aris-
totle to the present day, and he also states the chief proofs
and indicia, or evidences, for the doctrine.
C. Eucken's Activism.'—The only other philosopher ever
to win a Nobel Prize in Literature is, like Bergson, usually
classified as a vitalist, and that is Rudolph Eucken who
called his philosophy activism. His starting point is much
less biological than that of Driesch and Bergson and more
historical. Eucken's chief interest was in the self-conscious
OTHER TYPES
cultural life of human beings rather than in the life force in
plants and animals. Hence his general doctrine is even
nearer to other types of contemporary idealism than is that
of Bergson. Nevertheless he shares with Bergson a hostility
to the intellectualism of Absolute Idealism, and he shares
with Driesch the attitude of irrationalism suggested by the
impossiblity of deciding between the two opposed in-
terpretations of Superentelechy's relation to phylogeny.
Eucken postulates the reality of a super-individual and
super-social spiritual life. This spiritual life is absolutely
independent of our experience of it. We come to know of
its existence through the life of action. "Action," he says,
"is the best defensive weapon against the dangers and
tricks of human existence." And again: "Doubt is not cured
by meditation, but by action." We must act in order to know
the deepest truths, even though our activity entails suffer-
ing. "Not suffering, but spiritual destitution is man's worst
enemy." It is the power of the spiritual world of activity
which is alone able to arouse man to spiritual activity. And
in this activity he reaches a fuller realization of what life
is and of life's ideals. Eucken expressly condemns those in-
terpretations of life which make it a mere process—"a soul-
less mechanism." The ethical must be made "the motive and
progressive power of the spiritual life itself," if we are to
avoid interpreting life as a mere process. And this is the
essential feature of Eucken's activism as set forth in his
most important systematic work.8
D. The British Vitalists.—A number of prominent phi-
losophers of England are defenders of vitalism. Joad has
adapted the vitalism of Bergson to a realistic type of meta-
physics. J. A. Thompson has argued that life is inexplicable

The German title of this work is Grundlinien einer neueren Lebens-
anschauung. The English translation was made by A. C. Widgery and
published by Adam and Charles Black. Note the similarity between Eucken's
activism and Gentile's actual idealism, and see the discussion of religious
pragmatism below, p. 351.
if we deny the existence of some kind of vital impulse or
creative energy within each organism. J. S. Haldane has
stressed the need of recognizing the wholeness and organic
coordination of the organs and cells of every living being.
J. C. Smuts, in Holism and Evolution, has invented the
term holism as a name for the vital principle, and he goes
so far as to argue that this principle of holism is present
at every level of reality. Both Thompson and Smuts are
panpsychists to the extent that they assert the presence of a
non-mechanical vital activity in every natural object. In the
personal statement of his philosophy in Contemporary
British Philosophy Thompson calls his view methodological
vitalism and defends what he calls the "heresy of panpsy-
chism."
3. Individualism and Self-Expressionism
Another widespread tendency in contemporary philoso-
phy, ably represented by a number of gifted thinkers in dif-
ferent countries, is known as individualism. It especially
protests against the tendency of so many modern philoso-
phers to exaggerate the importance of the social and of the
physical sciences, and to make them the basis of philosophy.
According to individualism the personality of each inde-
pendent thinker,—including his prejudices, sentiments, and
emotions,—must be made the basis of all sound philoso-
phizing. Out of the actual crises of individual experience
arise the problems which lead to the development of that
person's philosophy. According to the individualists, "Ex-
press thyself!" is the first law of life. Find out what your
peculiar life work is and enter upon it with enthusiasm, for
you are the most ultimate reality you will ever discover. In
the words of Thomas Carlyle: "Blessed is he who has
found his work; let him ask no other blessedness."
In this country Warner Fite has long defended this view-
point with especial vigor, most recently in his essay entitled
"The Impersonal and the Personal" in Contemporary
American Philosophy. But Fite refers especially to the dis-
tinguished Spanish philosopher, M. Unamuno, in whose
Tragic Sense of Life this point of view has been persua-
sively presented. The same general doctrine has been most
interestingly presented in the writings of Count Hermann
Keyserling, especially in the widely read Travel Diary of a
Philosopher and in The World in the Making, in the latter
of which he gives an excellent autobiographical sketch,
showing how he worked out his own philosophical position.
Fite holds that the fundamental question is: What is it
to live?, not What is life? And he quotes his own earlier
Moral Philosophy: "It seems to me that he who in this
human sense is at home in the world, who in the circle of
family and kin finds an ever-satisfying affection and under-
standing, and in his friends an intelligence ever responsive
to his tastes, has the best that life has to offer; and that he
who lacks these lacks everything" (p. 286). And according
to Unamuno the flesh and blood men, who stand behind the
bookish and pedantic caricatures of the great philoso-
phers, built their systems to satisfy the urgent vital yearn-
ings of their souls. The will to live, the hunger for immor-
tality, self-love, if you like, identifies itself with all that
lives, and ardently longs to survive this earthly life. Pre-
cisely this longing is the tragic sense of life. Keyserling
lays down the basic principle of all individualism and self-
expressionism when he says: "The best method by which
a man can find out the truths which apply to all is to study
his own mental processes; and he can therefore best serve
the needs of all by realizing his own ideal of spiritual per-
sonal increase." 4 In the end all individualists would agree
with Fite's credo: "Having in mind what it is to live, I
feel that to think of this human life as 'social progress'—
from the 'public' point of view—is inconceivably trivial. I

Maurice Samuel (Harcourt, Brace & Co.). The quotation from Fite is from

and W. P. Montague and published by The Macmillan Company.
can think only of the countless men and women who have
been passionate and have expended time and zeal; for
whom, as for you and me, life has been a tragic experience.
And then I think that if I could conceive of a realm of be-
ing in which none of those lives would ever lose its vitality,
in which no soul which has been passionate would ever cease
to live—a realm of being not by any stretch of imagination
to be put within the boundaries of the natural world—if I
could see this, then I should know that I had found a ra-
tional universe, a real universe, a spiritual universe, and a
universe religiously significant." Verily a stirring statement
of the modern longing for immortality, and a striking
proof that that longing has not yet been destroyed by
naturalistic thinkers 1
4. Some Nationalistic Philosophers
In addition to Unamuno, who is generally recognized as
the true symbol of his beloved Spain, there are some other
distinguished contemporary philosophers who have identi-
fied themselves with their national culture, and who have
especially interested themselves in interpreting philosophy
in terms of their particular culture. Foremost among these
is T. G. Masaryk, President of the Republic of Czecho-
slovakia, who is also President-elect of the 8th Interna-
tional Congress of Philosophy, which will convene in
Prague in 1934. Masaryk's philosophy is essentially a cul-
tural idealism. He is favorably known because of his
critique of Marxianism. In Poland Lutoslawski has long
been recognized as the expositor of a cultural idealism
based upon Polish culture. He is an extreme individualist
who believes that the souls of men are eternal, and who has
developed a unique form of spiritual pluralism. And in
India the gifted philosophers S. Rhadakrishnan and Das-
gupta, have re-interpreted the classic idealism which is so
deeply rooted in the culture of India. Into the details of
OTHER TYPES
these philosophies of distinct cultures we cannot here enter,
but they are destined to exercise a permanent influence upon
the intellectual growth of the peoples among whom they
have originated.
TYPES PREDOMINANTLY REALISTIC
1. Phenomenology
THE most important philosophy of the twentieth cen-
tury in Germany is known as phenomenology—the
science of phenomena. It was founded by Edmund Husserl
and its earliest form is found in his Logische Untersuch*
ungen, originally published in two volumes in 1901, but re-
published in four volumes in 1928. Husserl gives Franz
Brentano credit for having made important contributions
to the basic principles of phenomenology. But Husserl him-
self is the real originator of this type of philosophy, and
a number of his able disciples have elaborated and applied
the phenomenological method to every branch of philoso-
phy. Among these contemporary German phenomenologists
are M. Scheler (died in 1928), who especially applied the
method to ethics and general theory of value; M. Geiger,
who applied it to aesthetics; M. Heidigger, who applied it
to ontology; Jean Hering, who applied it to the philosophy
of religion; and A. Pfander, A. Reinach, E. Stein, and
others, who have written important treatises expounding
various aspects of the doctrine. In 1913 Husserl founded
the philosophical periodical entitled: Jahrbuch fur Pha-
nomenologie und phanomenologische Forschung, and it has
appeared regularly since then. In the volumes of this journal
that have been published there are numerous valuable
technical discussions of this philosophy. Husserl's Ideas has
recently been translated into English and he wrote a valu-
able article on Phenomenology for the new (14th) edition
of the Encylopedia Britannica. Phenomenology has estab-
33i
OTHER TYPES
lished itself firmly in Germany and it is now spreading to
other lands. It is generally recognized as one of the major
tendencies in contemporary philosophy, and as being more
closely related to realism than to idealism or pragmatism.
Yet it certainly contains many idealistic doctrines. In Impli-
cation and Linear Inference Bernard Bosanquet subjected
Husserl's logical theories to criticism and indicated their
relation to the logical theories of Absolute Idealism. Un-
doubtedly Husserl is greatly indebted to Kant and to Hegel,
but phenomenology may be regarded as a modern epi-
stemology constructed to replace the Kantian. Nevertheless
it is in the direction of realism. This philosophy is so tech-
nical and intricate that we will only attempt to characterize
briefly the chief types. But first let us define a few of the
important technical terms used by phenomenologists.
The original meaning of the Greek word for phenom-
enon is that which displays itself, and this sense is retained
by the phenomenologists. Phenomenon is a perfectly gen-
eral term which refers to what ever displays itself to any
consciousness. It means "the being present of an object."
The term is used in a different sense in natural science,
where it refers to the appearance of some real thing. In
phenomenology there may be phenomena when there are no
real things of which they are the appearances. For example,
the null class in logic, fairies, round squares, centaurs, et
cetera. In fact any conceptual object displays itself when-
ever it is thought about, and is, therefore, a phenomenon.
Phenomenology is the science of all phenomena, whether
they are the appearances of real things or are purely con-
ceptual and fanciful. Brentano's term intentional, which he
adopted from the scholastic philosophers, plays an impor-
tant role in phenomenology. By this term the phenomen-
ologists mean "the essential 'reference' character of the
phenomena," i.e., the fact that we always intend objects and
that each object which we intend has its own intentional
structure. To use Husserl's own example: "The perception
of a cube reveals a multiple and synthesized intention: a
continuous variety in the 'appearance' of the cube, accord-
ing to differences in the points of view from which it is seen,
and corresponding differences in 'perspective,' and all the
difference between the 'front side' actually seen at the mo-
ment and the 'backside' which is not seen, and which re-
mains, therefore, relatively 'indeterminate', and yet is sup-
posed equally to be existent." Phenomenologists use the
term noetic to mean experiencing and the term noematic
to mean the experienced. And they use the term eidetic,
from the Greek word U5os, to mean the essence or form
of any phenomenon as distinct from its factual character.
Eidetic reduction means the treatment of phenomena with
respect to their pure form, ignoring their factual character
entirely.
A. Psychological Phenomenology.—Husserl thinks that
there is an absolutely universal, pure and a priori, or ra-
tional, psychology, parallel to natural science. Its chief task
is to investigate the various types of intentional structure
of phenomena, with a view to reducing these to what he
calls the prime intentions. These constitute "the nature of
the psychical" and "the being of the soul." But we may
also discover the intentions of which the social life con-
sists. Phenomenological psychology is the first level of
phenomenological interpretation of reality.
B. Eidetic Phenomenology.—The intentional structures
dealt with in psychological phenomenology still retain an
objective and empirical content. To reach a more formal
phenomenology it is necessary to abstract this away, purg-
ing the phenomena of absolutely every empirical and psy-
cho-physical element. By so doing we arrive at the bare
essence, or form, or eidetic structure of phenomena. As
Husserl puts it: "The phenomenology of the perception of
bodies, for example, will not be an account of actually
occurring perceptions, or those which may be expected to
occur, but of that invariable 'structure,' apart from which
OTHER TYPES
no perception of a body, single or prolonged, can be con-
ceived. The phenomenological [psychological] reduction
reveals the phenomena of actual internal experience; the
eidetic reduction, the essential forms constraining psychical
existence." (Encyclopedia Britannica, 14th ed., Vol. XVII,
p. 700.) Later Husserl calls this process the "rationaliza-
tion of the essential."
C. Transcendental Phenomenology.—Husserl defines
the transcendental as "the quality of that which is con-
sciousness." And he says that we have to recognize that
"relativity to consciousness is not only an actual quality of
our world, but, from eidetic necessity, the quality of every
conceivable world." Now transcendental phenomenology
deals with the ultimate structure of all consciousness, and
takes us a stage beyond eidetic phenomenology. At this stage
the subjective "I" and the social "we" are completely
replaced by the "transcendental I" and the "transcendental
we," and both of these are unified in one concrete tran-
scendental consciousness. This is undoubtedly pure tran-
scendental idealism.
D. Ontological Phenomenology.—Yet we may go a step
further and develop a universal "first philosophy" that will
combine all sciences—mathematical, logical, natural, and
social. Since phenomenology is the science of all phenom-
ena, it is the science of all possible existence and existences.
As such phenomenology studies the formal structure of all
being whatsoever. In this ontological phenomenology are
included all rational and intelligible problems of every
science whatsoever. "Phenomenology is not less than man's
whole occupation with himself in the service of human rea-
son." Here, again, Husserl seems to be almost wholly an
idealist.
Yet he at once adds that "phenomenology demands of
phenomenalists that they shall forego particular closed
systems of philosophy, and share decisive work with others
toward persistent philosophy." And there can be no doubt
but that he regards Absolute Idealism as a particular closed
system. The phenomenalists share the conviction and
the assurance that it is now possible, in the light of recent
advances in knowledge and using the phenomenological
method, to rebuild the ancient citadel of "first philosophy,"
and to establish on a permanent foundation, that is neither
idealistic nor realistic, the "science of the sciences." 1
2. Irrationalism
One of the most influential philosophies of the twentieth
century was originated by fimile Meyerson. He was born
in Russian Poland, but he has lived most of his life in Paris
and his writings were originally written in French. His phi-
losophy has come to be known as Irrationalism. In his
epoch-making Identity and Reality (1908), an English
translation of which appeared in 1930 (by Kate Loewen-
berg) from the third French edition of 1926, L'explication
dans les sciences (1921), La deduction relativiste (1925),
and in the article entitled Explanation in the 14th edition
of the Encylopedia Britannica, Meyerson has worked out
this theory in great detail, supporting it with his amazing
knowledge of the history of natural science. Einstein has
referred to Meyerson's "brilliant studies in the theory of
knowledge." Lord Balfour, J. H. Muirhead, and others
have praised Meyerson highly. As a result of the high
quality of his writings his theories are gaining wide recog-
nition at the present time.2
1 See also Paul A. Schilpp's article "Max Scheler 1872-1928" and the ref-
erences to his other articles on Scheler contained therein, Philosophical
Review, Vol. XXXVIII, pp. 574ff. Another good account of phenomenology
is Marvin Farber's Phenomenology as a Method and as a Philosophical
Discipline, University of Buffalo Studies, Vol. VI, 1928. Farber studied with
Husserl after studying logic at Harvard. He has a thorough understanding
of Husserl's system, as well as of the symbolic logic of the mathematical
logicians. Hence his monograph is of special value to the student of phenom-
enology. See also W. Tudor Jones: Contemporary Thought of Germany,
Vol. I, Chap. VI, for a more popular account of phenomenology.
2 See the article on Meyerson in the Saturday Review of Literature,
Vol. V, p. 1171. See also George Boas: A Critical Analysis of the Philosophy
of Smile Meyerson. For a French critique see M. Gillet: La Philosophie de
M. Meyerson in Archives de Philosophie, Vol. VIII, 3.
OTHER TYPES
Meyerson's fundamental theory is that true scientific
explanation is reached, not by finding laws or even causes,
but by using the principle of identity or the schema of identi-
fication. He holds that the work of the scientist in making
any scientific explanation is the establishing or, in any case,
the affirming of identity between an event and its antece-
dents, and that this holds in spite of the acknowledged dif-
ferences between them. In other words, all scientific ex-
planation presupposes that reality is rational, that there
are separate fibres, to use Lord Balfour's term, in reality,
which the mind can single out and follow through, and that
"the schema of identity constitute the eternal framework
of the mind," so that all the sciences are thoroughly per-
vaded by these schema. So far Meyerson seems to be accept-
ing the idealistic thesis of the identity of the structure of
the real and the rational.
Yet it is just at this point that he introduces his doctrine
of irrationality. For the differences the mind seeks to ignore
in using its principle of identity refuse to be left out of
account. When a principle of explanation is carried through
to the very end it confronts these differences. They require
another principle of explanation. And this conflict, in which
all scientific explanations end, is due to an irrationality in
reality itself. In Identity and Reality, Chapter IX, and in
De l'explication dans les sciences, Book I, Chapter VI, and
Book IV, Chapters XVI-XVIII, Meyerson discusses at
length the nature and the diverse forms of this irrationality.
A single illustration must here suffice to illustrate what he
means.
Suppose that we think of a wave motion of light stimulat-
ing the retina of the human eye, and setting up a current
in the sense organ which terminates in the cortical area of
the brain. Corresponding to this purely mechanical motion
in the nerve and brain tissue there is a sensation of light or
color. Science can explain what motion is in mechanical
terms and it can explain what a sensation is in psychical
terms, but it can never explain "the manner by which
mechanical movement is transformed into sensation." We
can never make the relation between such diverse entities
as mechanical movements and sensations intelligible. Yet
this relation is an actual fact which nobody can question.
And this fact Meyerson calls an irrational. This term, he
says, "has the advantage of clearly indicating that it is a
question of a fact, which we believe to be certain, but which
remains and always will remain incomprehensible, inaccessi-
ble to our reason, irreducible to purely rational elements."
And he then adds that "in admitting the existence of this
limit we affirm not only that we shall never succeed in un-
derstanding this 'irrational,' but that we shall never ap-
proach this understanding—that we shall approach only
the limit." 8
3. Mechanism
In sharp contrast to vitalism stands contemporary mech-
anism. Many thinkers defend a purely mechanistic theory of
mind and of vital phenomena. Behaviorism in psychology is
really a metaphysical mechanism. But one of the most in-
teresting types of contemporary mechanism is that set forth
by the distinguished Italian positivistic philosopher, Eu-
genio Rignano. He calls his theory vitalistic finalism, but
it is not like any of the vitalisms discussed above.
Rignano assumes that the physical world is constituted
out of energies of various types. He speaks of "all the ener-
gies of the inorganic world" being differentiated from ner-
vous energy solely by the presence in the latter of the.
mnemonic property. Adaptation to environment is not a
distinctive characteristic of vital energy, since even chemi-
cal systems reestablish their equilibrium when it is dis-
turbed. What physico-chemical systems lack is the mne-
monic property, and that means the capacity to reproduce
the ways of adapting themselves "solely through internal
3 fimile Meyerson: Identity and Reality, p. 298. Translated by Kate
Loewenberg and published by The Macmillan Company, 1930.
OTHER TYPES
causes." It is this property which makes living energy ca-
pable of being influenced from in front instead of merely
from behind. The mnemonic accumulation in the living or-
ganism functions as an inner force which directs the organ-
ism's development and behavior. From this fact there arises
an eternal conflict between "the essentially finalistic micro-
cosm and the purely mechanical macrocosm." Reason makes
us affirm the universality of mechanism, but feeling makes
us affirm the reality of purpose and of directedness towards
an end. "This opposition between reason and sentiment will
never have an end, unless perhaps man resigns himself to
search for the ultimate reason of his conduct, the supreme
purpose of his existence, no longer in the whole universe
but rather in the narrower domain of life, with which he
has community of origin and nature." 4 But that Rignano
thinks that man should so resign himself is clear from his
claim to have proven the utter futility of metaphysical spec-
ulation, as well as from his praise of the life of altruistic
service of mankind as a substitute for religion and all other
transcendental values and interests. Thus in the end Rig-
nano follows what he thinks are the dictates of reason, and
holds that the sway of mechanism is absolute in the uni-
verse.
4. Cultural Pluralism
For many years students of human culture and history
have simply assumed that cultural evolution has been
linear and single. Let us call this view cultural monism, a
popular exposition of which will be found in James Harvey
Robinson's The Mind in the Making, as well as in a num-
ber of other popular books of recent years. In technical
form cultural monism was defended in the philosophy of
history of the Hegelian School, and it is the part of Hegel-
ianism which the pragmatists have never questioned. In
* Eugenio Rignano: The Psychology of Reasoning, p. 392. Translated by
Winifred A. Holt and published by Harcourt, Brace & Co. See also his
Nature of Life, translated by N. Mallinson.
fact cultural monism is the basic dogma of pragmatism.
It was also strongly supported by evolutionists like Her-
bert Spencer and by the positivists, following Auguste
Comte's famous law of the three stages.6 According to cul-
tural monism, Greek culture was absorbed by Roman, and
Modern European culture absorbed the Graeco-Roman,
along with Hebraic-Christian and Arabian elements. The
whole evolution of history has been a single temporal pro-
cess in which each succeeding culture absorbed that which
preceded it. No dogma was ever more deeply rooted as a
basic part of culture than the dogma of cultural monism
has been in the culture of the western world during the past
half century.
For anyone to call this strongly entrenched dogma into
question, and to brand it with epithets that belittle it, would
not have been thought conceivable twenty years ago. And
yet before and during the World War a young German
scholar was actually engaged in the Herculean task of mar-
shaling all possible evidence against it. Branding this cur-
rent dogma "the Ptolemaic theory of history," Oswald
Spengler set up, in his monumental Decline of the West,
the opposing thesis of cultural pluralism, calling it "the
Copernican theory of history." He argued that cultural
monism is based upon a false analogy. If we study organic
evolution as it is exhibited in the plant and animal world
we find everywhere that there are many separate lines of
evolution, and that each goes through definite stages of
birth, youth, maturity, and senescence. We may observe this
fact among species as well as among individual organisms.
Nature does not reveal a single linear evolution for plants
and animals. Yet cultural monism assumes that such an evo-
lution is a scientific fact so far as human culture is con-
cerned. This is a false analogy. The true inference is that
0 See the second selection from Hegel, and the first selection from Comte,
in my Anthology of Modern Philosophy for classic statements of cultural
monism.
OTHER TYPES
human cultures, like animal species and individual organ-
isms, are genuinely temporal realities which rise, flourish
and pass away. Instead of human history constituting a
single evolutionary process, culminating in modern West
European culture, we must recognize that there have been
several great cultures in the world, and that the stages of
our West European culture can be compared with the stages
in these other cultures. Spengler calls such a study the com-
parative morphology of world history.
When this comparison is made, Spengler thinks that one
at once discovers that West European culture is in the stage
of old-age. He gives it only three or four more centuries of
life and these centuries will be marked by a rapid decline
and disintegration. In proof of this Spengler cites the simi-
larities between West European culture and the classical
culture at the period when that culture declined and dis-
integrated. One of these similarities is the concentration
of life in a few great world cities, and the draining of the
energies of the country-side into these cities. When this
happens a culture has become a civilization, and that means
that it is on the decline. Another group of similarities be-
tween West European culture and classical culture is that
each aspect of our culture—art, science, religion, and phi-
losophy—is now in the stage in which these same aspects
of culture were during the last years of classical culture.
Spengler goes into great detail to indicate these similari-
ties. He especially points out the difference between the
great modern philosophers who constructed the important
systems of philosophy when West European culture was at
its height, and the puny pygmies who are philosophers to-
day. He concludes that our culture is incapable of produc-
ing any great system of philosophy, or any great art, and
that our science will become more and more an applied
science in which knowledge will be used to exploit nature.
All that is left for contemporary philosophers to do is to
work out a consistent type of scepticism.
Spengler's cultural pluralism has aroused a storm of
criticism from the defenders of cultural monism, and the
staunch believers in the ideals of internationalism. Yet
no philosophical conception of the 20th century has been
more widely disseminated. Thousands upon thousands of
Spengler's two massive volumes have been sold since the
work, first appeared in 1918, and a voluminous Spenglerian
literature has been produced. What the ultimate outcome
of the controversy between cultural monism and cultural
pluralism will be no one can predict. Spengler has at least
set the modern world to thinking.
5. Spiritual Realism
There are several contemporary philosophers who have
attempted to develop a spiritual interpretation of reality
that is genuinely realistic. These thinkers are theistic in
that they assert the reality of God. But they are also plu-
ralistic in that they hold to the relatively independent
reality of human souls. And they are realistic in that they
insist that the objective reality dealt with by science is con-
stituted out of elements that are relatively independent
reals. The chief representatives of spiritual realism are the
neo-scholastic philosophers. Their philosophy is often called
The New Thomism, after St. Thomas Aquinas, whose phi-
losophy has long been recognized as the official philosophy
of the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Leo XIII, in a
famous Encyclical, gave Roman Catholic thinkers permis-
sion to modernize the system of St. Thomas by incorporat-
ing into it as many of the new scientific ideas as could be
made consistent with the basic principles of Thomism.
Since Thomism is itself a re-interpretation of Aristotel-
ianism, the New Thomism continues the Aristotelian type
of philosophy. Another name for this philosophy is Neo-
Scholasticism. It has numerous vigorous defenders in this
country and in Europe, and publishes important philosoph-
ical journals.
OTHER TYPES
Spiritual realism, however, is not confined to the neo-
scholastic philosophers. Aliotta, De Sarlo, Martinetti, and
Varisco are not orthodox scholastics, but they have devel-
oped a spiritual realism in Italy which stands in rather
sharp opposition to the neo-idealism of Croce and Gentile.
And there are important Protestant thinkers who would
not object to being called spiritual realists, so much are
they opposed to the current types of idealism.6

TYPES PREDOMINANTLY PRAGMATIC
I. FlCTIONALISM
WHEN Josiah Royce was studying in Germany he
met a young privatdocent whom he describes in an
interesting paragraph of his exposition of the philosophy of
Kant. "The Kant devotee never knows when to stop. When
I studied in Germany as a young college graduate, some
fifteen years ago, it was my fortune to meet one of the
most learned and many-sided of the new philosophical doc-
tors of the day, who was just then preparing for a docent-
ship. He was a man who promised, as one might say, almost
everything; who wrote and published essays of remarkable
breadth and skill, and who was especially noticeable for his
wide range of work. Some years later, it unhappily occurred
to him to begin printing a commentary on Kant's "Critique
of Pure Reason." He planned the commentary for com-
pletion in four volumes octavo. Of these four he published,
not long afterwards, the first, a volume of several hundred
large pages, wherein he deals—with Kant's introductory
chapter. Since then my former acquaintance is lost. The
final volumes of the commentary have never appeared,
although he has now been at work upon them more than
ten years. How many volumes will really be needed to com-
plete the task, only the 'destroyer of delights and termi-
nator of felicities,' whom the Arabian Nights' tales always
love to mention as they close, to wit, Death himself, can
ever determine." 1 Royce does not name this remarkable

OTHER TYPES
scholar, but his description exactly fits a man who is today
recognized as one of the world's most distinguished living
philosophers, Hans Vaihinger. For he began his career as
an ardent admirer and disciple of Kant, planned to write
a complete commentary on Kant, the first volume of which
appeared in 1884 and the second in 1892, and then founded
the Kantstudien, a philosophical journal devoted to the
Kantian philosophy.
Vaihinger's profound knowledge of Kantian literature
fructified in his monumental work, The Philosophy of As If,
which went through several editions in German before it
was translated into English by C. K. Ogden. In this work
Vaihinger develops a theory, based upon various passages
of Kant's writings, that all scientific, religious, ethical, and
metaphysical concepts, in fact, all concepts whatsoever, are
fictions which have value but which lack absolute truth.
Hence his philosophy has come to be known as fictionalism.
He traces the history of the doctrine, showing that William
of Occam was the first thinker to give an exposition of the
fictional nature of general ideas and to stress the practical
necessity of ficla, as the scholastics called them. And he
points out that Hobbes, Leibniz, Condillac, and Wolff were
modern precursors of Kant in the development of fiction-
alism. But he also traces the doctrine back to the Greeks,
and he shows how it was developed after Kant by Her-
bart, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and others.
Vaihinger is a great admirer of Schopenhauer and of
von Hartmann, and accepts pessimism as the best phi-
losophy of life. In justification of this he refers to Kant's
theory that there is a radical evil in human nature, and he
calls attention to von Hartmann's having called Kant "the
father of pessimism." Vaihinger thinks that pessimism in
no way weakens biological and moral energy. On the con-
trary it makes one fight all the harder for himself, and it
also makes him eager to serve others and to relieve their
distresses. Then, too, it makes one less subjective and more
objective in his general attitude. Vaihinger's fictionalism is
thus closely allied to the irrationalism and pessimism of
Schopenhauer.
In the course of his exposition of the theory Vaihinger
makes a detailed classification of all the different types of
fictions. At first he thought of fictionalism only as a method,
and he merely collected cases of fictions which are of
special value in various fields of knowledge. Then he
came to see the metaphysical side of fictionalism, and the
view developed into a "universal system of philosophy,"
which Vaihinger called Idealistic Positivism, because he
thought that it was a just compromise between the prevail-
ing idealism of German philosophy and the positivism de-
veloped by Laas. He summarizes the doctrine under fifteen
headings. The more important of these are: (i) the irra-
tionality existing between the two spheres of physics and
psychology; (ii) voluntarism or the insistence that the
primal reality is striving and willing; (iii) the complete
subordination of all thinking to the will to live; (iv) the
notion that the importance of the conceptual world con-
structed by thought is due entirely to its fictional character,
since it constitutes a world of values in which we may take
refuge from the world of change and becoming; and (v)
the fact that the world as a whole is meaningless and that
"a mind sublime puts greatness into life, yet seeks it not
therein" (Schiller).
Vaihinger makes a great deal of what he calls the law
of the preponderance of the means over the end. He thinks
that it is a general tendency for whatever is a means to
some end to get the upper hand and to become an end in
itself. Thought is really only a means by which we adapt
ourselves to the environment and satisfy our biological
needs. Yet thought gets divorced from its function and is
made an end in itself. Then it sets up problems of all kinds
that are absolutely insoluble. Such questions are endless
and senseless. All that we can do is to explain how they
OTHER TYPES
arose psychologically. When we try to answer them we are
led into bypaths. "In this light many thought-processes and
thought-constructs appear to be consciously false assump-
tions, which either contradict reality, or are even contra-
dictory in themselves, but which are intentionally thus
formed in order to overcome difficulties of thought by this
artificial deviation and reach the goal of thought by round-
about ways and bypaths."
Vaihinger discusses the relation of fictionalism to prag-
matism and denies that they are identical. The principle of
pragmatism is that ideas which are useful in practice are
necessarily true, or that "the fruitful is thus always true."
But the principle of fictionalism is that ideas which are
known to lack truth may nevertheless possess a high degree
of utility. However, Vaihinger admits that in practice
fictionalism and pragmatism have much in common. Cer-
tainly all pragmatists would accept his law of the prepon-
derance of the means over the end, as well as many other
of his doctrines. M. C. Otto speaks of the "striking
affinities" between pragmatism and fictionalism, and ex-
presses regret that American pragmatists have not received
Vaihinger's book more warmly. He writes: "The reception
of Vaihinger's work by the American pragmatists has
scarcely been hearty. He, on his side, seemed anxious (in
the Preface written nearly a generation after the comple-
tion of the book) to avoid being classed with the pragma-
tists. In a letter to the writer in the spring of 1925,
Vaihinger explains that his objections were not aimed at
James, Dewey, or any form of 'critical Pragmatism', but
at the 'uncritical Pragmatism' which ignorantly distorts
and exaggerates what is valuable in this philosophy. This
regrettable failure in mutual acquaintance and understand-
ing is well considered in James Gutmann's recent review of
Vaihinger's Book (Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XXIII,
pp. 77-80). I think with him that 'there seems to be here
an interesting and unconsidered instance of a significant
community of thought.' And I hope with him that it may
be replaced by 'an international comparing of notes.' " 2
And the fact that both factionalism and pragmatism rest
back upon similar Kantian ideas is evidence in favor of
Otto's position.
2. Imaginism
A few contemporary thinkers, foremost among whom is
Douglas Fawcett, defend a philosophy which they call
imaginism. Fawcett invented this term. In The World as
Imagination and Divine Imagining (Macmillan & Co.),
as well as in his essay entitled Imaginism in the second
series of Contemporary British Philosophy, he has given
a complete exposition of the doctrine, discussing its rela-
tion to other views and indicating the ways in which it
solves special problems.
Imaginism is based upon an interesting passage from
Kant. "We have to inquire whether imagination combined
with consciousness may not be the same thing as memory,
wit, power of discrimination, and perhaps even identical
with understanding and Reason. Though logic is not capable
of deciding whether a fundamental power actually exists,
the idea of such a power is the problem involved in a sys-
tematic representation of such a multiplicity of powers."
(Cited in Norman Kemp Smith's Commentary, p. 474).
But Kant never developed this pregnant suggestion. Fichte
showed the connection between productive imagination and
constructed nature, thus giving the principle of imagina-
tion cosmic standing. Froschammer recognized that Phan-
tasie is a universal force permeating all nature, but neither
Fichte nor Froschammer made imagination the sole crea-
tive, all-inclusive, all-explanatory principle of reality. This
Fawcett claims to have been the first to do. And he was
led to this view because of his dissatisfaction with the
2 M. C. Otto in Philosophy Today, edited by E. L. Schaub, p. 43 (note),

OTHER TYPES
rationalistic principle of Hegel and the British Neo-
Hegelians.
"Do we desire now to escape (a) from the concept of
the block-universe which still holds the field, and (b) from
the further concept which identifies this block-universe with
Reason? We can do so by supposing that the world-prin-
ciple is (a) at once conservative and creative, and (b) that
it resembles, at a distance, what is conscired as pure im-
agining in ourselves. I say 'pure' imagining, since imaginal
constructs which are used to represent other reality, which
are thus under the control of this 'other', have become, in
virtue of their function, portions of instrumental conceptual
thought. They belong thereby to the story of reason which
opens in connexion with the needs of finite sentiments
adjusting themselves tentatively to surroundings in a divided
world." 8
Fawcett is careful to distinguish imagination in this
broad sense from imagining narrowly so-called, which is
merely one of the phases of the deeper imagining. Of the
two aspects of cosmic imagining—the conservative and the
creative—the latter is much more fundamental. "Conserva-
tion implies sustaining activity; to be is to be created or
create or both." And this creative force of cosmic imagin-
ing is identical with time and includes duration, simultane-
ity, and succession. Moreover, it is conscious. In its active
self-conscious aspect imagining is consciring. This is a tech-
nical term invented by Fawcett to name the conscious crea-
tivity of the cosmic imagining. He says that it is identical
with Fichte's "infinite activity," thought of as being aware
of its own contents.
Consciring, however, is not rational or intellectual activ-
ity. Truth is relational and is at a lower level. Thinking is
purely instrumental. On this point James and Dewey and
Schiller are right. Concepts and scientific laws are mere

truth-shadows, whereas the reality with which consciring is
identical is wider and more real than truth. Thought only
takes place in finite centres. Rignano is right in holding this
theory. All thinking arises out of the necessity of an organ-
ism facing an obdurate environment and it shares the fini-
tude of the organism. But divine imagining rises above
truth and thought and includes all reality and all unreality.
Just as James treated pragmatism as an adequate synthesis
of empiricism and idealism, so Fawcett treats imaginism as
such a synthesis. It excludes the subjective forms of ideal-
ism and the irrational and positivistic forms of realism.
Hence it is at one and the same time the true idealism and
the true realism. And although imaginism has not yet
worked out a satisfactory solution of the problem of im-
mortality, it fully recognizes that a philosophy which can-
not solve this problem, and offer to men a reasonable assur-
ance of future existence, is in the end worthless.
3. Pancalism
A distinguished American scholar, J. M. Baldwin, editor
of the Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, has de-
veloped a view which he calls pancalism, which is similar
to Fawcett's imaginism. The origin of the term pancalism
is interesting. Baldwin wrote a three volume work entitled
Thought and Things or Genetic Logic, Vol. Ill of which
was devoted to Real Logic, Part I, Interest and Art. He
has never published the remainder of Real Logic but he
followed this third volume with an independent work, en-
titled Genetic Theory of Reality. He adopted as the motto
for his Genetic Logic the Greek phrase rd Ka\bv itav, which
means literally the beautiful is all. But at the end of Volume
III of that work he reached the conclusion that this motto
accurately expresses the nature of all reality. Hence he
turned the phrase into the term pancalism as a name for
his philosophy. He explains in the Preface of Vol. Ill how
he formed the word and gives in a footnote a Greek
OTHER TYPES
scholar's justification of the formation, which is a little
irregular, although there is a Greek word *&vKa\os.
Aesthetic immediatism is another name Baldwin uses for
his philosophy. He holds that aesthetic experience is the
highest form that knowledge can take, for the reason that
it reconciles the opposition between truth and utility or
practicality. The aesthetic whole conserves both truth and
utility. "All the judgments of truth and value which the
prosaic actualities permit are reconstituted in the aesthetic
judgment: valid relations are depicted; moral predicates
are reinstated; ideal suggestions are enforced; common
acceptance is enjoined in the synnomic values of the art
work." (Vol. Ill, p. 254.) But "aesthetic experience pre-
sents the profounder significance of which truth and utility
are partial and immature factors." And further on he
adds: "The theory which . . . issues in the reasoned view
that in aesthetic contemplation we have the fullest revela-
tion of what reality means, I shall venture to call Pancal-
ism, rendering in a single term—which has analogies of
derivation in the terms Pantheism, Panpsychism, etc.—the
meaning of the motto affixed to the first volume of this
treatise, t<J ko.\6v *av" (p. 257). This theory is elaborated
more at length in Part IV of a Genetic Theory of Reality,
but we cannot here enter into the more detailed exposition.
Baldwin recognizes the kinship between his philosophy
and pragmatism. In an essay entitled Aspects of Contem-
porary Thought, contributed to the American Year Book
for 1910, and republished as Appendix C to Vol. Ill of
Genetic Logic, he discusses this relationship. He accepts
the word instrumentalism as the right term to use, if we
want to stress the similarity between his view and pragma-
tism. For he agrees with the pragmatists in their polemic
against idealism, in their theory that all knowledge is ex-
perimental in character, that ideas are instruments of
action, that thought is an organism and a growing system
that is essentially social in character. What he objects to
in pragmatism is its failure to make meaning an intrinsic
value and a part of reality itself. Pragmatism stresses one
side of human experience and neglects others, and it is espe-
cially weak in its aesthetic theory. Yet Creighton is un-
doubtedly right in saying: "Though there are some impor-
tant differences between Professor Baldwin's views and
those of the pragmatic evolutionists, they belong together
in general standpoint and aim. Not only do they both ap-
proach the problem of logic from the psychological point
of view, but both alike derive their working conceptions
from the biological formulation of evolution rather than
from post-Kantian idealism." 4
4. Religious Pragmatism
In a thesis for the doctor's degree at the Sorbonne in
1893, entitled L'Action, Maurice Blondel, a young Roman
Catholic philosopher, and one of the founders of Catholic
Modernism in France, argued that the will and the total
active side of life is fundamental in determining what we
accept as true. And in a letter which was published in 1902,
in the Revue du Clerge Francais, Blondel suggested that the
name pragmatism was an exact description of his doctrine,
and said that he had been using the term for a decade or
more. But when the word pragmatism came to be used
as the name for the new Anglo-American philosophy of
Schiller, James, and Dewey, Blondel ceased to use the term
because of the basic differences between his doctrine and
theirs. However, as Caldwell and others have pointed out,
there is much in common between the doctrines of the
French modernists and the interpretation of religion of
the pragmatists of England and America. Voluntarism, or
the making of the will to believe fundamental to religious
truth, is the chief.point of agreement. But this voluntarism
expresses itself in a pronounced anti-intellectualism in
Blondel and his followers, who even attack Neo-Scholas-
* Psychological Review, Vol. XVI, p. 179.
OTHER TYPES
ticism for its excessive reliance upon human reason, and
this is another point of agreement. The French religious
pragmatists, however, differ from the Anglo-American
pragmatists in defending tradition as necessary, and as a
creative force which keeps alive the unconscious, but vital,
beliefs of the past. The French thinkers especially stress
the notion of the immanence of God. And the experience
of God is not an outer experience but comes to man through
the activity of his entire inner life. In this respect they hold
a view which is quite similar to the activism of Eucken.
fidouard Le Roy has developed French religious prag-
matism more fully than Blondel by combining it with the
philosophy of Bergson. He denies that scientific knowledge
is legitimate and treats scientific laws and facts as mere
conventions and instruments of practical life. Philosophy,
on the other hand, is concerned with the living spirit of
man. Proofs of God's existence and the attempt to compre-
hend God intellectually are utterly worthless, and even sin-
fully presumptuous. Yet we know God through prayer,
which renews the spirit and makes life an ever new creative
process.
Le Roy uses the word pragmatism in an entirely different
sense from the Anglo-American pragmatists. He does not
identify truth with utility, but thinks that the fecundity
of an idea is a sign or criterion of its truth. He insists that
the verification of an idea should always be a deed and not
simply an argument. "The supreme criterion is success:
thought is satisfied whenever it springs from a very strong,
rich, and luminous experimental test. In a word, verification
is a sort of crisis in the growth of thought." 6
5. Scientific Pragmatism
Somewhat like Le Roy in his philosophy of science,
although entirely independent and original in his viewpoint,
8 fi. Le Roy in A. Lalande's Vocabulaire de la philosophie, 2nd ed., Vol. II,
p. 612. My translation.
rraa is Henri Poincare, the distinguished French mathematician,
idi rtr who turned philosopher and made important contributions
Iodic to the philosophy of science. In La Valeur de la science he
f, 2si: distinguishes two components in the empirical laws of
i,kc science: (i) a convention that is neither true nor false but
iilVr that is simply laid down as a definition, and (ii) the law
njc itself, which serves as a basis for a prediction about future
isfc events. Poincare holds that the conceptual symbols used to
tier: express laws are often purely fictitious, and that whole sys-
Eue terns of natural law may be suspended and be replaced by
obe other systems. Hence science is relative to man, although
»t: it is not purely artificial but rather the result of social agree-
fgrtt ment. But Poincare does not identify the truth of science
jj2 with its practical utility, nor does he treat one science, say
jgjp mathematics, as merely a servant of another, say physics.
mj The value of a science is to be determined by its spiritual up-
lift rather than by its mere utility. Hence Poincare opposes
res Le Roy's reduction of science to the value that it has in
p> meeting the needs of action. Science has an objective char-
acter which Le Roy denies to it. Underneath all the fictional
character of our conceptual symbols there is the World-
.> Harmony—the total, unified whole of reality. And the sci-
e, entist who can feel this deeper harmony of nature can con-
quer selfishness, and cooperate with other scientists in that
prolonged effort to attain the truth, which is the essence of
i. the scientific spirit. This feeling is, for Poincare, the basis
of ethics, and the principles follow that "there can be no
r). scientific Ethics" and "there can be no unethical science."
Other representatives of scientific pragmatism, who dif-
fer somewhat from Poincare and from each other, are
Karl Pearson, who set forth this theory in The Grammar
of Science, and F. Enriques, the distinguished Italian phi-
losopher, who has developed interesting logical theories
and a unique philosophy of science.
THE TRUE PHILOSOPHY
i. Analysis op the Problem
IN expounding the three chief types of contemporary
philosophy the author sided with the idealists because
he believes that they have a better method of philosophiz-
ing, and a more satisfactory general basic principle than
any of the others. But in concluding the discussion it seems
essential to bring this assumption up for stricter examina-
tion and closer scrutiny. For all of those who have read
thus far in this book must be genuinely interested in the
all-important question: What is the true philosophy? Let
us, then, try to lay away every prejudice in favor of one
type or another, and abandon entirely the controversial
attitude which characterizes him who takes sides. Let us
make a final attempt to take the purely objective attitude
of the real philosopher and the earnest seeker after the
dizzy utmost of philosophic truth. And in this calm but
impassioned attitude of the honest truth-seeker, let us face
the question: What, after all, is the true philosophy?
When we face this question impartially and fairly we
find that it may be approached from two different direc-
tions. One of these directions is relative and the other is
absolute. But the relative approach will differ according to
the viewpoint from which we construct our philosophy.
What is the true philosophy for me as an individual
thinker, faced with the particular problems of my personal
life? This is the form the question takes for every reflective
person. A man's personal philosophy .of liff^as G. K. Ches-
terton and William James rightly emphasized, is the most
354
355
fundamental thin^ in him,. In James's words, it is his "more
or less dumb sense of what life honestly and deeply means,"
it is his "individual way of just seeing and feeling the total
push anoT pressure of the cosmos." Let each individual
"reader of this book seriously raise for himself the question:
What is my philosophy of life? What philosophy is true
for me? Now, when the question is raised in this personal
form, it at once becomes clear that the answer to it cannot
be that worked out by some other person, for example, by
the author of this book. For each thinker must .ultimately
answer that question by thinking out his philosophy for
himselfL Hence the author's favoring idealism cannot and
ought not to determine the answer which each reader gives
to the personal form of the question: What is the true phi-
losophy? And it goes without saying that no other philoso-
pher's favoring any other type should determine that
answer.
What is the true philosophy for America, or England,
or France, or Germany, or Italy, or Russia, or China, or
India? Born a citizen of a great national culture, every indi-
vidual who is at all reflective must be deeply interested
in finding out what is the true philosophy for his culture,
for the people of whose deeper aspirations, hopes, convic-
tions, and prejudices he must have more sympathetic under-
standing than for those of any other people. What is the
true philosophy for the culture of which he is a part and in
whose throbbing life he participates? Is pragmatism or
realism or idealism the true philosophy of American cul-
ture? Or must we look for another, as yet unformed?
We may go farther and take the viewpoint of humanity
as a whole. We may rise to the profound insight of the
pragmatist and view all mankind as a unified totality of
intellectual and spiritual life. From this all-inclusive human
viewpoint our question becomes: What is the true philoso-
phy for this our age and for the generations of men that
are as yet unborn? What will humanity finally adopt as the
OTHER TYPES
best philosophy for all mankind? Is William James right
in thinking that "the finally victorious way of looking at
things will be the most completely impressive way to the
normal run of minds?" Or will the ultimately true philoso-
phy be like the Einstein theory of relativity, something that
only half a dozen supreme thinkers alone can understand?
When we reach this viewpoint of humanity as a whole
we are close to the absolute approach to our question. But
we have not yet reached that absolute viewpoint. Suppose
we imagine some being who is the spectator of all time and
existence; whose time-span covers all temporal reality,
all relativity time-systems; whose penetration fathoms all
mysteries, all hidden meanings; whose mind is absolutely
omniscient. For such an omniscient being what would be
the true philosophy? To put it in terms of the pregnant
phrase of Spinoza, which we have so often quoted: What
is the true philosophy to him who sees all things sub specie
aeternitatis, from the viewpoint of eternity?
Now the author believes that no individual will ever be
satisfied in his own thinking until he transcends all relative
viewpoints, and finds what he thinks is the answer to the
question from the viewpoint of absolutely perfect insight.
That is why all great philosophers have a tendency to
claim finality for their own view. That is why they all try to
show that their view is the natural outcome of the whole
history of philosophic reflection and that their system super-
sedes all other systems. That is why they tend to treat the
views of all others, past and living, as only approximations
to the truth, while claiming an absoluteness for their own
deeper insights. All the great philosophers have what
Hocking has called "the prophetic consciousness." They
are sure, sometimes too sure, that they have the true phi-
losophy. Now it is because idealism, more than any other
philosophy, has honestly tried to take the viewpoint of
eternity that the author favors idealism. But he is well
aware of the fact that many idealists have woefully failed
357
to take that viewpoint, and that some philosophers of other
schools have succeeded in taking it.
2. Eclecticism
However, there is a way of answering the question:
What is the true philosophy? that is almost as old as phi-
losophy. It is known as the principle of eclecticism. From
the days of the Greeks to our own day there have always
been thinkers who have said: "There is truth in all of these
philosophies of my contemporaries. The only difficulty is
that each man is onesided and refuses to see what his oppo-
nents see. My philosophy will be more tolerant to all
truth. It will be constructed by picking the best from each
grj^LghiJqsophy. These truths which I take from the vari-
ous thinkers I will mould into my philosophy. And this will
give me the true philosophy." Whoever proceeds in this
fashion develops what philosophers call eclecticism.
Among contemporary philosophers a right noble repre-
sentative of this position is D. C. Macintosh. He was
trained in philosophy at the University of Chicago when
pragmatism absolutely dominated the philosophic instruc-
tion in that institution. Upon graduation he had the good
fortune to be called to Yale Divinity School as professor of
systematic theology. For many years he has ably taught
philosophy in that great institution. He is recognized to-
day as one of the most acute and astute critics of idealism
and of realism, and he has gradually separated himself from
pragmatic naturalism because of its deep-seated hostility to
religion. In feeling his way toward a philosophy that would
do justice to all viewpoints he has adopted the eclectic
method. In his Bross Prize Essay, entitled The Reasonable-
ness of Christianity, he has worked out this position in con-
siderable detail. Perhaps his view is nearer to that of the
critical realists than to any other type that we have dis-
cussed. He was originally considered a member of this
group of philosophers, but he now recognizes certain
OTHER TYPES
defects in that type of realism. So he has developed his own
position independently, calling it critical monism, and trying
to incorporate into it the best insights of all contemporary
and historic types of philosophy.1 Another eclectic philoso-
pher is G. W. T. Patrick. His Introduction to Philosophy
embodies this point of view, and largely for that reason
it has been very popular with teachers of courses in intro-
duction to philosophy.
The author does not favor eclecticism as a method of
answering the question: What is the true philosophy? He
recognizes that it has a certain value for the beginning
student, in that it prevents him from being indoctrinated
too soon with some one type, and causes him to keep an
open and tolerant mind toward all truth. But in the end
eclecticism is sure to result in an internally inconsistent
philosophy. It is really impossible to combine all of the
good points of all types of philosophy, and at the same
time to exclude from this construction all of the defects of
each. The attempt to do so is worth making, and the eclectic
philosophies of each age have undoubtedly served a useful
function. But few of them have ever succeeded in gaining a
recognition for themselves as first class philosophies. Be-
cause it refuses to adopt a definite principle of unification
for the diverse elements it selects from various thought-
systems, eclecticism stands condemned as a method.
3. A Synthesis of the Types
Another way of answering the question is to use some one
general principle to make a real synthesis of the various
types. The most persuasive recent attempt at such a syn-
thesis is to be found in W. E. Hocking's The Types of
Philosophy, Part IV. In this excellent book the author dis-
tinguishes the following historic types of philosophy, all of
which, he thinks, are to be found ably represented among
1 Professor Macintosh's views are well summarized in his essay entitled
"Experimental Realism in Religion," contributed to the volume Religious
Realism, which he edited.
359
contemporary thinkers: Naturalism, Pragmatism, Intuition-
ism, Dualism, Idealism, Realism, and Mysticism. In our
reduction of the types to three we have included Natural-
ism and Dualism under Realism and Intuitionism and Mys-
ticism under Idealism. But there is justification in Hocking's
classification, as is shown by the fact that we were forced
to distinguish different forms of realism and of idealism.
After expounding and criticising each of these seven main
types, Hocking attempts in Part IV to make his synthesis.
It consists in adopting the fundamental principle of ideal-
ism, and then of including as much of each of the other six
types as is consistent with that principle.
This suggests the chief defect in a synthesis of the types.
It inevitably becomes the type accepted by the philosopher
who makes the synthesis. A realist would certainly make an
entirely different synthesis from an idealist, and a prag-
matist still another. As a matter of fact every great philoso-
pher looks upon his own philosophy as the true synthesis of
the types. Yet there is great value in Hocking's method,
which makes it superior to eclecticism. And that value is that
it adopts some one principle of unification. If it were pos-
sible to get philosophers to agree on a set of postulates of
the whole philosophic enterprise, we might be able to create
a body of philosophical knowledge which every philosopher,
regardless of the type he represented, would be willing to
accept. We dealt with Hocking's own statement of these
postulates in Part I, Chapter IV, and accepted them as
essential to philosophy. Yet we there acknowledged that
they were the set formulated by an idealist, and that they
were prejudiced in the direction of idealism. Is it possible
to make an analysis of the general structure of philosophy
on which all philosophers will agree? Probably not, but let
us consider the metaphysical triangle that is naturally sug-
gested by the three types of contemporary philosophy, to
see whether it will aid us in answering the question: What
is the true philosophy?
OTHER TYPES
4. The Convergence of the Types
Suppose that we think of life, and its highest develop-
ment in man, as forming one base angle of the triangle;
of physical nature and its constituents as the opposite base
angle; and of God or the Absolute as the apex. At the
very beginning of modern philosophy, and under the direct
influence of the mechanistic science which was founded by
Galileo, three great philosophers developed their respec-
tive philosophies by starting from different angles of this
metaphysical triangle. Thomas Hobbes was a materialist
and as such he argued that nothing is real but bodies
and their motions. Thus he started from the physical nature
base angle, and elaborated his philosophy from that start-
ing point. He is the progenitor of all forms of modern
materialism. Rene Descartes started at the other base angle,
and elaborated his philosophy from that point, which he
thought was the only absolute certainty, and which he ex-
pressed in his famous maxim: Cogito, ergo sum—I think,
therefore I am (or exist). He was forced to recognize
nature as an independent reality, and he thus became a
dualist and the progenitor of all forms of modern dualism.
Baruch de Spinoza started at the apex of the triangle and
defined God or Substance as that which exists by itself and
can be conceived by itself. From this definition of God
he derived his famous absolute monism, which Leibniz
straightway transformed into spiritual pluralism. And these
two thinkers, Spinoza and Leibniz, have become the pro-
genitors of all modern idealistic monisms and pluralisms.2
In contemporary philosophy this triangle is still in opera-
tion. The new realists derive their philosophy from the
physical nature angle of the triangle. They have greatly re-

Modern Philosophy.
361
fined the conception of physical nature. In fact they have
substituted for the old idea of matter and motion, which
dominated the thinking of Hobbes, the idea that physical
nature is an infinite set (or aggregate of sets, each of which
is infinite) of mathematical and logical relations between
events. This is the logical atomism of Russell and White-
head, and the world of neutral entities of Holt. It is the
highest culmination of monistic realism or objective rela-
tivism. The critical realists have asserted the equal reality
of both base angles of the triangle. Life and mind are
real—just as real as physical nature. They have emerged
out of physical nature and are really higher than that out
of which they have emerged, because of their greater com-
plexity and intricacy. Nevertheless, physical nature preceded
them and will be here when they are gone. Thus critical
realism will be forced to go over to the position of the new
realists and make physical nature the only reality, or turn
towards the other base angle of the triangle and make mind
or life ultimate. If it makes life ultimate it becomes identical
with the vitalism of Bergson. If it makes mind ultimate it
becomes identical with the humanism of pragmatism. For
both pragmatism and vitalism make life and mind their
starting point, and develop a metaphysics which subordi-
nates physical nature to life and mind.
Idealism is the only type of contemporary philosophy,
except Scholasticism and some forms of Eclecticism, which
makes God or the Absolute the starting point of philoso-
phy, and which defines experience as inclusive of the whole
intelligible order of the universe. It does not reach God, or
the Absolute, at the end of a series of steps of reasoning.
It begins with the fact of God as revealed in experience,
and builds its philosophy of the universe on that fact, just
as pragmatism begins with the fact of social solidarity and
realism with the fact of "an ether of events," and build
their respective metaphysics thereon. Hence the ultimate
question for the student who would formulate his own phi-
OTHER TYPES
losophy of life is: Which corner of the metaphysical tri-
angle shall I make my starting point?
Now, when we raise the question in this form, it is easy
to see that a synthesis of the types can be made by starting
from any corner of the triangle. Hocking's and Royce's syn-
theses start with God and interpret the whole triangular
universe of reality in terms of God. Starting from the same
angle, Bosanquet, Bradley, and other absolutists posit an
impersonal and logical intelligence, and interpret the whole
of reality as the manifestation of the workings of this intel-
ligence. Hocking's Meaning of God in Human Experience,
the Gifford Lectures of Royce and Bosanquet, and Brad-
ley's Appearance and Reality all aim to show how impos-
sible it is to understand any form of human experience
unless we treat all these forms as expressions of God or the
Absolute, manifesting Himself or itself in finite existence.
Realists have made syntheses which start from the nature
angle of the triangle, and interpret God and man in terms
of logical essences and of the ether of events. Samuel Alex-
ander's Space, Time and Deity, Whitehead's Process and
Reality and Santayana's Realms of Being (of which only
two volumes have appeared) are excellent examples of real-
istic syntheses. Dewey and Bergson start from the life
angle: Dewey, in his greatest book—Experience and Na-
ture, interprets it merely from the human viewpoint, while
Bergson, in Creative Evolution, interprets it in terms of all
life, including the human as the highest form of the living.
But what everyone wants to know is: Which synthesis is the
right one? What, after all is said and done, is the true
philosophy?
It seems obvious, at least to the author, that none of
these syntheses gives the real answer to this question. And
yet it is also equally obvious that in such works as those we
have just cited, and a few others that we have not here
mentioned, one comes as near to an answer as it is possible
to corne at the present stage of our knowledge. Certainly
363
these writings embody the deepest and profoundest philo-
sophical wisdom of our age. Yet none of these thinkers
wholly succeeds in viewing the world sub specie aeternitatis.
Even these greatest writings of contemporary philosophical
literature are infected with human frailities, and they show
at various points the limitations inherent in all finite
accounts of what reality is.
Let us consider our metaphysical triangle as the base of a
crystal pyramid. Let us imagine an omniscient mind looking
down from the apex into the depths of the crystal. If
we could be where we have supposed that being to be we
would know what God and man is. But we must say to
that being:
Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
Is a world of sweets and sours;
Our flowers are merely—flowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
Is the sunshine of ours.
And yet we also dare say:
If I could dwell
Where Israfel
Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
From my lyre within the sky.3
Is it possible, while a denizen of time, to see the universe
from the viewpoint of the denizens of eternity? Certain
supremely great philosophers have made this attempt, and
to them we owe the richest treasures of our philosophical
literature. And the author believes that those philosophers
who succeed in throwing off the Zeitgeist or spirit of the
age, who get a perspective on the various scientific concepts
3 These lines are from Edgar Allan Poe's poem, Israfel, which was
inspired by the following verse from the Koran: "And the angel, Israfel,
whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the sweetest voice of all God's
creatures."
OTHER TYPES
and social institutions of their own day and of other days,
who can see where the extremes of philosophical positions
meet, and where the streams of thought embodied in each
type of philosophy converge to make the whole ocean of
philosophic truth, are the supremely great philosophers.
But whether our age has any such philosophers cannot be
determined by one who stands where we stand. As time
passes a new system of philosophy will arise. It will be
fed by the streams of our contemporary thought. And it
will embody higher truth than any of our present-day phi-
losophies. That system of philosophy towards which all our
contemporary types are converging will not be identical
with any of them, because it will contain only what is dur-
able and eternal in the thought of our age. But that new
system which is now in the making is the answer to our
question. It is the true philosophy.
SUGGESTED SUPPLEMENTARY WORK
1. In studying philosophy it is essential to go to the
original sources. My Anthology of Recent Philosophy
(Crowell) contains sixty-eight selections from sixty-five
philosophers of the twentieth century, and my Anthology
of Modern Philosophy (Crowell) contains ninety-seven
selections from thirty-two of the great philosophers who
lived between 1600 and 1900. An analysis precedes each
selection and biographical sketches and bibliographies will
be found in the Appendix of each volume. Students will get
a much better knowledge of living philosophy by supple-
menting each chapter of this book with a reading of one
or more of the selections in these two anthologies. Benja-
min Rand's Modern Classical Philosophers (Houghton
Mifflin Co.) and A. E. Avey Readings in Philosophy
(Appleton) also contain excellent supplementary material.
2. J. H. Muirhead is the editor of two volumes entitled
Contemporary British Philosophy, and G. P. Adams and
W. P. Montague are the editors of two volumes entitled
Contemporary American Philosophy. The latter was spon-
sored by the American Philosophical Association. These
four volumes contain personal statements of their phi-
losophy by sixty-two of the leading British and American
philosophers and the books should be in every public library.
A biography, and a bibliography of each man's chief writ-
ings, accompanies each personal statement. These philoso-
phers are classified below under the types discussed in this
book. The letter B is an abbreviation for the British series,
and the letter A for the American series. The Roman nu-
merals indicate the volume. Let each student select one rep-
resentative of each type and write an exposition of that
man's philosophy, based upon a reading of his personal
367
statement and of something else that he wrote. The teacher
should supplement this list by adding the names of other
representative philosophers, and especially those of other
lands. The volumes in the Library of Contemporary
Thought, edited by W. Tudor Jones (Knopf), will be
found most useful, and should also be in every public library.

3. For several years I have obtained excellent results
by requiring my students to write an essay on the subject
"My Philosophy of Life" at the end of their course in
philosophy. Where there is a philosophy prize available,
as there should be in every college and university, it may
well be awarded to the student writing the best essay on
this subject. Following are the instructions which I have
used in making this assignment to my own students. It may
be of interest to some to learn that this was used as one
of the examinations given in the final elimination of
senior contestants from Indiana high schools for the
Edison scholarship.
Instructions for an Essay on "My Philosophy of Life"
a. Read carefully the following statements:
"There are some people—and I am one of them—who
think that the most practical and important thing about a
man is still his view of the universe. We think that for a
landlady considering a lodger it is important to know his
income, but still more important to know his philosophy.
We think that for a general about to fight an enemy, it is
important to know the enemy's numbers, but still more
important to know the enemy's philosophy." G. K. Chester-
ton in Heretics (Preface).
"I think with Mr. Chesterton in this matter. I know that
you, ladies and gentlemen, have a philosophy, each and all
of you, and that the most interesting thing about you is
the way in which it determines the perspective in your sev-
eral worlds. You know the same of me. . . . The philoso-
phy which is so important in each of us is not a technical
matter; it is our more or less dumb sense of what life
honestly and deeply means." William James in Pragma-
tism (Longmans), page 3.
"At adolescence there is at least one task of creation
which the will cannot escape, that of constructing one's
philosophy. The youth finds himself, at his own estimate,
for the first time an equal among equals. There is a change
in the order of authority ... a sense of competence and
a disposition to be critical. The conceit of opinion in the
adolescent is not empty; it is based on a readiness to assume
responsibility, and on an actual assumption of responsibility
in the work of mental world-building. . . . He appreciates
for the first time that he has his own life to lead; he finds
himself morally alone; he can no longer endure to see
through the eyes of others." W. E. Hocking, Human
Nature and Its Remaking, 2nd ed. (Yale Press), page
273. See also W. D. Hyde: Five Great Philosophies of
Life.
b. Make your discussion as sincere as possible, and
original in the sense that it reflects your own outlook on
life. Do not be afraid of saying exactly what you think.
c. Describe any experience of your own in which you
assumed responsibility for your own choice and first began
to see things through your own eyes. Do you think that this
experience was the beginning of your philosophy of life, as
Hocking suggests?
d. State briefly what you regard as the essential ideas
of your own philosophy of life—your ideas of right and
wrong, happiness, God, immortality, the social order, inter-
nationalism, education, marriage, science, art, etc.
e. State what you think have been the chief sources of
the ideas making up your philosophy of life. For example,
parents, teachers, preachers or priests or rabbis, schools,
religious organizations, patriotic organizations, books, etc.
What philosophers have most influenced you in this course?
f. You may write in the third person, or you may make
your essay autobiographical, or*,you may use any literary
form you like. Quote poetry or other material, if it ex-
presses your ideas, but give the exact reference in each case
in a footnote.
g. Your essay should be between 2500 and 5000 words
in length. It should be as serious and as solid a piece of
writing as you are capable of doing, and something you
will take pride in keeping to read over in later years. It
need not be typewritten, but it should be clearly written,
with ample margins for comments. The essay is due one
week before final examinations begin.
4. After each part of this book is completed it will be
found a good plan, if the class or quiz section is small
enough to make it feasible, to divide the students into dis-
cussion groups. Let one group criticise and the other de-
fend the type of philosophy under consideration in a dis-
cussion contest or debate. This is sure to stir up a great
deal of interest, if capable leaders are selected for each
group.
5. Bishop Berkeley's Three Dialogues between Hylas
and Philonous, George Santayana's Dialogues in Limbo
(Charles Scribner's Sons), W. P. Montague's dialogue at
the end of The Ways of Knowing, and J. B. Pratt's Adven-
tures in Philosophy and Religion (The Macmillan Com-
pany) are excellent models of philosophical dialogues. Let
those students who are interested in so doing prepare a
short dialogue setting forth the various attitudes of the dif-
ferent types of philosophy on one or more of the great
problems, after a study of one or more of the dialogues just
mentioned. This may take the place of the more formal re-
port on one man's philosophy. It might be a cooperative
piece of work, if there are two or three fairly gifted stu-
dents who prefer to work out a dialogue together. The dia-
logue method of teaching philosophy has been used success-
fully by some teachers, and it should prove valuable with
selected groups. Any method that will encourage students
to discuss the problems together in the so-called "bull ses-
sions" which they hold outside of the classroom, should be
most helpful.
