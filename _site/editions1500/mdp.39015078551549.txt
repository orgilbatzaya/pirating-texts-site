PREFACE.
If ever the story of any private man's
adventures in the world were worth making
public, and were acceptable when published,
the editor of this account thinks this will
be so.
The wonders of this man's life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the
life of one man being scarce capable of a
greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with
seriousness, and with a religious application
of events, to the uses to which wise men
always apply them, viz. to the instruction
of others by this example, and to justify
b 2
and honour the wisdom of Providence in
all the variety of our circumstances, let them
happen how they will.
The editor believes this narrative to be
a just history of fact; neither is there any
appearance of fiction in it: and though he is
well aware there are many, who, on account
of the very singular preservations the Author
met with, will give it the name of romance;
yet, in whichever of these lights it shall be
viewed, he imagines that the improvement
of it, as well as the diversion, as to the
instruction of the reader, will be the same,
and as such he thinks, without further com-
pliment to the world, he does them great
service in the publication.
 BOUT the year 1632,1 was
born in the ancient city of
York, of respectable parents.
My father was a native of
Bremen, who, by merchan-
dizing at Hull, for some time, gained a very
plentiful fortune. He married my mother
at York, and as her maiden name was Ro-
binson, I was called Robinson Kreutznaer;
which not being easily pronounced in the
English tongue, we are commonly known
by the name of Crusoe.
b 3
I was the youngest of three brothers, and
no charge or pains were wanting in my
education. My father designed me for the
law, yet nothing would serve me but I
must go to sea, both against the will of
my father, the tears of my mother, and the
entreaties of friends. One morning my fa-
ther expostulated very warmly with me :
" What reason," says, he "have you to leave
your native country, and enter into a wander-
ing condition of uneasiness and uncertainty ?"
He recommended to me Agar's wish, ' Nei-
ther to desire poverty nor riches:' told
me that a middle state of life was the most
happy, and that high, towering thoughts of
raising our condition by wandering abroad,
often ended in confusion and disappoint-
ment. " I entreat you, nay, I command you,"
(says he), " to desist from these intentions.
" If you will go," (added he), " my prayers
shall be offered for your preservation; but
a time may come, when desolate, oppressed,
or forsaken, you may wish you had taken
your poor father's counsel." He pronounced
these words with such a moving and pater-
nal eloquence, while floods of tears ran
down his aged cheeks, that it seemed to
shake my resolutions. But this soon wore
off, and a little after I informed my mother
that I could not settle to any business; and
begged she would gain my father's consent
only to go one voyage ; which, if it did not
prove prosperous, I would never attempt a
second. My mother warmly expressed her
dislike of this proposal.
I was then, I think, nineteen years old,
when, one time being at Hull, I met a school-
fellow going with his father, who was mas-
ter of a ship, to London; and acquainting
him with my wandering desires, he assured
me of a free passage, and a plentiful share
of what was necessary. Thus, without im-
ploring a blessing, or taking farewell o/ my
parents, I took shipping on the 1st of Sep-
tember, 1651. We set sail soon after, and
our ship had scarce left the Humber v hen
there arose a violent storm, and being ex-
tremely sea-sick, I concluded the judgment
of God deservedly followed me for my dis-
obedience to my dear parents. It was then
I called to mind the good advice of my
father; and I firmly resolved, if it pleased
God to set me on dry land once more, to
return to my parents, implore their for-
giveness, and bid a final adieu to my
wandering inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while the storm
continued; but these good resolutions de-
creased with the danger; and I soon for-
got the vows and promises I made in my
distress.
Upon the sixth day we came to anchor
in Harwich road, where wre lay wind-bound
with some Newcastle ships; here the sea-
men forgot their late toil and danger, and
spent their time as merrily as if they had
been on shore. But on the eighth day
there arose a brisk gale of wind, which
prevented our tiding it up the river; and
still increasing, our ship rode forecastle in,
and shipped several large seas.
It was not long before horror seized the
seaman themselves, and I heard the master
exclaim, " Lord have mercy upon us, we
shall be all lost and undone !" For my part
sick unto death, I kept my cabin, till the
universal and terrible, dreadful apprehen-
sions of our speedy fate made me get"*3pon
deck; and there I was affrighted indeed.
The sea ran mountains high; I could see
nothing but distress around us; two ships
had cut their masts on board, and another
was foundered; two more that had lost
their anchors, were forced out to the mercy
of the ocean: and to save our lives we
were forced to cut our foremast and main-
mast quite away.
I was just ready to expire with fear,
when immediately all hands were called to
the pump; and the men forced me also to
share with them in their labour. While
thus employed, the master espying some
light colliers, fired a gun as a signal of
distress; and I, not understanding what it
meant, and thinking that either the ship
broke, or some dreadful thing happened,
fainted away. However, nobody minded me,
excepting to thrust me aside with their feet,
thinking me dead, and it was a great while
before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when upon the sig-
nal given, they ventured out their boats to
save our lives. All our pumping had been
in vain, had not they come to our ship's
side : with great difficulty we got into their
boat, and we perceived our ship sink within
less than a quarter of an hour.
Strange, after all this, like the prodigal
son, I did not return to my father; who,
hearing of the ship's calamity, for a long
time thought me entombed in the deep.
I thought at first I would return home ;
but shame opposed that good notion, think-
ing I should be laughed at by my neigh-
bours and acquaintance. So strange is the
nature of youth, who are not ashamed to
sin, but yet are ashamed to repent, and re-
turn to their duty, which is the principal
mark of wisdom. In short, I travelled up
to London, resolving upon a voyage ; and
a voyage I soon heard of, to go to the coast
of Guinea. Having some money, and ap-
pearing like a gentleman, 1 went on board
not as a common sailor or fore-mast man ;
nay, the commander agreed I should go
the voyage with him without any expense;
that I should be his messmate and companion,
and I was very welcome to cany anything
with me, and make the best merchandize
I could.
I blessed my happy fortune, and humbly
thanked my captain for this offer; and ac-
quainting my friends in Yorkshire, fortv
pounds were sent me, the greatest part by my
dear father and mother, with which I bought
toys and trifles as the captain directed me.
My captain also taught me navigation, how
to keep an account of the ship's course, take
an observation, and led me into the know-
ledge of several useful branches of the ma-
thematics. And indeed this voyage made me
both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought
home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust
for my adventure; which produced, at my
return to London, almost three hundred
pounds.
But alas! my dear friend, the captain,
soon departed this life. This was a sensible
grief to me; yet I resolved to go another
voyage with his mate, who had now the
command of the ship. My misfortunes in
this unhappy voyage were very great; for our
ship sailing towards the Canary Islands, we
were chased by a Salee Rover; and in spite
of all the haste we could make, the pirate
gained upon us, so that we prepared ourselves
to fight. They had 18 guns, and we had
but 12. About three in the afternoon there
was a desperate engagement, wherein many
were killed and wounded on both sides; but
finding ourselves overpowered by numbers,
we were forced to surrender; and were all
carried prisoners into the port of Salee. Our
men were sent to the emperor's court to be
sold there; but the pirate captain kept me
to be his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most
miserable creature upon earth, and the pro-
phecy of my father came afresh into my
thoughts. Some hopes, indeed, I had that
my new patron would go to sea again, where
he might be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese
man-of-war, and then I should be set at
liberty. But in this I was mistaken; for he
never took me with him, but left me to look
after his little garden, and do the drudgery
of his house.
After some length of time my patron, as
I found, grew so poor that he could not fit
out his ship as usual ; and then he used
constantly, once or twice a week, if the
weather was fair, to go out a fishing, taking
me and a young Moresco boy to row the
boat; and so much pleased was he with me
for my dexterity in catching the fish, that
he would often send me with a Moor, who
was one of his kinsmen, and the Moresco
youth, to catch a dish of fish for him.
One morning, as we were at the sport,
there arose such a thick fog that we lost
sight of the shore ; and rowing we knew not
which way, we laboured all the night, and
in the morning found ourselves in the ocean,
two leagues from land ; which however we
at length reached, extremely exhausted by
long fasting; and in order to prevent such
disasters for the future, my patron ordered
a carpenter to build a little state-room or
cabin in the middle of the long boat, with
lockers for provisions.
In this he frequently took us out a fish-
ing ; and one time inviting two or three
persons of distinction to go with him, made
provisions extraordinary, providing also three
fusees, with powder and shot that they might
have some sport at fowling along the sea-
coast. The next morning the boat was
made clean and everything ready, but their
minds altering, my patron ordered us to go
a fishing, as his guests would certainly sup
with him that night.
And now I began seriously to think of
my deliverance. In order to do this, I per-
suaded the Moor to get some provisions on
board, not daring to meddle with our pa-
tron's ; and we stored ourselves with rusk-
biscuit, and three jars of water. Besides, I
privately conveyed into the boat a bottle of
brandy, some twine, thread, a hammer, hatch-
et, and a saw; and, in particular, some bees-
wax, which was a great comfort to me, and
served to make candles. I then persuaded
Muley, (for so was the Moor called) to pro-
cure some powder and shot, pretending to
kill sea-curlews, which he innocently and rea-
dily agreed to. In short, being provided
with all things necessary, we sailed out; I
resolving to make my escape, though it should
cost me my life.
c 2
When we had run from shore I gave the
boy the helm, and pretending to stoop for
something, seized Muley by surprise and
threw him overboard. As he was an ex-
cellent swimmer, he soon arose, and made
towards the boat; upon which I took out
a fusee, and presented at him : " Muley,"
said I, "I never yet designed to do you
any harm, and seek nothing now but my
redemption. I know you are able enough
to swim to shore, and save your life; but
if you are resolved to follow me, to the
endangering of mine, the very moment you
proceed, I will shoot you through the
head." The harmless creature at these
words, turned himself from me, and I make
no doubt got safe to land. Then turning
to the boy Xury, I perceived he trembled
at the action; but I put him out of all fear,
telling him that if he would be true and
faithful to me, I would do well by him. So
innocent did the child then look, and with
 such an obliging- smile consented, that I
readily believed him, and from that day
forward began to love him entirely.
We then pursued our voyage; and hav-
ing a fresh gale of wind, with a pleasant,
smooth sea, by three o'clock next day I
was one hundred and fifty miles beyond the
Emperor of Morocco's dominions. Yet, still
having the dreadful apprehension of being
retaken, I continued sailing for five days
successively, till the wind shifting to the
southward, made me conclude that if any
vessel was in chase of me, they would pro-
ceed no farther. After so much fatigue, I
anchored at the mouth of a little river.
What I principally wanted was fresh water;
and I was resolved, about dusk, to swim
ashore. But no sooner did the gloomy
clouds of night begin to succeed the declining
day, than we heard such barking, roaring,
and howling of wild creatures, that one
might have thought the very strongest
c 3
monsters of nature or infernal spirits had
their residence there.
The next morning I was resolved to go on
shore to get fresh water, and venture my
life among the beasts or savages, should
either attack me. Xury said he would take
one of the jars and bring me some. I asked
him why he would go, and not I ? The poor
boy answered, " If wild mans come, they
eat me, you go away." This nobleness of
mind increased my affection to the child.
" Well, dear Xury," said I, "we will both
go ashore, both kill wild mans, and they shall
eat neither of us." So giving Xury a piece
of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram, we waded
ashore, carrying nothing with us but our
arms, and two jars for water. 1 did not go
out of sight of the boat, as dreading the
savages coming down the river in their canoes ;
but the boy seeing a low descent or vale,
about a mile in the country, he wandered
to it; and, running back to me with great
15
precipitation, I thought he was pursued by
some savage or wild beast; upon which I
approached, resolving to perish or protect
him from danger. As he came nearer to me
I saw something hanging over his shoulders,
which was a creature he had shot, like a
hare, but different in colour, and longer legs;
however, we were glad of it, for it proved
wholesome and nourishing meat; but what
added to our joy was, my boy assured me
there was plenty of wTater, and that he see
no wild ?nans. In this place I began to
consider that the Canary and Cape de Verde
Islands lay not far off. The place I was in
was no doubt that wild country that lies
between the Emperor of Morocco's dominions
and the Negroes. It is filled with wild beasts,
and the Moors chiefly use it for hunting.
From this place I thought I saw the top of
the mountain Teneriff in the Canaries; and
twice in vain I tried to attain it.
Early one morning wTe anchored under a
little point of land ; and the tide beginning
16

  to flow, we lay ready to go further in. But
Xury, whose youthful and penetrating eyes
were sharper than mine, in a soft tone, desired
me to keep far from land, lest we should
be devoured, " For look yonder, master,"
said be, "and see de dreadful monster fast
., .
asleep on de side
of de hill." Ac-
cordingly, looking
where he pointed,
I espied a fearful
monster indeed. It
was a terrible great
^^ lion, that lay on shore

"Xury," said I, "you shall go

of the hill.
on shore and kill him." But the bov look-
ing amazed: "Me kill him!" says lie, "he
eat me at one mouth;" meaning one mouth-
ful. Upon which I bid hirn he still, and
charging my biggest gun with two slugs
and a good charge of powder, I took the
best aim 1 could to shoot him through
the head, but his leg lying over his nose,
the slug broke his knee-bone. The lion
awaking with the pain, got up, but soon fell
down, giving the most hideous groan I
ever heard: but taking m y second piece I
shot him through the head, and then he
lay struggling for life. Upon this Xury
took heart, and desired my leave to go on
shore. " Go then," said I. Upon which,
taking a little gun in one hand, he swam
to the shore with the other, and coming
close to the lion, put a period to his life
by shooting him again through the head.
But this was spending our ammunition
in vain, the flesh not being good to eat.
Xury was like a champion, and came on
board for a hatchet to cut off the head of
18
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
his enemy; but not having strength to per-
form it, he cut off and brought me a foot.
I bethought me, however, that his skin
would be of use. This work cost Xury and
me a whole day; when spreading it on
the top of our cabin, the hot beams of the
sun effectually dried it in two days' time,
and it afterwards served me for a bed to
lie on.
And now we sailed southerly, living spar-
ingly on our provisions, and went no oftener
on shore than we were obliged for fresh
water. My design was to make the river
Gambia or Senegal, or any where about
the Cape de Verde, in hopes to meet some
European ship. If Providence did not so
favour mc, my next course was to seek
for the islands, or lose my life amongst the
Negroes.
One day as we were sailing along, we
saw people stand on the shore looking at
us; we could also perceive they were black
and stark naked. I was inclined to go on
shore, but Xury cried, "No, no;" however,
I approached nearer, and I found they ran
along the shore by me a good way. They
had no weapons in their hands, except one,
who held a long stick, which Xury told
me was a lance, with which they could kill
at a great distance. I talked to them by
signs and made them sensible I wanted some-
thing to eat; they beckoned me to stop my
boat, while two of them ran up into the
country, and in less than half-an-hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of
dried flesh and some corn, which we gladly
accepted; and to prevent any fears on
either side, they brought the food to the
shore, laid it down, then went and stood a
great way off till we fetched it on board,
and then came close to us again.
The Negroes having kindly furnished me
with water, and with what roots and grains
their country afforded, I took my leave
and after eleven days' sail, came in sight
of the Cape de Verde, and those islands
called by its name; when, on a sudden,
Xury cried out, " Master! Master! a ship
with a sail !" and looked as affrighted as if
it was his master's ship sent in search of
us. But I soon discovered she was a Portu-
guese ship. Upon which I strove for my
life to come up to them. But vain had it
been, if through their perspective glasses
they had not perceived me and shortened
their sail to let me come up. Encouraged
at this, I fired a gun, as a signal of dis-
tress; upon which they very kindly lay to,
so that in three hours' time I came up with
them. They spoke to me in Portuguese,
Spanish, and French, but none of these did
I understand; till at length a Scots sailor
called, and then I told him I was an Eng-
lishman, who had escaped from the Moors
at Salee; upon which they took me kindly
on board, with all my effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable
joy I felt at this happy deliverance! who,
from being a late miserable and forlorn
21
creature, was not only relieved, but in fa-
vour with the master of the ship, to whom
in return for my deliverance, I offered all I
had. But he nobly refused any recompence,
and insisted upon paying for my boat its
full value. He gave me sixty pieces for
my boy Xury. It was with great reluctance
I was prevailed upon to sell the child's liberty,
who had served me so faithfully; but he
was willing himself; and it was agreed, that
after ten years he should be made free, upon
his renouncing Mahometanism, and embracing
Christianity.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils,
we arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos,
or All Saints' Bay, in twenty-two days after.
I cannot forget the generous treatment of
the captain. He would take nothing for
my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the
leopard's skin, and thirty for the lion's. In
short, I made about 220 pieces of my cargo;
and with this stock I entered once more into
the scene of life.
Being recommended to an honest planter,
I lived with him till I was informed of the
manner of their planting and making sugar;
and seeing how well they lived, and how
suddenly they grew rich, I- resolved to get
the money I had left in England remitted
to me, and to purchase a plantation.
I hought a settlement next to an honest
and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of
English parents, whose plantation joining
mine, we improved it very amicably to-
gether. Both our stocks were low, and
for two years we planted only for food;
but the third we planted some tobacco,
and each of us dressed a large piece of
ground the ensuing year for canes. I now
found how much I wanted assistance, and
repented the loss of my dear boy Xury.
I was in some measure settled, before
the captain departed from the Brazils. One
day I went to him and told him wdiat
stock I had in London, desiring his assist-
ance in getting it remitted; to which he
readily consented, but would only have me
send for half my money lest it should mis-
carry.—His kindness towards me was great
for he not only procured the money I had
drawn for, but sent me over a servant with
a cargo proportionable to my condition;
together with tools of all sorts, iron-work,
and utensils necessary for my plantation.
Uncommon success crowning my prosper-
ous labours, I might have rested happy in
that middle state of life my father had so
often recommended; but again I left this
happy station from a foolish ambition of
rising; and, once more, cast myself into the
greatest gulf of misery that ever a poor
creature fell into. Having lived four years
in Brazil, I had not only learned the lan-
guage, but contracted acquaintance with the
most eminent planters; to whom, once having
given an account of my two voyages to the
coast of Guinea, and the maimer of trading
there for mere trifles, by which our planta-
tions were furnished with Negroes, they gave
n 2
such attention to what I said, that three
of them came one morning and proposed
to me a voyage to Guinea, in order to
sock the plantation with Negroes, which,
as they could not be publicly sold, they
would divide among them; and if I would
go there supercargo, to manage the trading
part, I should have an equal share of the
Negroes, without providing any stock. I
could not resist the proposal, but accepted
the offer upon condition of their looking
after my plantation.
The ship being fitted out, and all things
ready, we set sail the first of September,
1659, being the same day eight years I left
my father and mother in Yorkshire. We
«ailed northward upon the coast, in order
to gain Africa, till we made Cape Augus-
tine ; from whence going further into the
ocean, out of sight of land, we steered as
though we were bound for the Isle Fernand
de Norenba, leaving the islands on the east;
and then it was that we met with a terrible
tempest, which continued twelve days, the
winds carrying us wherever they pleased.
In this perplexity one of our men died,
and another and a boy were washed over-
board. When the weather cleared up a
little, we found ourselves in eleven degrees
north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea,
Upon this the captain gave reasons for re-
turning, which I opposed, counselling him
to stand away for Barbadoes, which, as I
supposed, might be attained in fifteen days.
So altering our course wTe sailed north-west
and by west, in order to reach the Leeward
Islands; but a second storm succeeding,
drove us to the westward; so that we were
afraid of falling into the hands of cruel
savages, or the paws of devouring beasts of
prey.
In this great distress one of our men,
early in the morning, cried out, "Land,
land!" which he had no sooner said, than
our ship struck upon a sand-bank, and in
a moment the sea broke over her in such
d 3
a manner, that we expected we should all
have perished immediately. We knew not
where we were, or upon what land we were
driven; and we could not so much as hope
that the ship would hold out many minutes,
without breaking in pieces, except the wind,
by a miracle, should change immediately.
While we stood looking at one another,
expecting death every moment, the mate laid
hold of the boat, and with the help of the rest
flung her over the ship's side, and getting
all into her, being eleven of us, committed
ourselves to God's mercy and the wild sea.
When we had rowed, or rather were driven
about a league and a half, a raging wave,
like a lofty mountain, came rolling a-stern
of us, and took us with such fury, that at
once it overset the boat.
Men are generally counted insensible when
struggling in the pangs of death ; but while
I was overwhelmed with water, I had the
most dreadful apprehensions imaginable. For
the joys of heaven and the torments of
hell seemed to present themselves before me
in these dying" agonies. I was going, I
thought, I knew not whither, into a dis-
mal gulph unknown, never to behold my
friends, nor the light of this world any
more! I strove, however, to the last ex-
tremity, while all my companions were over-
powered and entombed in the deep ; and'
it was with great difficulty I kept my breath
till the wave spent itself, and retiring back,
left me on the shore half dead. As soon as
I got on my feet, I ran as fast as I could,
lest another wave should pursue me, and
carry me back again. The sea came after
me like a high mountain, or furious enemy.
The next dreadful wave buried me at once
twenty or thirty feet deep, but at the same
time carried me with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore; when raising
myself, I held out till the water having
spent itself, began to return, at which I
struck forward, and feeling ground with my
feet, I took to my heels again. I was at
length dashed against a piece of rock, in
such a manner as left me senseless; but re-
covering a little before the return of the
wave, which no doubt would have over-
whelmed me, I pushed hastily forward and
reached the main land ; when clambering up
the cliffs of the shore, tired and almost
spent, I sat down on the grass, free from
the dangers of the foaming ocean.
No tongue can express the ecstasies and
transports that my soul felt at the happy
deliverance. I was wrapt in contemplation,
and often lifted up my hands, with the pro-
foundest humility, to the Divine Powers,
for saving my life, when the rest of my
companions were all drowned. I cast my
eyes around, to behold what place I was
in, and what I had next to do. I could
see no house nor people : I was wet, yet
had no clothes; hungry and thirsty, yet
had nothing to eat or drink; no weapon to
destroy any creature for my sustenance, nor
defend myself against devouring beasts; in
short, I had nothing but a knife, a tobacco-
pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco.
The darksome night coming upon me, in-
creased my fears of being devoured by wild
creatures; my mind was plunged in des-
pair, and having no prospect, as I thought,
of life before me, I prepared for another
kind of death than what I had lately escaped.
I walked about a furlong, to see if I could
find any fresh water, which I did to my
great joy; and taking a quid of tobacco to
prevent hunger, I got up into a thick bushy
tree, and seating myself so that I could not
fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that
night buried my sorrows in quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning be-
fore I awaked; when I not only perceived
the tempest had ceased, but saw the ship
driven almost as far as the rock which the
waves had dashed me against, and which wTas
about a mile from the place where I was.
When I came down from my apartment in
the tree, I perceived the ship's boat two
miles distant on my right hand, lying on
shore as the waves had cast her. I thought
to have got to her; but there being an
inlet of water of about half a mile's breadth
between it and me, I returned again towards
the ship, as hoping to find something for
my immediate subsistence. About noon, when
the sea was calm, resolving to get to the
ship, I stripped and leaped into the water;
it was my good fortune to espy a small
piece of rope hanging so low, that by the
help of it, though with great difficulty, I
got into the ship. The provisions I found
in good order, with which I crammed my
pockets, and losing no time, ate while I
was doing other things. I also found some
rum, of which I took a hearty dram; and
now I wanted for nothing except a boat to
carry away what was needful for me.
Necessity quickens invention. We had
several spare yards, a spare topmast or two,
and two or three large spars of wood.
With these I fell to work, and flung as
M
ii biimi:«ii i
 k'
many of them overboard as I could manage,
tying every one of them with a rope, that
they might not drive away. This done, I
went down to the ship's side, and tied four
of them fast together at both ends, in the
form of a raft, and laying two or three
short pieces of plank upon them crossways,
I found it would bear me, but not any con-
siderable weight. Upon which 1 went to
work again, cutting a spare topmast into
three lengths, adding them to my raft with
a great deal of labour and pains. I then
considered what I should load it with, it
being not able to bear a ponderous burden.
And this I soon thought of—first, laying
upon it all the planks and boards I could
get; next, I lowered down three of the
seamen's chests, after I had filled them
with bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
five pieces of dried goat's flesh, and some
European corn; and for liquors I found
several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters,
and four or five gallons of rack, which I
stowed by themselves. By this time the
tide beginning to flow, I perceived my coat,
waistcoat, and shirt swim away, which I
left on the shore; as for my linen breeches
and stockings, I swam with them to the
ship; but I soon found clothes enough,
though I took no more than I wanted for
the present. My eyes were chiefly on tools
to work with; and after a long search, I
found out the carpenter's chest, which I
got safe down on my raft. I then looked
for arms and ammunition, and in the great
cabin found two good fowling-pieces, two
pistols, several powder horns filled, a small
bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I
likewise found three barrels of powder, two
of which were good; also two or three
broken "oars, two saws, an axe, and a ham-
mer. I then put to sea, and in getting to
shore had three encouragements. A smooth,
calm sea, with the tide rising and setting in
to shore, and the little wind there was blew
towards the land. After I had sailed about
a mile, I found the raft drive a little dis-
tance from the place where I first landed;
and then I perceived a little opening of the
land, with a strong current of the tide
running into it; upon which I kept the
middle of the stream. But great was my
concern, when on a sudden the fore part
of my raft ran aground, so that had I not
with great difficulty, for near half an hour,
kept my back straining against the chest,
to keep my effects in their places, all I had
would have gone into the sea. But after
some time, the rising of the water caused
the raft to float again, and coming up a
little river with land on both sides, I landed
in a cave, as near the mouth as possible,
the better to discover a sail, if any provi-
dentially passed that way. Not far off, I
espied a hill of stupendous height, surround-
ed with lesser hills, and thither I was
resolved to go and view the country, that
E
I might see what part was best to fix my
habitation. Accordingly, arming myself with
a pistol, a fowling-piece, powder and ball,
I ascended the mountain. There I perceived
I was in an island, encompassed by the sea,
no distant lands to be seen, but scattering
rocks that lay to the west: it seemed to be
a barren place, inhabited only by wild beasts.
I perceived abundance of fowls, but ignorant
of what kind, or whether good for nourish-
ment; I shot one of them at my return,
which occasioned a confused screaming a-
mong the other birds, and I found it, by
its colour and beak, to be a kind of hawk,
but its flesh perfect carrion.
When I came to my raft, I brought my
effects on shore, and fearing that some cruel
beasts might devour me in the night-time,
I made a kind of hut or barricade with the
chests and boards. I slept very comfortably;
and the next morning got on board as
before, and prepared a second raft far nicer
than the first, upon which I brought away
the carpenter's stores, two or three bags full
of nails, a great jackscrew, a dozen or two
of hatchets, and a grindstone. Two or three
iron crows, two barrels of musket-bullets,
another fowling-piece, a small quantity of
powder, and a large bag full of small shot.
Besides these, I took all the men's clothes
I could find, a spare foretop-sail, a ham-
mock, and some bedding; and thus comple-
ting my second cargo, I made all the haste
to shore 1 could, fearing some wild beast
might destroy what I had there already,
But I only found a little wild cat, sitting
on one of the chests, which seeming not to
fear me, or the gun that I presented at her,
I threw her a piece of biscuit which she
instantly ate and departed.
When I had got these effects on shore, I
went to work, in order to make me a little
tent with the sail and some poles which I had
cut for that purpose; and having finished it,
what things might be damaged by the wea-
ther I brought in, piling all the empty chests'
and casks in a circle, the better to fortify it
against any sudden attempt of man or beast.
After this, I blocked up the doors with
some boards, charged my gun and pistol,
and laying my bed on the ground, slept
comfortably till next morning.
Now, though I had enough to subsist
upon a long time, yet despairing of a sudden
deliverance, I coveted as much as I could;
and so long as the ship remained in that
condition, I daily brought away one neces-
sary or other; particularly the rigging, sails,
and cordage, some twine, a barrel of wet
powder, some sugar, a barrel of meal, three
casks of, rum, and, what indeed was most
welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.
Thirteen days I had now been in the island,
and eleven times on board, bringing away
all that was possible. As I was going the
twelfth time the wind began to rise; how-
ever, 1 ventured at low water, and rum-
maging the cabin, in a locker I found several
razors, scissors, and some dozens of knives
and forks; and in another thirty-six pounds
of pieces of eight, silver and gold. " Ah!
simple vanity," said I, " whom this world
so much dotes on, where is now thy virtue,
thy excellency to me ? You cannot procure
me one thing needful, nor remove me from
this desolate island to a place of plenty.
One of these knives, so meanly esteemed>
is to me preferable to all this heap. E'en,
therefore, remain where thou art, to sink in
the deep as unregarded, even as a creature
whose life is not worth preserving/' Yet,
after all, I wrapt it up in a piece of canvass,
and began to think of making another raft;
but I soon perceived the wind began to
rise, a fresh gale blowing from the shore,
and the sky overcast with clouds and dark-
ness ; so, thinking a raft to be in vain, I
let myself into the water, with what things
e 3
I had about me, and it was with much
difficulty I got ashore, when soon after it
blew a fearful storm.
That night I slept very contentedly in
my little tent, surrounded with all my ef-
fects ; but, when I looked out in the morn-
ing, no more ship was to be seen. My
next thoughts were how I should secure
myself from savages and wild beasts, if
any such were in the island. At one time
I thought of digging a cave; at another I
was for erecting a tent; and, at length, I
resolved to do both.
I found a little plain near a rising hill
the front towards which being as steep as
a house side, nothing could descend on
me from the top. On the side of this rock
was a little hollow place, resembling the
entrance or door of a cave. Just before
this place, on the circle of the green, I
resolved my tent should stand. This plain
did not much exceed a hundred vards broad,
39
and about twice as long, like a delightful
green before my door, with a pleasing though
an irregular descent every way to the low
ground by the sea side, lying on the N.W.
side of the hill; so that it was sheltered
from the excessive heat of the sun. After
this I drew a semicircle, containing ten yards
in a semi-diameter and twenty yards in the
whole, driving down two rows of strong
stakes, not six inches from each other^
Then with a piece of cable which I had
cut on board I regularly laid them in a
circle between the piles up to their tops,
which were more than five feet out of
the earth; and after, drove another row of
piles, looking withinside against them, be-
tween two or three feet high, which made
me conclude it a little impregnable castle
against men and beasts. And for mv better
security I would have no door, but entered
in and came out by the help of a ladder
which I also made.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
 HERE was
my feuce
and ray for-
tress, into
w h i c h I
ried all my
riches, ammuni-
tion, and stores.
After which work-
ing on the rock, with what dirt and stones
I dug out, I not only raised my ground two
feet, but made a little cellar to my mansion-
house ; and this cost me many days' labour
and pains. One day, in particular, a show-
er of rain falling, thunder and lightning en-
sued, which put me in terror lest my powder
should take fire. To prevent which, I fell
to making boxes and bags, in order to
separate it, having by me near loOlbs.
weight. And, thus being established as king
of the island, every day I went out with
my gun to see what I could kill that was
fit to eat. 1 soon perceived numbers of
goats, and shot one suckling a young kid;
which, not thinking its dam slain, stood by
her unconcerned; and when I took the
dead creature up, the young one followed
me even to the enclosure. I lifted the kid
over the pales, and would willingly have
kept it alive; but finding it would not eat
I killed that also.
It was by the account I kept, the 30th
of September, when I first landed on this
island. About twelve days after, fearing
lest I should lose my reckoning of time,
nay, even forget the sabbath days, for want
of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a
knife upon a large post, in great letters, these
words, / came on shore, Sept. 30, 1659.
Every day I cut a notch with my knife
on the sides of this square post, and tha
on the sabbath was as long again as the
rest; and every first day of the month as
long again as that long one. Had I made
a more strict search I need not have set
up this mark; for among my parcels I
found the very things I wanted; particu-
larly pens, ink, and paper; also two or
three compasses, some mathematical instru-
ments, dials, perspective glasses, books of
navigation, three English Bibles, and several
other good books, which I carefully put up.
A dog and two cats were on board, and I
made them inhabitants with me in my castle.
Though one might think I had all the neces-
saries that were desirable, yet still I found
several things wanting. My ink was daily
wasting; I wanted needles, pins, and thread,
to mend my clothes, and particularly a
spade, pickaxe, or shovel, to remove the
earth. It was a year before I finished my
little bulwark.
Having raised a turf wall ag-ainst the out-
side of my habitation, I thatched it so close
as might keep it from the inclemency of the
weather; I also improved it within, enlarged
my cave, and made a passage and door in
the rock, which came out beyond the pale
of my fortification. I next proceeded to make
a chair and a table. When I wanted a plank
or board, I hewed down a tree with my
hatchet, making it as thin with my axe as
possible, and then smooth enough with an
adze to answer my designs; thus in time I
got boards enough to shelter all ray stores.
But now a very strange event happened.
For one day finding a bag, which used to
hold corn for the fowls, I resolved to put
gunpowder in it, and shook all the husks
and dirt upon one side of the rock, little
expecting what the consequence would be.
The rain had fallen plentifully a few days
before; and about a month after, to my
great amazement, something began to look
very green and flourishing; and when I
came to view it more nicely every day as
it grew, I found about ten or twelve ears
of green barley appearing in the very same
shape and make as that in England. I can
scarce express the agitations of my mind at
this sight. Hitherto I had looked upon the
actions of this life only as the events of
blind chance. But now the appearance of
this barley, flourishing in a barren soil, and
my ignorance in not conceiving how it should
come there, made me conclude, that miracles
were not yet ceased: nay, I even thought
that God had appointed it to grow there
without any seed, purely for my sustenance
in this miserable and desolate island. And
indeed such great effect this had upon me,
that it often made me melt into tears,
through a grateful sense of God's mercies;
and the greater still was my thankfulness,
when I perceived about this little field of barley
some rice-stalks , also wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded
there must be more corn in the island; and
therefore made a diligent search among the
rocks; but not being able to find any, on
a sudden it came into my mind how I had
shaken the husks of corn out of the bag,
and then my admiration ceased, with my
gratitude to the Divine being, as thinking
it was but natural, and not to be conceived
a miracle, though even the manner of its
preservation might have made me own it was
a wonderful event of God's kind providence.
It was about the latter end of June when
the ears of this corn ripened, which I laid
up very carefully, together with twenty or
thirty stalks of rice, expecting one day I
should reap the fruit of my labour; yet four
years were expired before I could allow my-
self to eat any barley-bread, and much
longer time before I had any rice. After
F
this with much indefatigable pains and in-
dustry, for three or four months, at last I
finished my wall on the 14th of April,
having no way to go into it but by a ladder
against the wall.—April 17th I finished my
ladder, and ascended it; afterwards pulled
it up, then let it down on the other side,
and descended into my new habitation,
where I had space enough, and so fortified
that nothing could attack me without scaling
the walls.
But what does all human pains and in-
dustry avail, if the blessing of God does
not crown our labours ? Or who can stand
before the Almighty, when he stretcheth
forth his arm ? For one time, as I was
at the entrance of my cave, there happened
such a dreadful earthquake, that not only
the roof of the cave came tumbling about
my ears, but the posts seem to crack terribly
at the same time. This put me in great
amazement; and running to the ladder, and
getting over the wall, I then plainly knew
it was an earthquake; the place I stood on
sustained three terrible shocks in less than
three minutes. But judge of my terror
when I saw the top of a great rock roll
into the sea! I then expected the island
would be swallowed up every moment; and
what made the scene still more dreadful, was
to see the sea thrown in the most violent
agitation and disorder by this tremendous
accident. For my part, I stood like a cri-
minal at the place of execution, ready to
expire. At the moving of the earth I was,
as it were, sea-sick; and very much afraid
lest the rock, under which was my defence
and habitation, should overwhelm it and my-
self in a lasting tomb.
When the third dreadful shock had spent
itself, my spirits began to revive: yet still
I would not venture to ascend the ladder,
but continued sitting, not knowing what I
should do. So little grace had I then, as
f 2
only to say, Lord have mercy upon me! and
no sooner was the earthquake over, than
that pathetic prayer left me.
It was not long after that, when a horrible
tempest arose, at the same time attended
with a hurricane of wind. The sea seemed
mountains high, and the waves rolled so
impetuously, that nothing could be perceived
but froth and foam. Three hours did this
storm continue, and in so violent a manner,
as to tear the very trees up by the roots,
which was succeeded by abundance of rain.
When the tempest was over, I went to my
tent; but the rain coming on in a furious
manner, I was obliged to take shelter in the
cave, where I was forced to cut a channel
through my fortification to let the water out.
It continued raining all that night, and some
time the next day. These accidents made
me resolve, as soon as the weather cleared
up, to build me a little hut in some open
place, walled round to defend me from wild
creatures and savages; not doubting but at
the nest earthquake, the mountain would
fall upon my habitation and me, and swallow
up all in its bowels.
When I began to put my resolution in
practice, I was stopped for want of tools
and instruments to work with. Most of my
axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned
by cutting the hard timber that grew on the
island. It took me up full a week to make
my grindstone of use.
As I walked along the sea-shore, I found
a barrel of gunpowder, and several pieces
of the wreck the sea had flung up. Having
secured these I made to the ship, whose
stern was torn off, and washed a great
distance ashore; but the rest lay in the
sands.
At this time I was afflicted with an ague;
thirsty, yet could not help myself to water :
prayed to God in these words: '* Lord, in
pity look upon me: Lord, have mercy upon
f 3
me: have mercy upon me!" After this I
fell asleep and dreamed.
Something refreshed with sleep, I arose;
and, after eating some turtle's eggs, I at-
tempted to walk again out of doors with
my gun; but was so weak, that I sat down,
and looked at the sea, which was smooth
and calm. While I continued here, these
thoughts came into ray mind:—
In what manner is the production of the
earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much ? From whence came myself, and all
other creatures living, and of what are they
made?
Our beings were assuredly created by some
almighty, invisible Power, who framed the
earth, the sea, the air, and all therein, But
what is that Power ?
Certainly it must follow, that God has
created all. Yet, said I, if God has made
all this, he must be the ruler of all; for
certainlv the Power that makes must indis-
putably be able to guide and direct them.
And if so, nothing can happen without his
knowledge and appointment. Then certainly
God has appointed these my sufferings. I
then proceeded to enquire, why should God
deal with me in this manner ? Or what had
I done to deserve his indignation ?
Here Conscience cried with a loud and
piercing voice, " Unworthy wretch! how da-
rest thou ask what thou hast done ? Look
on thy past life, and see what thou hast left
undone! Ask thyself, why thou wert not
long ago in the merciless hands of death ?
Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads, or
killed in the fight when the ship was taken by
the Salee man-of-war ? Why not entombed
in the bowels of the wild beasts on the
African coast, or drowned here when all thy
companions suffered shipwreck in the ocean ?"
Struck dumb with these reflections, I rose,
being so thoughtful I could not sleep, and
fearing the dreadful return of my distemper.
I recollected that the Brazillians used tobacco
for almost all diseases, and going to my
chest in order to find some, Heaven, no
doubt, directed me to a cure for both soul
and body; for there I found one of the Bi-
bles, which, till this time, I had neither
leisure nor inclination to look into. And no
sooner did I open it, but there appeared to
me these words, " Call on me in the day of
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me."
At first, this sentence made a very deep
impression on my heart, but it soon wore off
again, when I considered the word deliver
was foreign to me. And as the children of
Israel said, when they were promised flesh
to eat, " Can God spread a table in the
wilderness ?" In like manner I began to
say, " Can God himself deliver me from
this desolate island;" However, the words
still returned to my mind, and afterwards
made a greater impression upon me.
As it was now very late, I felt inclined to
sleep; but before I would lie down I fell on
my knees, and implored the promise that
God had made 'me in the Holy Scripture,
that " if I called upon him in the day of
trouble, he would deliver me." With much
difficulty, I afterwards drank the rum, where-
in 1 had steeped the tobacco, which, flying1
into my head, threw me into such a pro-
found sleep, that it was three o'clock the
next day before I awoke; indeed I believe
I slept two days, having lost a day in my
account. When I got up, my spirits were
lively and cheerful: I was very hungry;
and, in short, no fit returned the next day,
but I found myself much altered for the better.
I had now been about ten months in the
island; and, as I had never seen any of
the human kind, I accounted myself as sole
monarch; and as I grew better, having
secured my habitation to my mind, I re-
solved to make a tour round my kingdom,
in order to make new discoveries.
54
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
  gs8* THE 15th of July I
began my journey. I
first went to the creek,
where I had brought
my rafts on shore,
and travelling further,
found that the tide
went no higher than two miles up, where
there was a little brook of running water,
on the banks of which were many pleasant
savannahs, or meadows, plain, smooth, and
covered with grass. On the rising part,
where, I supposed the water did not reach,
I perceived a great deal of tobacco growing
to a very strong stalk. Several other plants
I likewise found, the virtues of which I did
not understand, I searched a long time for
the cavassa-root, which I knew the Indians
of that climate made then* "bread of, but all
in vain. There were several plants of aloes,
though at that time I knew not what they
were; I saw also several sugar-canes, but
imperfect for want of cultivation. With
these few discoveries, I came back that night,
and slept contentedly in my little castle.
The next day, going the same way, but
further than the day before, I found the
country more adorned with woods and trees.
Here I perceived different fruits in great
abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the
ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe and very
rich spread over the trees. You may ima-
gine I was glad of the discovery, yet ate
very sparingly. The grapes I found of ex-
cellent use; for when I had dried them in
the sun, which preserved them as dried rai-
sins are kept, they proved very wholesome
and nourishing, and served me in those
seasons when no grapes were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I ascended a
tree, and slept very comfortably, though it
was the first time^ I had lain out of my
habitation. And when the morning came,
I proceeded with great pleasure on my way,
travelling about four miles, as I imagined^
by the length of the valley, directing my
course northward. At end of the valley,
I came to an opening, where the country
seemed to descend to the west: there I found
a little spring of fresh water, proceeding
out of the side of the hill, with its crystal
streams running directly east. And, indeed,
here my senses were charmed with the most
beautiful landscape nature could afford; for
the country appeared flourishing, green, and
delightful. I then descended on the side of
that delicious vale, when I found abundance
of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees,
but very wild and barren at that time. The
limes were delightful and wholesome, and
the juice, mixed in water, was very cooling
and refreshing. I resolved to carry home a
store of grapes, limes, and lemons, against
the approaching wet seasons; and returned
to my little castle, after having spent three
days in this journey.
And now contemplating the fruitfulness of
this valley, its security from storms, and
the delightfulness of the adjacent woods, I
resolved to make a little kind of bower,
surrounding it with a double hedge, as high
as I could reach, well staked and filled
with bulrushes: and having spent a great
part of the month of July, I think it was
the first of August before I began to enjoy
my labour.
On the 30th September, casting up the
notches on my post, which amounted to 365,
I concluded this to be the anniversary of
my landing; and, therefore, humbly pros-
trating myself on the ground, confessing
my sins, acknowledge God's righteous judg-
ments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ
to have mercy upon me, I fasted for
twelve hours till the going down of the
sun; and then, eating a biscuit and a bunch
of grapes, laid me on the bed, and with
great comfort took my night's repose.—You
may call to mind what I have mentioned
of some barley and rice which I had saved,
about thirty stalks of the former, and twenty
of the latter ; and, at that time, the sun being
in its southern position, going from me,
together with the rains, made me conclude
it a very proper season to sow it. Accord-
ingly I dug up a piece of ground with my
wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts,
sowed about two-thirds of my seed, preserv-
ing by me about a handful of each. And
happy it was I did so; for no rains falling,
it was choked up, and never appeared above
the earth till the wet season came again;
and then part of it grew as if it had been
newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial;
and seeking for a moister piece of ground
near my bower, I sowed the rest of my
seed in February, a little before the vernal
equinox; which, having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, yielded a
noble crop. I had still saved part of the
seed, not daring to venture all; and by the
time 1 found out the proper seasons to sow
it in, and that I might expect every year
two seed-times and two harvests, my stock
amounted to above half a peck of each sort
of strain.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
 O sooner were rains
over, but the stakes
which I had cut
from the trees, shot
out like willows, the
first year after lop-
ping their heads. I was ignorant of the
tree I cut them from; but the}' grew so
regularly beautiful, that they made a most
lively appearance, and so flourished in three
years* time, that I resolved to cut more of
them; and these soon growing made a glo-
rious fence.
And now I perceived that the seasons of
the year might generally be divided not into
summer and winter, as in Europe, but into
wet and dry seasons.
The wet season continued longer or short-
er, as the winds happened to blow. But
having found the ill-consequences of being
abroad in the rain, I took care beforehand
to furnish myself with provisions; and dur-
ing the wet months, sat within doors as
much as possible. At this time I contrived
to make many things I wanted. The first
I tried was a basket; but all the twigs
proved so brittle, that I could not perform
it. When a boy, I took great delight in
standing at a basket maker's in the same
town where my father lived, to view them
work; and like other boys, curious and very-
officious to assist, I perfectly learned the
method, and wanted nothing but tools. And
recollecting that the twigs of the tree of
which I made my stakes might be as tough
as osiers growing in England, I resolved to
make an experiment; went the next day
to my country seat, and after cutting down
a quantity, I dried them, and when fit to
work, carried them to my cave, where I
g 3
employed myself in making several sorts of
baskets. It is true, they were not cleverly
made, yet they served my turn upon all
occasions.
Still I had no cask to hold my liquor;
neither had I a pot to boil anything in.
I wanted likewise at the beginning of this
dry season a tobacco-pipe.
I now resumed my intention of exploring
the island; taking my dog, gun, hatchet,
two biscuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins,
with a larger quantity of powder and shot
than usual, I began my journey. Having
passed the vale where my bower stood, I
came within view of the sea, lying to the
west; when it being a clear day, I de-
scried land, extending from the W. to the
S.W. about ten or fifteen leagues, but could
not say whether it was an island or continent.
As I proceeded forward, I found this side
of the island much more pleasant than mine;
the fields fragrant, adorned with sweet flow"
ers and verdant grass, together with several
very fine woods. There were parrots in
plenty, which made me long for one to be
my companion; but it was with great
difficulty I could knock one down; and I
kept him some years before I could get him
to call me by my name.
In the low grounds, I found various sorts
of hares and foxes, but different from those
in England. Several of these I killed, but
never ate them; neither, indeed, had I any
occasion, for abounding with goats, pigeons,
turtle, and grapes, I could defy Leadenhall-
market to furnish me a better table. When
I came to the sea-shore, I was amazed at
the splendour. The strand was covered with
shells of the most beautiful fish, and abound-
ing wTith innumerable turtles, and fowls of
many kinds. I might have shot as many
as I pleased, but was sparing of my
ammunition, rather choosing to kill a she-
goat, which I did with much difficulty, on
account of the flatness of the country.
I continued my journey, travelling about
twelve miles further towards the east, where
I set a great pile on the shore for a mark.
In this journey my dog surprised a kid,
and would have killed it, had I not prevented
him. As I had often been thinking of get-
ing a kid or two, and so raising a breed of
tame goats to supply me after my ammu-
nition was spent, I took this opportunity of
beginning: and having made a collar for
this little creature, with a string of rope-
yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there
enclosed and left him; and having spent a
month in this journey, at length I returned
to my own habitation, and rested myself a
week, which time I employed in making a
cage for my pretty Poll. I now recollected
my poor kid I had left in the bower, and
immediately went to fetch it home. When
I came there, I found it almost starved: I
gave it some food, and it followed me like
a dog; and as I constantly fed it, it became
so loving, gentle, and fond, that it would
never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox
being now come, I kept the 30th of Septem-
ber in the most solemn manner as usual, it
being the third year of my ahode in the
island. I spent the whole day in acknow-
ledging God's mercies, in giving Him thanks
for making this solitary life as agreeable
and less sinful than that of human society;
and for the communications of his grace to
my soul, in supporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon his providence,
and hope for his eternal presence in the
world to come.
One morning, opening my Bible, I imme-
diately fixed my eyes upon these words, " I
will never leave thee nor forsake thee!"
Surely, thought I, these words are directed
to me; and if God does not forsake, what
matter is it, since he can make me more
happy in this state of life than if I enjoyed
the greatest splendour in the world ? I shut
the Bible and blessed kind Providence, that
directed my good friend in England to send
t without any order, and for assisting me
to save it from the power of the raging
ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my
several daily employments were these :—First
—My duty to Heaven, and diligently read-
ing the Holy Scriptures, which I did twice
or thrice every day. Secondly—Seeking pro-
visions with my gun, which commonly em-
ployed me, when it did not rain, three hours
every morning. Thirdly—The ordering, cu-
ring, preserving, and cooking what I had
killed, for my supply, which took me up
the greater part of the day. I was no less
than two-and-forty days making a board fit
for a long shelf, which two sawyers, with
their tools and sawpit, would have cut off
the same tree in half a day. It was a
large tree, as my board was to be broad.
I was three days in cutting it down, and
two more in lopping off the boughs, and
reducing it to a piece of timber. This
I hacked and hewed off each side till it be-
came light to move: and then I turned it,
made one side of it smooth and flat as a
board from end to end, then turned it
downwards, cutting the other side till I
brought the plank to be about three inches
thick, and smooth on both sides.
The harvest months, November and De-
cember were now at hand, in which I had
the pleasing prospects of a very good crop.
But here I met wTith a new misfortune; for
the goats and hares having tasted the sweet-
ness of the blade, kept it so short that it
had not strength to shoot up into a stalk.
To prevent this, I enclosed it with a hedge,
and by day shot some of its devourers; and
my dog, which I tied to the field gate,
barking all night, so frightened those crea-
tures that I got entirely rid of them. But
no sooner did I get rid of these, than other
enemies appeared, whole flocks of several
sorts of birds only waited till my back was
turned to ruin me. So much did this
provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three
of the malefactors; and afterwards served
them as they do notorious thieves in Eng-
land, hung them up in chains as a terror
to others. And so good an effect had this,
that they not only forsook the corn, but
all that part of the island, so long as
these criminals hung there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter
end of December, which was my second
harvest, I reaped it with a scythe made of
one of my broad swords. I had no fatigue
in cutting down my first crop, it was so
slender. The ears I carried home in a
basket, rubbing them with my hands, in-
stead of thrashing; and when the harvest
was over, found my half-peck of seed pro-
duced near two bushels of nee, and two
bushels and "a half of barley. I knew not
how to grind my corn, neither how to bake
the bread.
The want of a plough to turn up the
earth, or shovel to dig it, I conquered by
making a wooden spade. The want of a
harrow I supplied by dragging over the corn
a great bough of a tree. When it was
growing I was forced to fence it; when
ripe, to mow it, carry it home, thresh it,
and part it from the chaff. And after all I
wanted a mill to grind it, sieve to dress it,
Yeast and salt to make it into bread, and
an oven to bake it. This set my brains
to work to find some expedient for every
one of these necessaries against the next
harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care
was to prepare more land. I pitched upon
two large flat pieces of ground, near my
castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed
my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge.
B
This to.k me up three months; by which
time the wet season coming on, and the
rain keeping me within doors, I found se-
veral occasions to employ myself; and while
at work, used to divert myself in talking
to my parrot,, learning him to know and
speak his own name, Poll—the first wel-
come word I ever heard spoke in the island.
I had been a long time contriving how to
make earthen vessels, which I wanted ex-
tremely ; and when I considered the heat
of the climate, I did not doubt but if I
could find any such clay, I might make a
pot strong enough, when dried in the sun,
to bear handling, and to hold anything that
was dry, as corn, meal, and other things.
The clay I found, but it would make the
most serious person smile, to see what
awkward, ugly, misshapen things I made;
how many cracked by the violent heat of
the sun, and fell in pieces when they were
removed; so that I think it was two months
before I could perfect anything; and even
then but two clumsy things in imitation of
earthen jars. As for the smaller things, I
made them with better success; such as
little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and
pipkins, the sun baking them very hard.
Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely
necessary, and that was an earthen pot,
not only to hold my liquid, but also to bear
the fire, which none of these could do. It
once happened, that as I was putting out
my fire, I found therein a broken piece of
one of my vessels burnt as hard as a rock,
and red as a tile. This made me think of
burning some pots, and having no notion
of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, I
fixed three large pipkins, and two or three
pots in a pile one upon another. The fire
I piled round the outside, and dry wood
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the
inside red-hot, and found that they were
not cracked at all: and when I perceived
them perfectly red, I let one of them stand
in the fire about five or six hours, till the
clay melted by the extremity of the heat,
and would have run to glass had I suffered
it; upon which I slackened my fire by de-
grees, till the redness abated; and watching
them till morning, I found I had three very
good pipkins and two earthen pots, as well
burnt as I could desire.
No joy could be greater than mine at this
discovery. I filled one of my pipkins with
water to boil me some meat.
The next concern I had, was to get me
a stone mortar to beat some corn in, instead
of a mill to grind it. But all the stones
of the island being of a mouldering nature,
I resolved to look out for a great block of
hard wood, which having found, I formed
it with my axe and hammer, and then, with
infinite labour, made a hollow in it, just as
the Indians of Brazil make their canoes.
When I had finished this, I made a great
pestle of iron-wood, and then laid them up
against my succeeding harvest.
My next business was to make a sieve to
sift my meal, and part it from the bran and
husk. Having no fine, thin canvass, I could
not tell what to do. What linen I had was
reduced to rags. At length I remembered
I had some neckcloths of calico or muslin,
of the sailors, which I had brought out of
the ship, and with these I made three small
sieves, proper enough for the work.
The want of an oven I supplied by mak-
ing some earthen pans, very broad but not
deep. When I had a mind to bake, I made
a great fire upon the hearth, the tiles of
which I had made myself; and when the
wood was burnt into live coals, I spread
them over it, till it became very hot; then
sweeping them away, I set down my loaves,
and turning down the earthen pots upon
them, drew the ashes and coals all round
the outsides of the pots, to continue the
h 3
heat; and in this manner I baked my bar-
ley loaves as well as if I bad been a com-
plete pastrycook, and also made of the rice
several cakes and puddings.
These things took me np the best part
of a year, and what intermediate time I had
was bestowed in managing my new harvest
and husbandry; for in the proper season I
reaped my corn, carried it home, and laid it
up in the ear in my large baskets, till I
had time to rub it, instead of threshing.
All' this while, the prospect of land,
which I had seen from the other side of
the island, ran in my mind. I still medi-
tated a deliverance from this place, though
the fear of greater misfortunes might have
deterred me from it. For allowing that I
had attained that place, I ran the hazard
of being killed and eaten by the devouring
cannibals; and if they were not so, yet I
might be slain as other Europeans had been
who fell into their hands. Notwithstanding
(ill this, my thoughts ran continually upon
that shore. I wished for my boy Xury,
and the long-boat; the ship's boat had been
cast a great way on the shore in the late
storm. Her bottom being turned up by
the impetuosity and fury of the waves and
wind I fell to work with all the strength I
had, with levers and rollers I had cut from
the wood, to turn her, and repair the da-
mages she had sustained. This work took
me up three or four weeks, when finding
my little strength in vain, I fell to under-
mining it by digging away the sand, and
so to make it fall down, setting pieces of
wood to thrust and guide it in the fall.
But after this was done, I was still unable
to move it towards the water, and so wTas
forced to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not
frighten me. I began to think whether it
was not possible for me to make a canoe,
such as the Indians make of the trunk of
a tree. But here I lay under particular
inconveniences; want of tools to make it,
and want of hands to move it in the water
when it was made.
/ /
•
 HOWEVER,
to work I went:
I first cut down a
cedar-tree, which
was five feet ten
inches in diame-
ter at the lower
part next the
stump, and four
eleven inches in diameter at the end of
twentv-two feet, after which it lessened fur
a space, and then parted into branches.
Twenty days was I hacking and hewing
this tree at the bottom, fourteen more in
cutting off the branches and limbs, and a
^Hj
whole month in shaping- it like the bottom
of a boat. As for the inside, I was three
weeks with a mallet and chisel clearing it,
till it was big enough to carry twenty-six
men, much bigger than any canoe I ever
saw in my life, and consequently sufficient
to transport me and all my effects to that
wished-for shore.
Nothing remained now, but to get it into
the water, it lying about one hundred yards
from it. I proceeded to measure the dis-
tance of ground, resolving to make a canal in
order to bring the water to the canoe, since
I could not bring the canoe to the wrater.
But as this seemed to be impracticable,
under the space of eleven or twelve years, I
concluded the attempt altogether vain. I
now saw what stupidity it is to begin work
before we reckon on its cost, or judge
rightly our own abilities to go through with
its performance.
In the height of this work my fourth
year expired, from the time I was cast on
this island. At this time I did not forget
my anniversary ; but kept it with rather
greater devotion than before. For now my
hopes being frustrated, I looked upon this
world as a thing I had nothing to do with;
and well might I say, as father Abraham
said unto Dives, " Between thee and me
there is a gulph fixed." I was separated
from its wickedness too, having neither the
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor
the pride of life; I had nothing to covet,
being lord, king, and emperor over the
whole country, without dispute and without
control. Corn, plenty of turtles, timber
in abundance, and grapes above measure.
What was all the rest to me ? The money
I had, lay by me as despicable dross, which
I would freely have given for a gross of
tobacco-pipes, or a hand-mill to grind my
corn; in a word, the nature and experience
ot these things dictated to me this just
reflection: That the good things of this
world are no further good to us, than they
are for our use; and that whatsoever we
may heap up to give to others, we can
but enjoy as much as we use.
These thoughts rendered my mind more
easy than usual. Every time I sat down
to meat, I did it with thankfulness, admiring
the providential hand of God, who, in this
wilderness, had spread a table for me.
As long as my ink continued, which, with
water, I made last as long as I could, I
used to minute down the days of the month
on which any remarkable event happened.
First, I observed that the same day I
forsook my parents and friends, and ran
away to Hull, in order to go to sea; the
same day in the next year, I was taken
and made a slave by the Salee rovers.
That the very day I escaped out of the
wreck of the ship in Yarmouth roads, a
year after on the same day, I made my es-
X
r*-sii>i «*#.??!
 cape from Salee in my patron's fishing-boat.
And, on the 30th of September, being
my birth-day, was I miraculously saved, and
cast ashore on this island.
The next thing that wasted after my ink,
was the biscuits which I had brought out
of the ship; and though I allowed myself
but one cake a day for above a twelvemonth,
yet I was quite out of bread for near a year,
before I got any corn of my own.
In the next place, my clothes began to
decay, and my linen had been gone long
before. However, I had preserved about
three dozen of the sailor's chequered shirts,
which proved a great refreshment to me,
when the violent beams of the sun would
not suffer me to bear any of the seaman's
heavy watch coats; wThich made me turn
tailor, and after a miserable botching man-
ner, converted them into jackets. To pre-
serve my head, I made a cap of goafs-skin,
with the hair outwards to keep out the rain ;
1
and afterwards, a waistcoat and open-kneed
breeches of the same. I contrived a sort
of umbrella, covering it with skins, which
not only kept out the heat of the sun, but
the rain also. Thus, being- easy and settled
in my mind, my chief happiness was to
converse with God in prayer.
For five years after this nothing extraor-
dinary occurred to me. My chief employ-
ment was to cure my raisins, and plant my
barley and rice, of both which I had a
year's provision before hand. Though I
was disappointed in my first canoe, I made
at intermediate times, a second, of much
inferior size; and it wras two years before
I had finished it. But as I perceived it
would in no wise answer my design of
sailing to the other shore, my thoughts
were confined to take a tour round the
island, to see what further discoveries I
could make. To this intent, after having
moved her to the water, and tried how she
would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my
boat, and made a sail of the ship's sail that
lay by me. I then made lockers or boxes
at the end of it, to put in necessaries,
provision and ammunition, which would pre-
serve them dry, either from rain or the spray
of the sea; and in the inside of the boat,
I out a long hollow place to lay my gun
in; and to keep it dry, made a flag to
hang over it. My umbrella I fixed in a
step in the stern, like a mast, to keep the
heat of the sun off me. And now resolving
to see the circumference of my little king-
dom, I victualled my ship for the voyage,
putting in two dozen of my barley-bread
loaves, an earthen pot full of parched rice,
a little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder
and shot, and two watch-coats. It was the
Gth of November, in the 6th year of my
captivity, that I set out on this voyage;
which was much longer than I expected,
being obliged to put farther out, on account
of the rocks. And indeed, so much did these
rocks surprise me, that I was for putting
back fearing that if I ventured farther it
would be out of my power to return. In this
uncertainty I came to anchor just on shore,
to which I waded with my gun on my
shoulder, and then climbing a hill, which
overlooked that point, I saw the full extent
of it, and resolved to run all hazards. That
night it grew so calm that I ventured out;
and here I may be a monument to all rash
and ignorant pilots ; for I was no sooner
come to the point, and not above a boat's
length from shore, but I was got into deep
water, with a current like a mill, which
drove my boat along so violently, that it
was impossible for me to keep near the edge
of it, but forced me more and more out from
the eddy to the left of me; and all I could
do with my paddles was useless, there being
no wind to help me.
Who can conceive the present anguish of
my mind at this calamity ? With longing
c^es did I look upon my little kingdom and
thought the island the pleasantest place in
the universe. " Happy, thrice happy desert,''
said I, " shall I never see thee more ?
Wretched creature! whither am I going ?
Why did I murmur at my lonesome condi-
tion when now I would give the whole
world to be thither again ?" While I was
thus complaining, I found myself driven
about two leagues into the sea; however,
I laboured till my strength was far spent,
to keep my boat as far north as possible.
About noon, I perceived a little breeze of
wind spring up from the S. S. E. which
overjoyed my heart; and I was still more
elated, when in about half an hour, it blew
a gentle fine gale. I set up my mast again,
spread my sail, and stood away northward
as much as I could, to get rid of the
current. And no sooner did the boat begin
to stretch away, but I perceived, by the
i 3
clearness of the water, a change of the
current was near. About four o'clock in the
afternoon, I reached within a league of the
island, and within an hour came within a
mile of the shore, where I soon landed to
my unspeakable comfort; and after an hum-
ble prostration thanking God for my deli-
verance, with resolution to lay all thoughts
of escaping aside, I brought my boat safe
to a little cove, and laid down to take a
welcome repose. When I awoke, I consi-
dered how I might get my boat home; and
coasting along the shore, I came to a good
bay which ran up to a rivulet or brook,
where, finding a good harbour, I stowed her
as safe as if she had been in a dry dock
made on purpose for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the
place where before I had travelled on foot;
so taking nothing with me, except my gun
and umbrella, I began my journey; and in
he evening, came to my bower, where I
again laid me down to rest. I had not
slept long- before I was awakened in great
surprise, by a strange voice that called me
several times, " Robin, Robin, Robinson Cru-
soe, Poor Robin! Where are you, Robinson
Crusoe ? Where are you ? Where have you
been ?"
So fast was I asleep at first, that I did
not awake thoroughly; but half asleep and
half awake, I thought I dreamed that some-
body spoke to me. But as the voice repeat-
ed Robinson Crusoe several times, being
terribly affrighted, I started up; and no soon-
er were my eyes fully open, but I beheld
my pretty Poll sitting on the top of the
hedge, and soon knew that it was he that
called me ; for just in such bewailing language
I used to talk and teach him; which he so
exactly learned, that he would sit upon my
linger, and lay his bill close to my face, and
cry, " Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you ?
where have you been ? how came you here ?
and such like prattle, I had constantly taught
him. But even though I knew it to be the
parrot, it was a great while before I could
adjust myself, being amazed how the creature
got thither. But now being assured it could
be no other than my honest Poll, my wonder
ceased, and reaching out my hand and calling
familiarly, "Poll," the creature came to me,
and perched upon my thumb as he was
wont, constantly prating to me with " Poor
Robinson Crusoe !" and " how did I come
here ?" and " where had I been ?" as if the
bird was overjoyed to see me; so I took
him home with me.
I was now pretty well cured of my
rambling to sea, and began to lead a very
retired life, living near a twelvemonth in a
very contented manner, wanting for nothing
except conversation. As to mechanical la-
bours, which my necessities obliged me to,
I fancied I could, upon occasion, make a
tolerable carpenter were the poor tools I had
to work with but good. Besides, as I
improved in my earthenware, I contrived
to make them with a wheel, which I found
much easier and better, making my work
shapely, which before was rude and ugly.
But I think I was never so elated with
my own performance, as for being able to
make a tobacco-pipe, which, though it was
an awkward, clumsy tiling, yet it was very
sound, and carried the smoke perfectly well.
I also improved my wicker ware, making
abundance of baskets, which were very handy
and convenient.
My powder beginning to fail, I contrived
many wTays to ensnare the goats, and see
if I could catch them alive, particularly a
she-goat with young. At last I had my
desire ; for making pitfalls and traps, baited
with barley and rice, I found one morn-
ing, in one of them, an old he-goat, and
in the other, three kids—one male and two
females. It was some time before they wTould
feed; but throwing them some sweet corn,
it so much tempted them that they began.
to be tamer. I concluded that if I designed
to furnish myself with goat's flesh when
my ammunition was spent, the tamely breed-
ing them up like a flock of sheep, about
my settlement, was the only method I could
take. I resolved to separate the wild from
the tame; and the best way for this, was
to have some enclosed piece of ground well
fenced, that those within might not break
out, or those without break in.
Such an undertaking was very great for
one pair of hands; but as there was an
absolute necessity for it, my first care was
to find a convenient piece of ground where
there was likely to be herbage for them to
eat, water to drink, and shelter to keep
them from the sun. I resolved to enclose
a piece of ground about one hundred and
fifty yards in length, and one hundred in
breadth, sufficient for as manv as would
maintain me till my flock increased, and
then 1 could add more ground. I now
vigorously prosecuted my work, and it took
me about three months to hedge in the
first piece. I tethered the three kids in
the best part of it, feeding them as near
me as possible, to make them familiar; and
indeed I very often carried some ears of
barley, or a handful of rice, and fed them
out of my hand; by which they grew so
tame that when my enclosure wTas fin-
ished and I let them loose, they would run
after me for a handful of corn. In a
year and a half's time I had a flock of
about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years after they amounted to forty-three,
besides what I had taken and killed for
my sustenance. After which I enclosed
five pieces of ground to feed them in, with
pens to drive them into, that I might
take them as I had occasion.
In this project I likewise found additional
blessings; for I not only had plenty of
goat's flesh, but milk too, which at first I
did not think of. And indeed, though I
had never milked, or seen butter or cheese
made, yet after some essays and miscarriages,
I made both, and never afterwards wanted.
How merciful can the omnipotent Power
comfort his creatures, even in the midst of
their greatest calamities ? He can sweeten
the bitterest providences, and give us reason
to magnify him in dungeons and prisons!
what a bounteous table was here spread in
a wilderness for me, where I expected no-
thing at first but to perish with hunger!
When I dined, T seemed a king, eating alone,
none daring to persume to do so till I had
done. Poll, as if he had been my principal
court favourite, was the only person permitted
to talk with me. My old, but faithful, dog
continually sat on my right hand ; while my
two cats sat on each side of the table, ex-
pecting a bit from my hand, as a mark of
my royal favour. In this manner did I live,
wanting for nothing but conversation. One
thing indeed concerned me, the want of my
boat; I knew not which way to get her
round the island. One time I resolved to
go along the shore by land to her; but had
any one in England met with such a figure,
it would either have affrighted them, or
made them, burst into laughter.
The cap I wore on my head was great,
high, and shapeless, made of a goat's skin,
with a flap or pent-house hanging down be-
hind, not only to keep the sun from me,
but to shoot the rain off, nothing being more
pernicious than the rain falling upon the
flesh in these climates. I had a short jacket
of goat-skin, whose hair hung down such
a length on each side, that it reached to
the calves of my legs. As for my shoes
and stockings, they were made like buskins,
and laced on the sides like spatterdashes,
barbarously shaped like the rest of my habit.
K
I had a broad belt of goat's skin dried, girt
round me with a couple of thongs, instead
of buckles; on each of which, to supply the
deficiency of sword and dagger, hung my
hatchet and saw. Another belt not so broad,
yet fastened in the same manner, hung over
my shoulder, and at the end of it, under
my left arm, two pouches, made of goat-skin,
to hold powder and shot. My basket I
carried on my back, and my gun on my
shoulder; and over my head a great, clumsy,
ugly goat-skin umbrella, which however, next
to my gun, was the most necessary thing
about me. As for my face, the colour was
not quite so swarthy as the Mulattoes, as
might have been expected from one who
took so little care of it, in a climate within
nine or ten degrees of the equator, At one
time my beard grew so long that it hung
down about a quarter of a yard; but as
1 had both razors and scizzors in store,
I cut it all off, and suffered none to grow,
except a large pair of Mahometan wiskers,
like what I had seen worn by some Turks
at Salee, not long enough indeed to hang
a hat upon, but of such a monstrous size
as would have amazed any Englishman
I had now two plantations in the island ;
the first my little fortification, with many
large and spacious improvements. The piles
with which I made my wall were grown
so lofty and great, as secured my habitation.
And near this commodious and pleasant
settlement, lay my well-cultivated and im-
proved corn fields, which yielded me their
fruit in proper season. My second planta-
tion wTas that near my country seat, or
little bower, where my grapes flourished,
and where, having planted many stakes, I
made enclosures tor my goats, so strongly
fortified by labour and time, that it was
much stronger than a wall, and consequently
impossible from them to break through. As
for my bower itself, I kept it constantly in
repair, and cut the trees in such a manner,
as made them grow thick and form a de-
lightful shade. In the centre of this stood
my tent: I had driven four piles in the
ground, spreading over it a piece of the
ship's sail; beneath which I made a sort of
a couch with the skins of the creatures I
had slain; and having laid thereon one of
the sailor's blankets, which I had saved from
the wreck, and covering myself with a great
watch-coat, I took up this place for my
country retreat.
97
 ONE day it
happened, that
going to my
boat, I saw the
•jz—r^ print of a man's
naked foot on
the shore, very evident on the sand, as the
toes, heel, and every part of it. Had I seen
an apparition of the most frightful shape,
I could not have been more confounded.
My willing ears gave the strictest attention.
I cast my eyes around, but could satisfy nei-
ther the one nor the other. I proceeded
alternately to every part of the shore, but
with equal effect; neither could I see any
K 3
other mark, though the sand about it was
as susceptible to take impression as that
which was so plainly stamped. Thus, struck
with confusion and horror, I returned to my
habitation frightened at every bush and tree,
taking everything for men, and possessed
with the wildest ideas. That night my eyes
never closed : I formed nothing but the most
dismal imaginations; all my religious hopes
vanished, as though I thought God would
not now protect me by his power, who had
wonderfully preserved me so long,
"What various changes of Providence are
there in the life of a man ! How changeable
are our affections, according to different cir-
cumstances ! We love to-day what we hate
to-morrow; we shun one hour what we seek
the next. This was evident in me in the
most conspicuous manner; for I, who had
before so much lamented my condition, in
being banished from all human kind, was
now, even ready to expire, when 1 consi-
dered that a man had set his foot on this
desolate island. But when I considered my
station of life, decreed by the infinitely wise
and good providence of God, I found it my
duty to trust severely in him, pray ardently
to him, and humbly resign myself to his
divine will.
One morning, lying on my bed, these
words of the sacred writings came into my
mind: " Call upon me in the day of trouble,
and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glo-
rify me." Upon this sentence, rising more
cheerfully from my bed, I offered up my
prayers in the most heavenly manner; and
when I had done, taking up my Bible to
read, these words appeared first in my
sight : " Wait on the Lord, and be of good
cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart :
Wait, I say, on the Lord." Such divine
comfort did this give me, as to remove all
cause of sadness upon that occasion.
I ventured out of my castle and milked
my goats, one of which was almost spoiled
for want of it. I next, though in great
fear, visited my bower, and milked my
flocks there also; when, growing bolder, I
went down to the shore again, and measur-
ing the print of the foot to mine, to see
perhaps whether I myself had not occasioned
that mark, I found it much superior in
largeness; and so returned home, now ab-
solutely convinced that either some men had
been ashore, or that the island must be in-
habited, and therefore that I might be sur-
prised before I was aware.
I began to think of providing for my
security, and resolved in my mind many dif-
ferent schemes for that purpose. I first
proposed to cut down my enclosures, and
turn my tame cattle wild into the woods,
that the enemy might not find them, and
frequent the islands in the hopes of killing
the same. Secondly, I was for digging up
ivy corn-fields for the very same reason,
And lastly, I concluded to demolish my bower,
lest, seeing a place of human contrivance,
they might come farther, and find me out,
and attack me in my little castle.
Such notions did the fear of danger sug-
gest to me; and I looked, I thought, like
the unfortunate king Saul, when not only
oppressed by the Phillistines, but also for-
saken by God. And, it is strange, that a
little before, having entirely resigned myself
to the will of God, L should now have little
confidence in him, fearing those more who
could kill this fading body, than him who
could destroy my immortal soul.
Wandering one day more to the west of
the island than ever I had yet done, and
casting my eyes towards the sea, methought,
I perceived a boat at a great distance, but
could not possibly tell what it was for want
of my perspective glass. I considered then
it was no strange thing to see the print of
a man's foot: and concluding them canni-
bals, blessed God for being cast on the
other side of the island, where none of
the savages, as I thought, ever came. But
when I came down the hill to the shore,
which was the S. W. point of the island, I
was confirmed in my opinion ; nor can any
one describe my horror and amazement when
I saw the ground spread with skulls, hands,
feet, and bones of human bodies ; and, par-
ticularly, I perceived a space like a circle, in
the midst of which had been a fire, about
which I conjectured these wretches sat, and
unnaturally sacrificed and devoured their fel-
low-creatures.
The horror and loathsomeness of this
dreadful spectacle, confounded my senses. I
returned towards my habitation, and in my
way thither, shedding floods of tears, and
falling down on my knees, gave God thanks
for making my nature contrary to these
wretches, and delivering me so long out of
their hands.
Though reason and my long residence
here had assured me that these savages ne-
ver came up to the thick, woody part of the
country, and that I had no reason to be ap-
prehensive of a discovery; yet such an ab-
horrence did I still retain that, for two
years after, I confined myself only to my
plantations. In progress of time my dread-
ful apprehensions began to wear away, yet
I was more vigilant for fear of being sur-
prised, and very cautious of firing my gun,
lest being heard by those creatures, they
should proceed to attack me. I resolved,
however, manfully to lose my life if they
did, and went armed with three pistols
stuck to my girdle, which gave me a very
formidable appearance.
 Y circumstances for
some time remained ve-
ry calm and undistur-
bed ; and when I com-
^/^-is^^r pared my condition with
others, I found it far from being miserable.
Would all persons compare their circumstan-
ces, not with those above them, but with
those innumerable unhappy objects beneath
them, I am sure we should not hear those
daily murmurings and complainings that are
in the world. The terror which the savages
had put me in, spoiled some inventions for
my own convenience. For now my inven-
tions were how I might destroy some of
these cannibals, when proceeding to their
bloody entertainments; and so saving a vic-
tim from being sacrificed, that he might
after become ray servant. To put my design
into execution, I was not long in seeking
a place convenient for my purpose, where
unseen I might behold every action of the
savages. Here I placed my two muskets,
each of which was loaded with a brace f
slugs, and four or five smaller bullets, about
the size of pistol bullets; the fowling-piece
was charged with near a handful of the larg-
est swan-shot, and in every pistol was about
four bullets. But having waited in vain two
or three months, it not only grew very tire-
some .to me, but brought me to some con-
sideration, and made me examine what right
I had to kill these creatures in this man-
ner. Indeed, religion took their part so
much, as to convince me how contrary it
was to my duty, to be guilty of shedding
human blood, innocent as to me, whatever
they are to one another; that I had nothing
to do with it, but leave it to the God of
ail power and dominion, to do therein what
L
seemed convenient to his heavenly wisdom.
And on my knees I thanked the Almighty
for delivering me from blood-guiltiness, and
begged his protection, that I might never fall
into their hands. Thus giving over an at-
tempt which I had rashly begun, I never
ascended the hill on that occasion afterwards,
only removed my boat, which lay on the
other side of the island, and every thing
that belonged to her, towards the east,
a little cove, that there might not be the
least shadow of any boat near, or habitation
upon the island. My castle then became
my cell, keeping always retired in it, except
when I went out to milk my goats, and
order my little flock in the wood, which was
quite out of clanger.
Anxiety of mkid for my preservation put
a period to all future inventions and con.
trivances, either for accommodation or con-
venience. I now cared not to drive a nail,
chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire,
lest either the noise should be heard, or
the smoke discover me. And on this ac-
count, I used to burn my earthenware pri-
vately, in a cave which I found in the wood,
and which I made convenient for that pur-
pose ; the principal cause that brought me
here was to make charcoal, so that I might
bake and dress my bread and meat without
any danger.
At that time, a curious accident happened
me. While I was cutting down some wood
for making my charcoal, I perceived a ca-
vity behind a very thick branch of under-
wood. Curious to look into it, I attained
its mouth, and perceived it sufficient for me
to stand upright in. But when I had en-
tered, and took a farther view, two- rolling
shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to
dart themselves at me; so that I made all
haste out that I could. When I recovered
a little from my surprise, resuming my cou-
rage, I took a flaming firebrand, and in I
l 2
ushed again. I had not proceeded above
three steps, when I was more affrighted
than before; for i heard a loud sigh, like
that of a human creature in the greatest
agony, succeeded by a broken noise resem-
bling words half-expressed, and then a sign
again. Encouraging myself with the hopes
of God's protection, I went forward, and by
the light of my firebrand, perceived it to be
a monstrous he-goat, lying on the ground,
gasping for life, and dying of mere old age.
At first I stirred him, thinking to drive him
out, and the poor creature strove to get
upon his feet, but was not able; so I e'en
let him lie still to affright the savages,
should they venture into this cave. I now
looked round and found the place small and
shapeless. At the further side of it, I per-
ceived a sort of entrance, yet so low, it must
oblige me to creep upon my hands and
knees to it; so, having no candle, I suspen-
ded my enterprise till the next day, and
then I came provided with two large ones
of my own making,
Having crept through this strait, I found
the roof, I think, about twenty feet high.
But surely mortal never saw such a glo_
rious sight before! The roofs and walls of
this cave reflected a hundred thousand lights
from my two candles, as though they were
indented with shining gold, precious stones,
or sparkling diamonds. The floor was dry
and level, and had a kind of gravel upon
it; no nauseous venomous creatures to be
seen there, neither any damp or wet about
it. I could find no fault but in the en-
trance, and I began to think that even this
might be very necessary for my defence,
and therefore resolved to make it my prin-
cipal magazine. I brought hither two fowl-
ing-pieces and three muskets, leaving only
five pieces in my castle, planted in the na-
ture of cannon. Of the barrel of gunpowder
which I took up out of the sea, I brought
l 3
away about sixty pounds, which was not
damaged ; and this, with a great quantity of
lead for bullets, I removed from my castle
to this retreat, now fortified both by art
and nature.
I fancied myself now like one of the gi-
ants of old, who were said to live in caves
and holes among the rocks, inaccessible to
any but themselves; or, at least, a most
dangerous attempt. And now I despised
both the cunning and strength of the sa-
vages, either to find me out, or to hurt
me.
But I must not forget the old goat, which
caused my late dreadful amazement. The
poor creature gave up the ghost the day
after my discovery; and it being difficult to
drag him out, I dug his grave, and hon-
ourably entombed him in the same place
where he departed, with as much ceremony
as any Welch goat that had been interred
about the high mountains of Penmanmawr.
I think I now was in the twenty-third
year of my reign, and my thoughts much
easier than formerly, having contrived seve-
ral pretty amusements and diversions agree-
ably to pass away the time. By this time
my pretty Poll had learned to speak En-
glish, and pronounce his words very arti-
culately and plain; so that .for many hours
we used to chat together in a familiar man-
ner, and he lived with me no less than
twenty-six years. My dog, which was
nineteen years old, sixteen of which he lived
with me, died some time ago of mere old
age. As for my cats they multiplied so
fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them
into the woods, except two or three which
became my particular favourites. Besides
these, I continually kept two or three house-
hold kids about me, which I learned to feed
out of my hand, and two more parrots
which could talk indifferently, and call Ros
binson Crusoe. I had also several sea-fowl-
which I had wounded and cut their wings;
and growing tame, they used to breed
among the low trees about my castle walls,
all which made my abode very agreeable.
But what unforeseen events suddenly des-
troy the enjoyment of this uncertain life! It
was now the month of December, in the
southern solstice, and time of my harvest,
which required my attendance in the fields;
when going out pretty early one morning,
before it was light, there appeared from the
sea-shore a flaming light, about two miles
from me, at the east end of the island,
where I had observed some savages had
been before, not on the other side, bat, to
my great affliction, it was on my side the
island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my
usual apprehensions, that the savages would
perceive my improvements, I returned di-
rectly to my castle, pulled the ladder after
me, making all things look as wild and na-
tural as I possibly could. In the next place
I put myself in a posture of defence, loaded
my muskets and pistols, and committed
myself to God's protection, resolved to de-
fend myself till my last breath. Two hours
after, impatient for intelligence, I ascended
to the top of a hill, where, laying myself
down, with my perspective-glass, I per-
ceived no less than nine naked savages,
sitting round a small fire, eating, as I sup-
posed, human flesh, with their two canoes
hauled on shore, waiting for the flood to
carry them off again. I cannot easily ex-
press the consternation I was in at this
sight; but when I perceived their coming
must be always with the current of the ebb,
I became more easy, being fully convinced
that I might go abroad with security all the
time of flood, if they were not before land-
ed. Before they went off, they danced
making ridiculous postures and gestures, for
above an hour, all stark-naked. When I
saw them gone, I took two guns upon my
shoulders, and placing a couple of pistols
in my belt, with my great sword hanging
by my side, I went to the hill, where at
first 1 made the discovery of these canni-
bals, and then saw there had been three
canc-es more of the savages on shore at
that place, which with the rest were mak-
ing over to the main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me,
when going to the place of sacrifice, the
blood, the bones, and other mangled parts
of human bodies appeared in my sight; and
so fired was I with indignation, that I was
fully resolved to be revenged on the first
that came there, though I lost my life in
the execution. It then appeared to me, that
the visits which they make to this island
are not very frequent, it being fifteen months
before they came again : but still I was very
uneasy lest they should surprise me unawares.
On the 16th of May (according to my
wooden calendar) the wind blew exceedingly
hard, accompanied with abundance of light-
ning and thunder all day, and succeeded
by a very stormy night. The seeming anger
of the Heavens made me have recourse to
my Bible. Whilst I was seriously pondering
upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the
noise of a gun, which I conjectured was fired
upon the ocean. Such an unusual surprise
made me start up in a minute, when, with
my ladder, ascending the mountain as before,
that very moment a flash of fire presaged
the report of another gun, which I presently
heard, and found it was from that part of
the sea where the current drove me away.
I could not but think that this must be a
ship in distress, and that these were the
melancholy signals for a speedy deliverance.
Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon this
occasion; but my labours to assist them
must have proved fruitless. However, I
brought together all the dry wood that was
at hand, and making a pretty large pile,
set it on fire on the hill. I was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their firing
another gun as soon as it began to blaze,
and after that several more from the same
quarter. All night long I kept up my fire;
and when the air cleared up, I perceived
something a great way at sea, directly east,
but could not distinguish what it was, even
with my glass, as the weather was very
foggy out at sea. However, keeping my
eyes directly fixed upon it, and perceiving
it did not stir, I presently concluded it
must be a ship at anchor; and taking the
gun, I went to the S.E. part of the island,
to the same rocks where I had been formerly
driven by the current; in which time the
weather being perfectly cleared up, to my
great sorrow I perceived the wreck of a ship
cast away upon those hidden rocks.
I had the affliction, some time after, to
see the corpse of a drowned boy come on
shore, at the end of the island which was
next the wreck; there was nothing on him
but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt,
but no particular mark to guess what nation
he was of. In his pocket were two pieces
of eight, and a tobacco-pipe. And now the
calmness of the sea tempted me to venture
out in my boat to this wreck, not only to
get something necessary out of the ship, but
perhaps some living creature might be on
board, whose life I might preserve. This
had such an influence upon my mind, that
immediately I went home, and prepared every
thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on
board my boat, provisions of all sorts, with
a good quantity of rum, fresh water, and a
compass: so putting off, I paddled the canoe
along the shore, till I came at last to the
north-east part of the island, from whence
I was to launch into the ocean; but here
the currents ran so violently, and appeared
so terrible, that my heart began to fail me:
foreseeing, that if I was driven into any of
these currents, I might be carried not only
out of the reach of the island, but even
inevitably lost in the boiling surges of the
ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that
I gave over my enterprise, sailing to a little
creek^ on the shore, where stepping out, I
sat down on a rising hill, very pensive and
thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide
was turned, and the flood came on, which
made it impracticable for me to go out for
many hours.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe,
covered with my watch-coat instead of a
blanket, the heavens being my tester. I
set out with the first of the tide full north,
till I felt the benefit of the current, which
carried me at a great rate eastward, yet not
with such impetuosity as before, as to take
from me all government of my canoe; so
that in two hours' time I came up to the
wreck. It seemed to be a Spanish vessel, .
stuck fast between two rocks; her stern and
quarter beaten to pieces by the sea; her
mainmast and foremast were broken off
short. As I approached near, I perceived
a dog on board, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried, and no sooner did I call
him, but the poor creature jumped into the
sea, out of which I took him up, almost
famished with hunger and thirst; so that
when I gave him a cake of bread, no raven-
ous wolf could devour it more greedily;
and he drank to that degree of fresh water,
that he would have burst himself, had j
suffered him.
The first sight I met with in the ship
were two men drowned in the cook-room
or forecastle, enclosed in one another's arms;
hence I very probably supposed, that when
the vessel struck in the storm, so high and
incessantly did the waters break in and over
m 2
her, that the men, not being able to bear
it, were strangled by the constant rushing
in of the waves. There were several casks of
liquor, whether wine or brandy I could not
be positive, which lay in the lower hold, as
were plainly preceptible by the ebbing out of
the water, yet were too large for me to pretend
to meddle with: likewise I perceived several
chests, which I supposed to belong to the
seamen, two of which I got into my boat,
without examining what was in them.
Searching further, I found a cask, con-
taining about twenty gallons of liquor, which
with some labour, I got into my boat: in
her cabin were several muskets, which I let
remain there, but took away with me a
great powder-horn, with about four pounds
of powder. I took also a fire-shovel and
tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to
make chocolate, and a gridiron, aii 01 which
were extremely useful to me, especially the
fire-shovel and tongs. And so with this
cargo, accompanied by my dog, I came away,
the tide serving for that purpose: and the
same evening I attained the island, after the
greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my weary limbs in
the boat, resolving the next morning to
harbour what I had gotten in my new-
found subterraneous grotto; and not to
carry my cargo home to my ancient castle.
Having refreshed myself, and got all my
effects on shore, I next proceeded to ex-
amine them ; and tapping the cask, I found
the liquor to be rum. In the chest I found
very fine case of bottles, containing the
finest and best sorts of cordial water; each
bottle held about three pints, curiously tipt
with silver. Also, two pots full of the
choicest sweetmeats, and two more which
the water had utterly spoiled. There were
likewise several good shirts, exceedingly
welcome to me; and about one dozen and
half white linen handkerch efs, and coloured
m 3
neckcloths, the former of which was abso-
lutely necessary for wiping my face on a
hot day : and in the till I found three
bags of pieces of eight, about eleven hun-
dred in all, in one of which, decently
wrapped up in a piece of paper, were six
doubloons of gold, and some small bars
and wedges of the same metal, which I
believed might weigh near a pound. In the
other chest, which I guessed to belong to
the gunner's mate, I found only some
clothes of very little value, except about
two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three
flasks, kept, as I believe, for charging the
fowling-pieces ; so that, in the whole, I had
no great advantage by this voyage. The
money was, indeed, as mere dirt to me,
useless and unprofitable, all which 1 would
have freely parted with for two or three
pair of English shoes and stockings; things
that for many years I had not worn, except
thoee which I had taken off the feet of
the unfortunate men I found drowned in
the wreck. When I arrived at my castle,
everything seemed safe and quiet.
Having retired to my castle after my
late voyage to the ship, my frigate laid up
and secured, as usual, and my condition the
same as before, except being richer, though
1 had as little occasion for riches as the
Indians of Peru had for gold, before the
cruel Spaniards came among them; one
night in March, being the rainy season,
in the four-and-twentieth year of my solitude,
I lay down to sleep, very well in health,
without distemper, pain, or uncommon un-
easiness, either of body or mind, yet,
notwithstanding, I could not compose myself
to sleep. All this tedious time, it is
impossible to express what innumerable
thoughts came into my head, I traced the
whole history of my life in miniature, from
my earliest remembrance of things till I
came to this island, and then proceeded to
examine everything that had occurred since
I had taken possession of my kingdom.
In my reflections upon the latter, I was
comparing the happy posture of my affairs
in the beginning of my reign, to this life
of anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had
discovered a print of a foot in the sand.
While my thoughts were agitated, my re-
signation to the will of Heaven was entirely
suspended, so that I had no power to fix
my mind to anything, but to the project
of a voyage to the main land : till nature
being, as it were, fatigued and exhausted
with the thoughts of it, made me submit
myself to a silent repose.
In such a situation, it is very strange that
did not dream of what I was so intent
upon; but instead of it, my mind roved on
a thing altogether foreign. I dreamed that
as I was issuing from my castle one morn-
ing, as customary, I perceived upon the
shore two canoes, eleven savages coming to
land, who had brought with them another
Indian, whom they designed to make a
sacrifice of, in order to devour; but just as
they were going to give the fatal blow me-
thought the poor victim jumped away, and
ran directly into my little thick grove, to
abscond from his enemies, when, perceiving
that the others did not follow him, I appear-
ed to him; that he humbly kneeled down
before me, and seemed to pray for my
assistance; upon which I showed him my
ladder, made him ascend, carried him to my
cave, and he became my servant.
This dream brought me to reflect, that
one sure way of escaping was to get a
savage; that after I had ventured my life to
deliver him from the bloody jaws of his
devourers, the natural sense he might have
of such a preservation, might inspire him
with a las-ting gratitude, and most sincere
affection. I at length resolved, right or
wrong, to get one of these savages into my
hands, .even though I should lose my life
in the attempt. Inspired by this resolution,
I set my wits at work, to find out what
methods I should take to accomplish my
design; this, indeed, was so difficult a task,
that I could not pitch upon any probable
means to execute it: I therefore resolved
continually to be in a vigilant posture, to
perceive when the savages came on shore,
and to leave the rest to the event.
Such was my fixed resolutions; and ac-
cordingly I set myself upon the watch. I
waited for above a year and a half. This
was a very great discouragement! yet the
edge of my design was as keen as ever, and
the longer it seemed to be delayed, the
more eager was I for it.
I was one day seriously musing how I
should attain my end, when I was very
much surprised by seeing no less than five
canoes all on shore together, on my side of
the island, and the savages that belonged
 n
ip
to them all landed, and out of my sight.
Such a number of them disconcerted my
measures; for, seeing so many boats, each
of which would contain six and sometimes
more. I could not tell how to order my
measures; and much dispirited and perplexed,
I lay still in my castle; which, however,
I put in a proper posture for an attack,
and having formerly provided all that was
necessary, was soon ready to enter upon an
engagement. Having waited for some time,
my impatient temper would let me bear it
no longer; I set my guns at the foot of the
ladder, and as usual, ascended to the top of
the hill; and here, by the assistance of my
perspective-glass, I observed no less than
thirty in number around a fire, feasting upon
what meat they had dressed; how they
cooked it, or what it was, I could not then
perfectly tell; but they were all dancing
and capering about the flames, using many
frightful and barharous gestures.
But while, with a curious eye, I was
beholding these wretches, my spirits sunk
within me, when 1 perceived them drag two
miserable creatures from the boats, to act
afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed
they had done before. It was not long
before one of them fell upon the ground,
knocked down, as I suppose with a club or
wooden sword; while two or three others
went immediately to work, cutting him open
for their cookery, while the last unhappy
captive was left by himself, till they were
ready for him. The poor creature looked
around him with a wishful eye, trembling at
the thoughts of death; yet seeing himself
a little at liberty, nature that very moment,
as it were, inspired him with hopes of life:
he started away from them, and ran, with
incredible swiftness, along the sands, directly
to that part of the coast where my ancient
and venerable castle stood.
You may well imagine I was dreadfully
affrighted upon this occasion. However, my
spirits beginning to recover, I still kept
upon my guard; and I now plainly per-
ceived there were but three men out of the
number that pursued him. I was infinitely
pleased to see with what swiftness the poor
creature ran from his pursuers, gaining so
much ground upon them, that I plainly per-
ceived, could he thus hold out for half an
hour, there was not the least doubt but he
would save his life from the power „of his
enemies.
Between them and my castle there was
a creek, where I much feared the poor
victim would be taken, if he could not swim
for his escape. But soon was I out of pain
for him, when I perceived he made nothing
of it, though at full tide, but with an in-
trepid courage, spurred on by the sense
of danger, he plunged into the flood, swim-
ming over in about thirty strokes, and then
landing, ran with the same incredible strength
N
and swiftness as before. When the three
pursuers came to the creek, one of them,
who I perceived could not swim, returned
to his company, while the others, with
equal courage, but much less swiftness, at-
tained the other side, as though they were
resolved never to give over the pursuit.
And now or never, I thought, was the time
for me to procure me a servant, companion,
or assistant. I immediately descended my
two ladders with the greatest expedition;
took up my guns, which, as I said
before, were at the bottom of them, and
taking a short cut down the hill I
interposed between the pursuers and pur-
sued ; hallowing aloud to the latter, who
venturing to look back, was, no doubt, as
much terrified at me as I at them. I
beckoned to him with my hand, to return
back; in the mean time advancing towards
the pursuers, and rushing on the foremost
I knocked him down with the stock of my
piece, and laid him fiat on the ground. I
was very unwilling to fire, lest the rest
should hear. The other savage seeing his
fellow fall, stopped as if he had been
amazed; when, advancing towards him, I
could perceive him take his bow from his
back, and fixing his arrow to it, was pre-
paring to shoot at me. In this case o
self-preservation, I immediately fired at him,
and shot him dead, just as his hand was
going to draw the fatal string. All this
while the savage, who had fled before,
stood still, and had the satisfaction to see
his enemies killed; so affrighted was he
with the fire and noise of my piece, that
he stood fixed and immovable, without
either sense or motion. This obliged me
to halloo to him again, making the plainest
signs I could to him to draw nearer. I
perceived he understood those tokens by his
approaching to me a little way, when, as if
afraid I should kill him too, he stopped
n 2
again. Several times did he advance, and
as often stop in this manner, till coming
more to my view, I perceived him trembling,
as if he was to undergo the same fate;
upon which I looked upon him with a
smiling countenance, and still beckoning to
him, at length he came close to me, and
kneeled down, kissing the ground, laid
his head upon it, and taking me by the foot,
set it upon his head; and this, as I under-
stood afterwards, was a token of swearing
to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and, making much of him, encouraged him
in the best manner I could. But my work
was not yet finished; for I perceived the sa-
vage whom I had knocked down was not
killed, but stunned with the blow, and began
to come to himself. Upon which I pointed to
my new servant, and showed him that his
enemy had not yet expired: he spoke some
words to me, but which I could not under-
stand : yet being the first sound of a man's
voice that I had heard for above twenty -
five years, they were very pleasing to me.
But there was no time for reflection now,
the wounded savage recovering himself so
far as to sit upon the ground, which made
my poor prisoner as much afraid as before.
To put him out of fear, I presented my
other gun at the man, with an intent to
shoot him; but my savage, for so I must
now call him, prevented my firing, by ma-
king a motion to me to lend him a sword,
which hung naked in my belt by mv side,
No sooner did I grant his request than
away he ran to his enemy, and at one blow
cut off his head as dexterously as the most
accomplished executioneer in Germany could
have done; for it seems these creatures
make use of wooden swords, made of hard
wood, which will bear edge enough to cut
off heads and arms at one blow. When
this valorous exploit was done, he comes to
me laughing, as a token of triumph, de-
n 3
livered me my sword again, with abundance
of surprising gestures, laying it, along with
the bleeding and ghastly head of the In-
dian, at my feet.
The great astonishment that my new ser-
vant conceived, was the manner of killing
the savage at such a distance, without a
bow and arrow. First he turned him on
one side, then on another, wondering he
could perceive no quantity of blood; and
after sufficiently admiring the wound the
bullets had made in his breast, he took up
his bow and arrows, and came back again;
upon which I turned to go away, making
signs to him to follow, lest the rest, missing
their companions, might come in pursuit of
them: and this I found he understood very
well, by his making me understand that his
design was to bury them, that they might
not be seen if it happened, and which I
made him sensible I very much approved of.
Immediately he fell to work, and never was
a grave-digger more dexterous than he was;
for in an instant he scraped a large hole in
the sand with his hands, sufficient to bury
the first in; there he dragged him, and
without any ceremony he covered him over;
in like manner he served the other: all this
was done in less than a quarter of an hour.
I then called him away, and instead of
carrying him directly to my castle, I con-
veyed him to my cave on the farther part
of the island: and so my dream was now
fulfilled in that particular, that - my grove
should prove an asylum or sanctuary to him.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of
raisins to eat, and water to drink; on which
he fed very cheerfully, to his exceeding
refreshment. I then made him a bed with
a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon
it, and pointing to it, made signs for him to
lie down to sleep; upon which the poor crea-
ture went to take a welcome repose.
Indeed he was a very handsome young
fellow, extremely well made, with straight
long limbs, not too large, but tall and well-
shaped, and, as near as I could reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. His coun-
tenance had nothing in it fierce or surly,
but rather a sort of majesty, and especially
when he smiled, he had all the sweetness
and softness of an European. His hair was
not curled like wool, as many of the blacks
are, but long and black, with the most
beautiful yet careless tresses spreading over
his shoulders. He had a very high and
large forehead, with a great vivacity and
sparkling sharpness in his eyes. His skin
was not so tawny as the Virginian Brazil-
ians, or other Americans, but rather of a
bright dun olive-colour, that had something
agreeable in it, though not very easy to
describe. His face was round and plump,
with a small nose, very different from the
flatness of the negroes, a pretty small
mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well set,
and white as the driven snow. In a word,
such handsome features, and exact symme-
try in every part, made me consider that
I had saved the life of an Indian prince.
As I understood him in many things, I
made him sensible I was very well pleased
with him ; and in a little time, I began to
speak to him, and taught him to talk to me
again. In the first place I made him under-
stand his name was to be Friday, because it
was upon that day I saved his life; then I
taught him to say Master, which I made him
sensible was to be my name. I likewise taught
him to say Yes and No, and to know what
they meant. I gave him some milk in an
earthen pot, making him view me wThile I
drank it before him, and soaked my bread
in it; I gave him a cake of bread, and
caused him to soak it likewise, to which he
readily consented, making signs of the great-
est satisfaction.
All that night 1 kept hini there; but in
the morning I ordered him to arise, and
come along with me, with certain tokens
that I would give him some clothes like
mine, at which he seemed very glad being
stark-naked.
I carried him with me to my castle, and
gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I
had taken out of the poor gunner's chest
and which, with a little alteration, fitted
him very well: in the next place I made
him a jerkin of goat's skin, such as my skill
was able to manage; and indeed I thought
myself then a tolerable good tailor. I gave
him also a cap which I had made of a hare's
skin, very convenient and fashionable. Thus
being clothed tolerably well, my man was
no less proud of his habit than I was of
seeing him in it. Indeed he went very
awkwardly at first, the drawers being heavy
on his thighs, not used to bear any weight,
and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his
shoulders and the inside of his arms; but
by a little easing where he complained they
hurt him, and by using himself to them
at length he took to them very well.
My next concern was where I should
lodge him; and that I might do well by
him, and yet be perfectly easy myself. I
erected a tent for him in the vacant place
between my two fortifications, in the inside
of the last and the outside of the first, and
as there was an entrance or door into my
cave, I made a formal framed doorcase,
and a door to open on the inside; I barred
it up in the night-time, taking in my ladders
too, so that, was my man to prove treach-
erous, there could be no way to come at
me in the inside of my innermost wall, with-
out making so much noise hi getting over
that it must awaken me.
But there was no occasion for this pre-
caution ; for surely a master never had a
more sincere, faithful, and loving servant
than my Friday proved to me. Without
passion, sullenness, or design, perfectly oblig-
ing and engaging, his affections were as much
tied to me as those of a child to its parents;
and I might venture to say, he would have
sacrificed his life for the saving of mine,
upon any occasion whatsoever.
One morning I took him out with me,
with an intention to kill a kid out of the
flock, and bring it home and dress it. As
I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying
down in the shade, and two young kids
sitting by her. Immediately I catched hold
of my man Friday, and bidding him stand
still and not stir, I presented my piece, and
shot one of the kids. My poor servant,
who at a distance perceived me kill his
adversary, and yet did not know by what
means, or how it was done, stood trembling
and surprised, and looked so amazed, that
I thought he would have sunk into tne
earth. He did not see the kid I aimed at,
or behold I had killed it, but ripped up his
waistcoat to see if he was not wounded,
thinking my intention was to kill him; for
coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnest-
ly pronouncing many things which I did not
understand the meaning of; which at length
I perceived was, that I would not take away
his life. - To convince him that I would
do him no harm, I took him smiling by the
hand, then laughing at him, and pointing to
the kid which I had slain, made signs to
him to fetch it, which accordingly he did.
He would not so much as touch the gun
for several days after, but would come and
communicate his thoughts to it, and talk
to it, as if the senseless piece had under-
stood and answered him ; all this I could
perceive him do when he thought my back
was turned, the chief intent of which wa9,
to desire it not to kill him, as I afterwards
discovered.
I brought home the kid, and the same
evening took off the skin and divided the
o
carcass as well as I could. Part of the flesh
I stewed; and then spreading my table, I
sat down, giving my man some of it to eat,
who was wonderfully pleased : but what was
most surprising to him was to see me eat
salt with it: upon which he made me un-
derstand, that salt was very bad for me;
when putting a little into his mouth he
seemed to nauseate it in such a manner as
to split and splutter at it, and then washed
his mouth with fresh water. But to show
him how contrary his opinion was to mine,
I put some meat in my mouth without salt,
and feigned to spit and splutter as much for
the want of it as he had done at it: yet all
this proved of no signification to Friday:
and it was a long while before he could
endure salt in his meat or broth, and even
then but a small quantity.
Thus having fed him sufficiently with boile
meat and broth at that time, the next day
I was resolved to feast him with a roasted
piece of the kid. And having no spit to
fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I made use of
that common artifice which many of the
common people of England have; that is,
to set two poles upon each side of the fire,
and one across on the top, hanging the
meat thereon with a string, and so turning
round continually, roast it. This practice
caused great admiration in my man Friday.
But when he came to taste the sweetness
and tenderness of the flesh, he • expressed
his entire satisfaction in a thousand different
ways; and made it very plain to me, that
he would never, while he lived, eat man's
flesh more.
It was now high time I should set my
servant to work; so next day I set him to
beat out some corn, and sift it in the same
manner I had done before. And really the
fellow was very quick amd handy in the
execution of any thing I ordered him to go
about. I made him understand that it was
o 2
to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards
let him see me make it. In short, he did
every thing I ordered him in a little time,
as well as I could perform it myself.
But now, considering that I had two
mouths to feed instead of one, it was ne-
cessary that I should provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity
of corn than I used to do; upon which I
marked out a larger piece of land, fencing
it in, in • the same manner as before; in
the execution of which, I must give Friday
this good word, that no man could work
with better will than he did; and when
I made him sensible that it was for bread
to serve him as well as me, he made me
understand, that he thought I had much
more labour on his account than 1 had for
myself; and that no pains or diligence should
be wanting in him, if I would but direct
him what to do.
1 must own that this was the most plea-
sant year I ever had in the island; for
after some time Friday began to talk pretty
well, and understood the names of those
things which T was wont to call for, and
the places where I used to send him. So
that my long silent tongue, which had been
useless so many years, except in an ex-
clamatory manner, either for deliverance or
blessings, now began to be occupied in teach-
ing and talking to my man Friday; for so
innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty
appear to me, that I began entirely to love
him.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
 BELIEVE there is no
state of life but what
\Kpr may be happy, if people
would but endeavour to
make it so. lie is not the happiest man
that has the most riches ; but he that is
content with what he has. Before I had
my servant, I thought myself miserable ; and
now that I had enjoyed the happy benefits
of him, I still complained, and begged a
deliverance from a place of retirement, ease,
and plenty, where Providence had sufficiently
blessed me. In a word, from this time I
entertained some hopes, that one time or
other, I might find opportunity to make my
escape from this island, and that this poor
savage might be a great furtherance thereto.
All this time, since mv man became so
intelligent as tc understand and speak to
me, I spared no pains or diligence to in-
struct him, according to my poor share of
knowledge, in the principles of religion, and
the adoration he ought to pay to the true
God. One time, as I very well remember,
I asked him who made him! At first, the
innocent creature did not understand what
I meant, but rather thought I asked him
who was his father ? Upon which I took
another way to make him sensible. " Friday,"
said I, " who is it that made the sea, this
ground, whereon we walk, and all these
hills and woods which we behold ?" and here
indeed I did not miss my intention ; for he
told me it was Old Benamuckee, (the god
whom I supposed these savages adored,)
who lived a great way beyond all. But as
to his attributes, poor Friday was an utter
stranger. He could describe nothing of this
great person; and all that he could sav
was, that he was verv old, much older than
the sea and land, the moon, or the stars.
" Friday," said I again, " if this great and old
person has made all things in the world,
how comes it to pass, that all things, as
you in particular, do not adore and worship
him ?" Upon this, looking very grave, with
a perfect sweet look of innocence, he re-
plied, "Master, all things say O to him;"
by which it may be reasonably supposed he
meant adoration. "And where," said I, "do
the people of your country go when they
die ?" He answered to Benamuckee. " What,
and those people that are eaten up, do they
go there?" "Benamuckee," said he, "love
'em dearly; me pray to Benamuckee in de
canoe, and Benamuckee would love me when
they eat me all up."
Such discourses as these had I with my
man, which made me sensible, that the
true God is worshipped, though under
imperfect similitudes; and that the false
adoration which the heathens give to their
imaginary deity, is as great an argument of
the divine essence as the most learned
Atheists can bring against it: for God will
be glorified in his works, let their denomi-
nation be what it will.
I began to instruct my servant in the
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in
which the directions of God's Holy Spirit
assisted me. I lifted up my hands to
Heaven, and pointing thereto, told him,
that the great Maker of heaven and earth
lived there : that, as his infinite power
fashioned this world out of a confused chaos,
and made it in that beautiful frame which
we behold, so he governs and preserves it
by his unbounded knowledge, sovereign great-
ness, and peculiar providence; that he was
omnipotent, could do every thing for us,
give every thing to us, and take every
thing away from us: that he was the re-
warder of good and punisher of evil actions;
that there was nothing but what he knew,
no thoughts so secret but what he could
bring to light, and thus by degrees, I
opened his eyes, and described to him the
manner of the creation of the world, the
situation of paradise, the transgression of
our first parents, the wickedness of God's
peculiar people, and the universal sins and
abominations of the whole earth. When
these things were implanted in his mind,
I told him, that as God's justice was equal
to his mercy, he resolved to destroy this
world, till his Son Jesus Christ interposed
in our behalf; and, to procure our redemp-
tion, obtained leave of his heavenly Father
to come down from Heaven into the world,
where he took human nature upon him,
instructed us in her way to eternal life, and
died as a sacrifice for our sins; that he
was now ascended into Heaven, mediating
for our pardon, delivering our petitions, and
obtaining all those benefits which we ask
in his name, by humble and hearty prayers,
151
all which were heard at the throne of Heaven.
By the constant application I made to the
Scriptures, as I read them to my man
Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to make
him understand every part of it, as much
as lay in my power. He also, on the other
hand, by his very serious questions and
enquiries, made me a much better proficient
in Scripture knowledge than I should have
been by my own private reading and study.
You may well suppose, that by the fre-
quent discourse we had together, my man
and I became most intimately acquainted,
and that there was but very little I could
say but what Friday understood; indeed he
spoke very fluently, though it was but
broken English.
I gave him a very particular description
of the territories of Europe, and in a par-
ticular manner of Old England, the place
of my nativity. I laid before him the
manner of our worshipping God, our be-
haviour one to another, and how we trade
in ships to every part of the universe. I
then told him my misfortunes in being ship-
wrecked ; I brought him to the ruins of my
boat, which before my whole strength could
not move, but now was almost rotten and
fallen to pieces. I observed my man Friday
viewed this boat with uncommon curiosity;
when he had done, he stood pondering a
great while, but said nothing. At last I
said, " Friday, what makes you ponder so ?"
He replied, " O master, me see like boat
come to place at my nation."
It was sometime before I understood what
my man meant; but examining strictly into
it, I plainly found, that a boat resembling
mine, had come upon the country where he
dwelt. It then came into my mind, that
some European ship having been cast away,
the poor distressed creatures were forced to
have recourse to the boat to save their lives;
and being all, as I thought, drowned, 1
never concerned myself to ask anything con-
cerning them, but my only enquiry was
about the boat, and what description my
man could give of it.
Indeed, Friday answered my demands very
well, making every thing very plain to my
understanding: but beyond measure was I
satisfied, when he told me, with great warmth
and ardour, " O master, we save white mans
from drown :" upon which I immediately
asked him, if there were any white mans,
as he called them in the boat ? " Yes, yes,"
said he, "the boat full, very full of white
mans." €t How many, Friday ?" said I. Here-
upon he numbered his fingers, and counted
seventeen. And when I asked him what
became of them all, and whether they lived
or not ? he replied, " Yes, master, they all
live; they be live among my nation." This
information put fresh thoughts into my head,
that these must be those very men who be-
fore I concluded had been swallowed up in
the ocean, after they had left the ship that
had struck upon the rocks of my kingdom,
and after escaping the fury of the deep,
landed upon a wild shore, and committed
themselves to the fury of the devouring
Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one ano-
ther, which, consequently, as I thought, must
be acted with great barbarity to strangers,
created in me great anxiety, and made me
still more curious to ask Friday concerning
them. He told me, he was sure they still
lived there, having resided among them above
four years, and that the savages gave them
victuals to live upon. " But pray, Friday,"
said I, " whence proceeded all this good na-
ture and generosity ? How came it to pass
that they did not kill and eat them ?" " No,
no," said Friday; "they not kill 'em, they
make brothers with 'em." I had a more fa-
vourable opinion of the Indians upon Friday
uttering these words—" Mv nation, t'other
nation, no eats mans but when mans make
war-fight;" as though he said, that neither
those of his kingdom, nor any other nation
that he knew of, ever eat their fellow-creatures
but such as tbeir law of arms allowed to
be devoured; that is, those miserable captives
whose misfortune it should be to be made
prisoners of war.
Some considerable time after, upon a very
pleasant day, in most serene weather, my
man and I stood upon the top of a hill,
on the east side of the island, whence I
had once before beheld the continent of
America. I could not tell immediately what
was the matter, for suddenly Friday began
jumping and dancing as if he had been
mad; and upon my demanding the reason
of his behaviour, " O joy," said he, "O
glad! there see my country, there my na-
tion, there live white mans gether." And
indeed a rapturous sense of pleasure ap-
peared in his countenance, his eyes had an
p 2
uncommon sparkling and brightness, as if
he had a longing desire to be in his coun-
try again.
As we were walking up the same hill
another day, when the weather was so hazy
at sea, that I could not perceive the conti-
nent, " Friday/' said I, " don't you wish
yourself in your own country* among your
own friends and acquaintances ?" " Yes,"
said he, "me much o'glad to be at my own
nation/' " And what would you do there,
Friday ? Would you turn wild again, eat
man's flesh, and be as savage as you were
formerly ?" " No, no!" answered he, (full
of concern, and shaking his head;) Fri-
day now tell them to live good, tell them
pray God, tell them to eat corn, bread,
cattle, flesh, milk—no eat mans again/'
"But surely," replied I, "if you should
offer to do all this, they will kill you ; and
to manifest their contempt of such instiuc-
tion, eat you up when they have done/1
He then put on a grave, yet innocent and
smooth, countenance, saying, " No, they no
kill me, they willing love learn;" adding
withal, " that they had learned much of the
bearded mans that came in the boat." " Will
you," said I, "go back again, Friday?" He
smiled at that, and told me that he could
not swim so far." " But," said I " I will
make a canoe for you." " Yes, master," said
he, "me go if you go; me no go, if you
stay." " I go, Friday; why would you have
them to eat me up, and devour your kind
master?" "No, no," said he, "me make
them not eat master, and me make them much
love you:" and then he related to me, as well
as he was able, how exceedingly kind those
of his nation were to the white, or bearded
men, as he called them, who, in their great
calamity, were driven into their country.
It was from this time I had strong in-
clinations to venture over, and use my ut-
most efforts to join these white, bearded
p 3
men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards or
Portuguese.
Some days after, Friday and I being at
work as usual, I told him I had a boat
which I would bestow upon him, whenever
he pleased to return to his own nation ; and
to convince him of the truth of what I said,
I took him with me to the other side of
the island, where my frigate lay, and taking
it from under the water (for I always kept
it sunk for fear of a discovery,) we went
both into it to see how it would manage
on such an occasion. And really never
could any one be more dexterous in rowing
than my faithful servant, making the boat
go as fast again as I could. " Well now,
Friday/' said I, "shall we go to your so-
much-admired nation ?" But instead of meet-
ing with that cheerfulness I expected, he
looked very dull and melancholy at my say-
ing so, which indeed at first surprised me,
till be made me sensible that his concern
was about the boat bring too small to go so
far a voyage : upon which I let him under-
stand I had a much bigger; and accordingly
the next day went to the place where the
first boat lay, which I had made, when ;11
the strength I had, or art I could use,
failed in my attempt to get it into the
water. But now, it having lain in the sun
two-and-twenty years, and no care being
taken of it all that while, it became in a
manner rotten. My man told me, that such
a boat would do very well for that purpose,
sufficient to carry enough vittle, drink,
bread, for that was his manner of talking.
In short, my mind being strongly fixed
upon my designs of going over with him
to the continent, I very plainly told him,
that we would both go and make a boat
full as big, and more proportionable than
that, wherein he might safely return to his
own nation.
These words made Friday look so very
pensive, that I thought he would have
fallen at my feet. It was some time before
he could speak a word, which made me ask
him what was the matter with him ? He
replied, in a very soft and moving tone,
"What has poor Friday done? why are
you angry, mad with poor servant ? What
me done, O what me done ?" " Friday," said
I, "you never yet have offended me, what
makes you think I am angry with you,
when I am not angry at all." " You no
angry, no angry," said he several times;
" if you be no angry, why den send Friday
over great water to my own nation ?" " Why
surely, Friday," answered I, "did not you
wish to be there, when from a mountain
you beheld the place where you was born ?"
" Yes, yes," said Friday, '* me wish to be
there, sure enough, but then me wish mas-
ter there too: no wish Friday there, no
master there." In short he could not endure
the thoughts of going without me. "I go
there! Friday," said I, " what should I do
there ?" He answered very quickly, " O
master, you do great deal much good, you
teach all the wild mans to be good tame
mans: you learn dem to be sober, live good
life, to know God, and pray God." "Alas!
poor Friday," said I, "what can I do against
their priests of Benamuckee ? or indeed what
good can I make your nation sensible of,
when I myself am but a poor ignorant
man ?" " No, no, master," said he, " you
be no ignorant, you teachee me good, you
teachee dem good. " You shall go without
me, Friday," said I, " for I don't care to
accompany you thither ; I would rather live
in this solitude than venture among such
inhuman savages. Go your way, since vou
desire it, and leave me alone by myself, as
I was before I saved your life."
Never was any creature more thunder-
struck than Friday at these words. Go
me away, leave master awav," said he, after
a long silence; "no, no, Friday die, Friday
live not master gone;" as though he had
said, I neither can nor will live, if my
master sends me from him.
After I had told Friday in a very care-
less manner that he should be at liberty as
soon as the boat was made, the language
of his eyes expressed the greatest confusion;
and, immediately running to one of his
hatchets, which he used to wear as a de-
fensive weapon, he gave it into my hand,
with a heart so full, that he could scarcely
speak. " Friday," said I, " what is it you
mean ? What must I do with this ?" " Only
kill Friday," said he; " Friday care not live
long/' " But what must I kill you for?" replied
I as:ain. " Ah! dear master, what made
you Friday save from eat me up, so keep
long Friday make Friday love God, and love
not Benarauckee, and now Friday send away
never see Friday more." The tears ran
down his cheeks in such a plentiful manner
that I had much ado to refrain from weep-
ing; also. I endeavoured to comfort him
in the best manner I could, by telling him
if he was content to abide with me, I should
be ever willing to keep him.
After poor Friday's grief was somewhat
abated, more fully to convince me of his
affection, he said, " O master, me not care
to be in my nation, leave you here: me
desire nation learn good, thats all." But
as I had no apostolic mission, nor any
concern about their salvation, so I had not
the least intention or desire of undertaking
it; and the strength of my inclination, in
order to escape, proceeded chiefly from my
late discourse with Friday, about these se~
venteen white, bearded men, that had been
driven upon the barbarian coast, whom I
designed to join as the only means to fur-
ther our escape. To which intent my man
and I went to search for a proper tree to
fell, whereof we might make a large canoe,
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
to undertake the voyage; and indeed we
were not long in finding one fit for our
purpose: there being enough wood in the
island to have built a fleet of large vessels;
but the thing we principally wanted, was to
get one so near the water, that we might
launch it after it was finished, and not
commit such a mistake as I had done before.
After a great search for what was best
and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose
judgment in such affairs was much superior
to mine, pitched upon a kind of wood most
fit for it. But though my man exceeded
me in his knowledge of the most proper
tree, yet I showed him a much better and
clearer way to make a canoe than he knew
before; for he was for burning the hollow
or cavity of the tree, in order to make this
boat; but I then told him how he might
do it with tools, learning him at the same
time how to use them, which he did very
dexterously; so that in a months time we

finished it, making it very handsome, by
cutting the outside in the true shape of
a boat. After this it took us a full fort-
night before we could get her into the
water, which we did, as it was inch by inch,
upon great rollers; but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men, with
all the ease imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may
be sure, at the launching of this man-of-war
of mine, I was no less amazed to behold
with what dexterity my man would manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along. " Well
Friday," said I, "what do you think of it
now ? Do you think this will carry us over ?"
"Yes, master," said he, "me venture over
well, though great blow wind." But my
design was yet farther, which he was insen-
sible of; and that was to make a mast
and a sail, to provide her with an anchor
and cable. As to a mast, that was no
difficult thing to procure: so I fixed upon
a straight young cedar-tree, which I found
near the place, great plenty of it ahounding
in the island; and setting Friday to cut it
down, I gave him particular directions how
to shape and order it; but as to the sail,
that I managed myself. I very well knew
I had some old ones, or pieces of sails
enough, which had lain six-and-twenty years
by me,- but not being careful to preserve
them, as thinking I should have no occasion
to use them any more, when I came to
overlook them, I found them all rotten
except two; and with these I went to work,
and after a great deal of pains, and awkward
tedious stitching for want of needles, at
length I finished a three-corned ugly thing
like what we call in England a shoulder-of-
mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom,
and a little small sprit at the top, like those
which our long-boats use, £nd which I very
well knew how to manage, especially since
it was like that which I had in my patron's
fishing-boat, when, with my boy Xury, I
made my escape from the barbarian shore.
It was near two months, I think, before
I completed this work, and when all was
done, I had my man to teach its navigation
for though he very well understood how to
paddle a canoe along, he was an utter stran-
ger to a sail and a rudder, and was amazed
when he saw me work the boat by them,
and how the sail gibbed and filled this way
or that way, as the course we sailed changed.
After some time and a little use, I made
all these things very familiar to him, so that
he became an expert sailor, except in rela-
tion to the compass, and that I could make
him understand but little of. But as it hap-
pened, there was seldom occasion for it,
there being bat little cloudy weather, and
scarce any fog in those parts; the stars
were always visible in the night, and the
shore perspicuous by day, except in the
rainy season, which confined every one to
Q 2
his habitation. And this season beginning
to come on, obliged me to keep the longer
within doors; but before this, I brought my
new vessel into the creek, where I had landed
my rafts from the ship, and hauling her up
to the shore, I ordered my man Friday to
dig a dock sufficient to hold her in, and
deep enough to give her water, wherein she
might float; and then, when the tide was
out, we made a strong dam across the end
of it, to keep out the water; by which
means she lay dry, as to the tide from the sea;
and to keep the rain from her, we thatched
her over, as if were, with boughs of trees,
like a house, so we waited for the months
of November and December, in which I
designed to venture over the ocean.
As soon as the seasonable weather began
to draw near, I prepared for the voyage-
The first thing 1 thought on was to lay by
a certain quantity of provisions, as a suffi-
cient store for such an expedition, intending
in a week or fortnight's time to cpen the
dock, and to launch out the boat for that
purpose. But one morning', as I was very
busy upon some thing necessary for this
occasion, I called Friday to me, and bid him
go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find
a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we com-
monly had once a week, as much upon
account of the eggs, as for the sake of the
flesh. He had not been long gone, before
he came running back, as though he was
pursued for life, and, as it were, flew over
my outer wall, or fence, like one that felt
not the ground, and before 1 had time to
enquire the reason of his precipitation, he
cries out, " O clear, master! O sorrow; O
sorrow! Bad! O bad!" " Why what's the
motter, Friday?" said I. " O yonder, yonder !"
said he, "there be one, two or three canoes!
two, three!" Surely thought I there must
be six, by my man's way of reckoning; but
on a stricter enquiry, I found there were
Q 3
but three. "Well, Friday/' said I, "don't
be terrified, I warrant you we will not only
defend ourselves against them, but kill most
of these cruel savages/' But though I com-
forted him in the best manner I could, the
poor creature trembled so, I scarce knew
what to do with him: "O master," said
he, "they come look Friday; cut pieces
Friday, cut a me up." " Why, Friday," said
I, "they will eat me up as well as you, and
my danger is as great as yours. But since
it is so we must resolve to fight for our
lives. What say you ? Can you fight, Fri-
day ?" "Yes," said he, very faintly, "me
shoot, me kill what I can; but there come
a great many number." "That's no matter,"
said I again, " our guns will terrify those we
do not kill i I am very willing to stand by
you till the last drop of my blood. Now
tell me if you will do the like by me, and
obey my orders in whatsoever I command ?"
Friday then answered, " O master, me lose
life for you; me die when you bid die."
Thus concluding all questions concerning his
fidelity, immediately I fetched him a good
dram of ram. After he had drank it, 1
ordered him to take the two fowling-pieces,
which we always carried, and loaded them
with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol
bullets ; then I took four muskets, and load-
ed them with two slugs and five small
bullets each, charging my two pistols each
with a brace : I hung my great sword, as
customary, naked to my side, and gave
Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent wea-
pon for defence.
Thus prepared, I took my perspective-
glass, and went up to the side of a hill,
to see what I could discover; and I per-
ceived very soon by my glass, that there
were one-and-twenty savages, three prison-
ers, and three canoes, and that their chief
concern seemed to be the triumphant banquet
upon the three poor human bodies, a thing
which by this time I had observed was very
common with them. I also remarked that
they did not land at that place from whence
Friday made his escape, but nearer to the
creek, where the shore was low, and where
a thick wood came very close to the sea.
My soul was then filled with indignation
and abhorence at such inhuman wretches,
which put a period to all my former thoughts
in their vindication, neither would I give
myself time to consider their right of con-
quest, as I had done before; but descending
from the mountain, I came down to Friday,
and told him I was resolved to go speedily
to them, and kill them all; asking him again
in the same breath, if he would stand by
me; when by this time being recovered
from his fright and his spirits much cheered
with the dram I had given him, he seriously
told me, as he did before, " When I bid
die, he would die."
And I now divided the loaded arms be-
twixt us. To my man Friday I gave a
pistol to stick in his girdle, with three
guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great,
I confess, to bear; but what must a poor
king do, who had but one soldier in the
world ? But to show I made him bear no
more than what I would lay on myself, I
stuck the other pistol in my girdle, and
the other three guns upon my shoulders;
nay, something more, a small bottle of
rum, which was soon lightened to our
exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched
out, under a ponderous load of armour,
like two invincible champions, with a quan-
tity of powder and bullets to stand our
battle, and load again when the pieces were
discharged. I charged Friday to keep close
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or
attempt any thing till I commanded him;
and in the interim, not to speak so much
as one word.
I soon entered the thick wood, (my man
Friday following close behind,) when with
all possible wariness and silence I marched
till I came to the skirt of it, on that side
which was nearest to them; for only one
end of the wood interposed between me and
them. I called very softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree, was just at
the corner of the wood, I ordered him to
repair thither, and bring me word if he
could perceive their actions; he did as I
commanded him, and came back with this
melancholy story, that they were all about
their fire, eating the flesh of one of their
prisoners ; and that another lay bound upon
the sand, at a little distance from them,
which they designed for the next sacrifice ;
and this he told me was not one of their
nation, but one of those very bearded men
who were driven by a storm into their coun-
try, and whom he had so often talked to me
about. You may be sure that upon hear-
ing this, my soul was ready to sink within
me; when ascending a tree, I saw plainly
by my glass, a white man who lay upon
the beach, with his hands and feet tied
with things resembling rushes, being cover-
ed with clothes, and seemed to be an Eu-
ropean. From the tree where I took this
prospect, I perceived another tree and a
thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer
to them than where I was, which, by
taking a small circle round, I might come
at undiscovered, and then I should be with-
in half a shot of these devourers. And
going back about twenty paces, I got be-
hind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree; and then I
ascended a little rising ground, not above
eighteen yards distance, where I had a full
view of these creatures, and could perceive
ail their actions.
No less than nineteen sat upon the ground,
close huddled together, expressing all the
delight imaginable at so barbarous an enter-
tainment; and they had just sent the other
two to murder this poor unhappy Christian,
and bring him limb by limb to their fire;
for they were then going to untie the bands
from his feet in order for death, as fetters
are knocked off the feet of the malefactors
before they go to the place of execution.
Hereupon, immediately turning to my man
Friday, "Now, Friday," said I, " mind what
1 say, fail in nothing, but do exactly as you
see me do." All which he promising, I set
down one of my muskets and fowling-piece
upon the ground, and Friday did the same
by his; and with the other musket I took
my aim at the savages, bidding him do the
like. " Are you ready ?" said I. " Yes,
master," said. " Why, then, fire at them,"
said I; and that very moment I gave fire
likewise.
I only killed one and wounded two; but
my man Friday, taking his aim much better
than I, killed two and wounded three. You
may be sure they were in a dreadful con-
sternation at such an unexpected disaster,
and those who had yet escaped our shot,
immediately jumped upon their feet, but were
in such confusion that the)^ knew not which
way to run, not knowing from whence their
destruction came. We threw down our
pieces, and took up others, giving a second
dreadful volley; but as they were loaded
only with swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets*
we perceived only two of them fall; though
many were wounded, who ran yelling and
screaming about like mad creatures. " Now,
Friday," said I, " lay down your piece, and
take up the musket, and follow me." He
did so, with great courage; when, show-
ing ourselves to ths savages, we gave a
great shout, and made directly to the poor
victim, who would have been sacrificed had
not our first fire obliged the butchers, with
three others, to jump into the canoe. By
my order Friday fired at them, at which
shot I thought he had killed them all, by
their falling to the bottom of the boat;
however, he killed two, and mortally wound-
ed a third. In the mean time I cut the
flags that tied the hands and feet of the
poor creature, and lifting him up, asked
him in the Portuguese tongue, what he was ?
He answered me in Latin, Christianus; but
so very weak and faint, that he could
scarcely stand or speak. Immediately I gave
him a dram and a piece of bread, and asked
him what countryman he was ? He said,
Hispaniola, and then uttered all the thank-
fulness imaginable for his deliverance.
Seignor, said I, with as much Spanish as
I was master of, let us talk afterwards,
but fight now; here take this sword and
pistol, and do what you can. And, indeed,
he did so with such courage and intrepi-
dity, that he cut two of them into pieces
in an instant, the savages not having the
power to fly for their lives. I then ordered
Friday to run for those pieces we had left at
the tree, which he brought me with great
swiftness, and then I gave him my musket,
while I loaded the rest. There happened
a fierce encounter between the Spaniard
and one of the savages; and though the
former was as brave as could be expected,
having twice wounded his enemy in the
head, yet being weak and faint, the Indian
had thrown him upon the "ground, and was
wrestling my sword out of his hands, which
the Spaniard very wisely quitting, drew out
his pistol and shot him through the body
before I could come near him, though I
was running to his assistance. As for Fri-
day, he pursued the flying wretches with
his hatchet, dispatching tliree, but the rest
were too nimble for him. The Spaniard,
taking one of the fowling-pieces, wounded
two, who, running into the wood, Friday
pursued and killed; but the other, notwith-
standing his wounds, plunged himself into
R 2
the sea, and swam to those who were left
in the canoe, which, with one wounded,
were all that escaped out of one-and-twenty.
The savages in the canoe wrorked very
hard to get out of our reach, and Friday
was eager in pursuing them; and, indeed,
I was no less anxious about their escape,
lest after the news had been carried to
their people, they should return in multi-
tudes, and destroy us. So being resolved
to pursue them, I jumped into one of
their canoes, and bid Friday follow me;
but no sooner was I in, than, to my sur-
prise, I found another poor creature bound
hand and foot for the slaughter, just as
the Spaniard had been, with very little
life in him. I unbound him and would
have helped him up, but he could neither
stand nor speak, but groaned piteously,
thinking he was only unbound in order to
be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; when
pulling out my bottle, I made the poor
wretch drink a dram, which with the joy-
ful news he had received, so revived him,
that he sat up. As soon as Friday heard
him speak, and looked more fully in his
face, it would have moved any one to tears
to perceive his uncommon transport: he
kissed, embraced him, hugged him, cried
laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced
sung, wrung his hands, and beat his face
and head, like a distracted creature, so that
it was a great while before I could make
him speak or tell me what was the matter;
but at last he told me it was his father.
I was infinitely moved to see the dutiful
and tender affection this poor savage had
to his aged parent. He would sit down by
him in the boat, open his breast, and bold
his father's head close to his bosom, half
cJi hour together, to cherish him; his arms
and ancles, which were stiff and numbed
with binding, he chafed and rubbed with
r 3
his hands. Perceiving what the case was,
I gave him some rum, which proved of
great benefit to him.
While we were thus employed, the sa-
vages were almost out of sight; and happy
it was we did not pursue them; for there
arose from the north-west such a violent
storm, that I could not suppose otherwise
but that they were all drowned. After this
I called Friday to me, and asked him if
he had given his father any bread ? He
shook his head and said, " None, not one
bit, me eat a up all; so I gave him a
cake of bread, and likewise a dram for
himself, and two or three bunches of raisins
for his father. Both these be carried to him,
for he would make him drink the dram to
comfort him.
Then he ran for an earthen jug of water
for his father, which revived his spirits more
than all the rum I had given him.
I then called Fridav to me, and ordered
him to carry the Spaniard a cake, and some
water, who was reposing himself under the
shade of a tree, but so weak, that though
he exerted himself, he could not stand. Upon
which I ordered Friday to rub and bathe
his ancles with rum, as he had done his
father's. Every minute he was employed in
this, he would cast a wistful eye towards the
boat, where he left his father sitting, who
suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightning
to him, and finding he had only laid him-
self down to ease his limbs, he returned to
me presently; and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead
him to the boat, in order to be conveyed
to my dwelling, where 1 would take care
of him. Upon which Friday took him upon
his back, and carried him to the canoe,
setting him close by his father; and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat off
and paddled it along the shore faster than
I could walk, though the wind blew very
hard, and having brought them safe to the
creek, he took them out of the boat; but
so weak were they that I was forced to
make a kind of hand-barrow to convey them
to my castle.
To get provisions for my poor weak sub-
jects, I ordered Friday to kill me a yearling
goat; which, when he had done, I cut off
the hinder quarters, and chopping it into
small pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting
barley and rice into the broth. This 1 car-
ried into their tent, set a table, dined with
them myself, and encouraged them. Friday
was my interpreter to his father, and indeed
to the Spaniard too, who spoke the lan-
guage of the savages pretty well. After
dinner I ordered Friday to fetch home all
our arms from the field of battle, and the
next day to bury the dead bodies, which
he accordingly did.
I made Friday enquire of his father, whe-
ther he thought these savages had escaped
the late storm in their canoe ? and if so,
whether they would not return with a pow-
er too great for us to resist ? He answered,
that he thought it impossible they could out-
live the storm; or, if they were driven south-
wardly, they would come to a land where
they would be certainly devoured.
No canoes appearing soon after, as I ex-
pected, my apprehensions ceased; and my
former thoughts of a voyage returned, es-
pecially when Friday's father assured me, T
should have good usage in his nation. As
to the Spaniard, he told me, that sixteen
more of his countrymen and Portuguese,
who had been shipwrecked, made their es-
cape thither; that though they were in union
with the savages, yet they were very mi-
serable for want of provisions and other
necessaries. When I asked him about the
particulars of his voyage, he answered that
their ship was bound from Rio de la Plata
to the Havannah, that when the ship was
lost, only five men perished in the ocean;
the rest, having saved themselves in the
boat, were now landed on the main conti-
nent. "And what do they intend to do there ?**
said I. He replied, "they had concerted mea-
sures to escape, by building a vessel, but
they had neither tools nor provisions, so
hat all their designs came to nothing." " Sup-
posing," said I, " 1 should make a proposal,
and invite them here, would they not carry
me prisoner to New Spain ?" He answered,
"No; for he knew them to be honest men,
who would scorn to act so basely to their
deliverer : that, if I pleased, be and the old
savage would go over and talk with them
about it, and bring me an answ7er: that they
sbould all swear fidelity to me as their
leader; and he would not only do the same,
but stand to the last drop of his blood,
should there be occasion."
These solemn assurances made me resolve
to grant tbem relief, and to send these two
over for that purpose; but when every thing
was ready, the Spaniard raised an objection,
which carried great weight with it: " You
know, Sir," said he, "that having been
sometime with you, I cannot but be sensible
of your stock of rice and corn; sufficient,
perhaps, for us at present, but not for thein,
should they come over presently, much less
to victual a vessel for an intended voyage.
Want might be as great an occasion for
them to disagree and rebel, as the children
of Israel did against God himself, when they
wanted bread in the wilderness. And, there-
fore, my advice is, to wait another harvest,
and in the meantime cultivate and improve
more land, whereby we may have plenty
of provisions, in order to execute our design."
This advice of the Spaniards I approved
extremelv, and so satisfied was I of his
fidelity, that I esteemed him ever after. We
all four went to work upon some more
land; and against seed-time we had so much
cured and trimmed up as was sufficient to
sow twenty-two bushels of barley and sixteen
jars of rice. As we were four in number,
and by this time all in good health, we
feared not a hundred Indians, should they
venture to attack us; and while the corn
was growing, I pitched upon some trees, fit
to build us a large vessel, in case the Spa-
niards came over; which being marked, I or-
dered Friday and his father to cut them
down, appointing the Spaniard, who was
now my privy-counsellor, to oversee and di-
rect the whole. I likewise increased my
flocks of goats, by shooting the wild dams,
and bringing home their kids to my enclo-
sure. Nor did I neglect the grape-season,
but cured them as usual, though I had such
a quantity now as would have filled eighty
barrels with raisins. And thus all of us
being employed, they in working, and I in
providing for them, till harvest came, God
Almighty blessed the increase of it so much
that out of twenty-two barrels of barley, we
thrashed out two hundred and twenty, and
the like quantity of rice, sufficient to victual
a ship fit to carry me and all the Spaniards
to any part of America.
Thus the principal objection being an-
swered, I sent my two ambassadors ovei
to the main land, with a regal authority
to administer the oaths of allegiance and
fidelity, and have an instrument signed un-
der their hands, though I never asked whether
they had pen, ink, or paper; when giving
each of them a musket, eight charges of
pow7der and ball, and provisions enough for
eight days, they sailed away with a fair
gale.
Scarce a fortnight had t-lapsed, when im
patient for their return, I laid down to
sleep one morning, when a strange acci-
dent ha^ pened, which was ushered in by
Friday's running to me, and calling aloud,
"Master, master, they are come they are
s
come." Upon which, not dreaming of any
danger, out I jumped from my bed, put on
my clothes, and hurried through my little
grove; when looking towards the sea, I
perceived a boat about a league and a
half distant, standing in for the shore with
the wind fair. I beheld they did not come
from the side were the land lay, but from
the southermost end of the island: so
these being none of the people we wanted,
I ordered Friday to lie still, till I came
down from the mountain, which I now as-
cended, in order to discover more fully
what they were; and with the help of my
perspective glass, I plainly perceived an
English ship, which filled me with such un-
common transport of joy as I cannot de-
scribe ; and yet some secret doubts hung
about me proceeding from I know not what
cause, as though I had reason to be upon
my guard.
It was not long before I perceived the
boat approach the shore, as if they were
looking for a place where they might con-
veniently land; and at last they ran their
boat on shore upon the beach, about half a
mile distance. Now I was fully convinced
they were all Englishmen, three of which
were unarmed and bound; when immedi-
ately the first four or five leaped on shore,
and took those three out of the boat as pri-
soners ; one of whom, I could perceive, used
the most passionate gestures of entreaty,
affliction, and despair, while the others
showed great concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was
very much astonished, and I beckoned to
Friday, who was below, to ascend the moun-
tain. " O master/' said he to me, " you
see English mans eat prisoners as well as
savage mans." " And do you think they
will eat them, Friday ?" said I. ' " Yes,"
said Friday, "they eat a all up." "No,
no," said I, " Friday, I am much more
s 2
concerned lest they murder them; but as
for eating them up, thatl am sure they
will never do."
And now I not only lamented my mis-
fortune in not having the Spaniard and the
savage with me, but also that I could not
come within shot of them unperceived, and
save these three men, whom I thought they
were going to kill. But some comfort it
was to me, that I perceived they were set
at liberty to go where they pleased, the ras-
cally seamen scattering about as though they
had a mind to see the place; and so long
did they negligently ramble, that the tide
had ebbed so low as to leave the boat
aground. Nor were the two men who were
in her more circumspect; for having drunk
a little to much liquor, they fell fast asleep ;
but one of them waking before the other,
and perceiving the boat too fast aground
for his strength to move, he hallooed out
to the rest, who made all possible expedi-
tion to come to him; but as Providence
ordered it, all their force was ineffectual to
launch her, when I could hear them speak
to one another, " Why, let her alone, Jack,
can't ye, she'll float next tide;" by which
I was convinced they were my own coun-
trymen, 1 took two fusees on my shoulder,
and gave Friday three muskets; besides,
my formidable goat-skin coat and monstrous
cap made me look so fierce and terrible as
Hercules of old, especially when two pis-
tols were stuck in my belt, and my naked
sword hanging by my side.
It was my design at first not to make
any attempt till it was dark; and it being
now two o'clock, in the very heat of the
day, the sailors were all straggling in the
woods, and undoubtedly were lain down to
sleep. The three poor distressed creatures,
too anxious to get any repose, were seate.l
under the shade of a great tree, about a
quarter of a mile from me, Upon which,
s 3
without any more ado, I approached them,
with my man following behind me, and,
before I was perceived, I called aloud to
them in Spanish, "What are ye, gentle-
men ?"
At these words they started up in great
confusion, when they beheld the strange fi-
gure I made; they returned no answer, but
seemed as if they would fly from me.
" Gentlemen," said I, in English, " don't be
afraid; perhaps you have a friend nearer
than you expect." " He must be from hea-
ven/' said one of them, gravely pulling off
his hat, '' for we are past all help in this
world." "All help is from heaven," said
I; " but, Sir, as I have perceived every ac-
tion between you and these brutes since your
landing, only inform me how to assist you
and I will do it to the utmost of my power."
"Am I talking with God or man," adds
he. " Are you of human kind or an angel ?"
"Sir," said I, "my poor habit will tell you
I am a man, and an Englishman, willing to
assist you, having hut this servant. Here
are arms and ammunition; tell freely your
condition: Can we save you?" "The story,'*
said he, " is too long to relate, since our
butchers are so near; but, Sir, I was mas-
ter of that ship, my men have mutinied,
and il is a favour they have put my mate,
this passenger, and me on shore, without
murdering us, though we expect nothing
but perishing here." "Are your enemies
gone?" said I. "No," replied he, pointing
to a thicket, " there they lie; while my
heart trembles, lest having seen and heard
us they should murder us all." " Have
they any fire-arms?" said I. "They have
but two pieces," said he, " one of which
is left in the boat." He also told me there
were two enormous villains among them,
that were the authois of this mutiny, who,
if they were killed or seized, the rest might
return to their obedience, " Well, well,"
said I, "let us retire farther under cover of
the woods;" and there it was I made these
conditions with him.
1. That, while they staid in the island,
they should not pretend to any authority;
but should entirely conform to my orders,
and return me the arms which I should
put in their hands.
2. That if the ship was recovered, they
should afford Friday and myself a passage
gratis to England.
When he had given me all the satisfac-
tion I could desire, I gave him and his two
companions each of them a gun, with pow-
der and ball sufficient, advising them to
fire upon them as they lay sleeping. The
captain modestly said, that he was sorry
to kill them; though on the other hand,
to let these villains escape., who were the
authors of his misery, might be the ruin
of us all. "Well," said he, "do as you
think fit;" and so accordingly I fired, kil-
led one of the captain's chief enemies, and
wounded the other, who eagerly called for
assistance; but the captain, who had re-
served his piece, coming up to him, (< Sirrah/'
said he, " 'tis too late to call for assistance,
you should rather cry to God to pardon
your villainy; and so knocked him down
with the stock of his gun; three others
were also slightly wounded, who at my
approach, cried out for help. This the cap-
tain granted, upon condition that they would
swear to be true to him in recovering the
ship, which they solemnly did; however, I
obliged the captain to keep them bound.
After which I sent Friday and the captain's
mate to secure the boat, and bring away the
oars and sails; when, at their return, three
men coming back, and seeing their late dis-
tressed captain now their conqueror, sub-
mitted to be bound also. And then it was,
that having more liberty, I related the
adventures of my own life, which he heard
with serious attention. After this, I carried
him and his two companions into my little
fortified castle; showed them all my con-
veniences and refreshed them with such
provisions as I could afford. When this
was over, wTe began to consider about
regaining the ship. He said that there were
twenty-six hands on board, who, knowing
their lives were forfeited for conspiracy and
mutiny, were so very hardened, that it would
be dangerous for our small company to attack
them. This was a reasonable inference in-
deed ; but something we must resolve on,
and immediately put it into execution. We,
therefore, heaved the boat upon the beach,
so high that she could not shoot off at
high-water mark, and broke a hole in her
not easily to be stopped; so that all the
signals they gave for the boat to come on
board were in vain. This obliged them to
send another boat ashore, with ten men
armed, whose faces the captain plainly des-
cribed, the boatswain being the chief officer;
but he said there were three honest lads
among them, who were forced into the con-
spiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage.
When the sailors landed, and beheld their
boat in that condition, they not only hal-
looed, but fired for their companions to
hear, yet they received no answer. This
struck them with horror and amazement;
and thinking they were murdered, they made
as if they would return to the ship. I could
perceive the captain's countenance change
at this; till of a sudden three men were
ordered to look after the boat, while the
other seven leaped on shore in order to
search for their companions; and, indeed,
they came to the brow of the hill, near my
ancient castle from whence they could see
to a great distance into the woods, and there
shouting and hallooing till tired and weary,
they at length seated themselves under
spreading tree. My opinion was, that no-
thing could be done till night, when I might
use some artifice to get them all out of the
boat; but of a sudden they started up, and
made to the sea-side : I then ordered Friday
and the captain's mate to go over the creek,
and halloo as loud as they could, and so,
decoying them into the woods, come round
to me again. And this, indeed, had good
effect; for they followed the noise, till com-
ing westward to the creek, they called for
their boat to carry them over, and taking
one of the men out of her, left two to look
after her, having fastened her to the stump
of a little tree on shore. Hereupon imme-
diately the captain and our party passing
the creek out of their sight, we surprised
them both, by the captain's knocking down
one, and ordering the other to surrender
upon pain of death; and who, being the
honestest of them all, sincerely joined with
us.
By this time it was pretty late; when the
rest returning to their boat, which they
found aground in the creek, the tide out,
and the men gone, they ran about wringing
their hands, crying it was an enchanted
island, and that they should be all mur-
dered by spirits or devils. My men would
willingly have fallen upon them, but I would
not agree to hazard any of our party: but,
to be more certain, Friday and the captain
crawled upon their hands and feet, as near
as possible; and when the boatswain ap-
proached in sight, so eager was the captain,
that he fired and killed him on the spot;
Friday wounded the next man, and a third
ran awav. Hereupon I advanced with my
whole army; and it being dark, I ordered
the man we had surprised in the boat to
call them by their names, and to parley wTith
them, which he did, and they were at length
induced to lay down their arms in token of
submission.
After this the captain expostulated with
T
them, telling them that the governor was
an Englishman, who might execute them
here but he thought they would all be
sent to England, except Will Atkins, who
was ordered to prepare for death the next
morning. Hereupon Atkins implored the
captain to intercede for his life, and the
rest begged they might not be sent to En-
gland. This answered our project for seizing
the ship. For after sending Atkins and two
of the worst fast bound to the cave, and
the rest being committed to my bower, I
sent the captain to treat with them in the
governor's name, offering them pardon if they
would assist in recovering the ship. Upon
which they all promised to stand by him to
the last drop of their blood; and whoever
acted treacherously should be hanged in
chains upon the beach. They were all re-
leased on these assurances ; and the captain
repaired to the other boat, making his pas-
senger captain of her, and gave him four
men well armed; while himself, his mate,
and five more went in the other boat. By
midnight they came within call of the ship,
when the captain ordered Robinson to hail
her, and tell them, that with great difficulty
they had found the men at last. But while
they were discoursing, the captain, his mate,
and the rest, entered and knocked down the
second mate and carpenter, secured those
that were upon the deck, by putting them
under hatches, while the other boat's crew
entered and secured the forecastle ; they then
broke into the round-house, where the mate
after some resistance, shot the pirate captain
through the head; upon which all the rest
yielded themselves prisoners. And thus the
ship being recovered, the signal was fired*
which I heard with the greatest joy ima-
ginable ; nor was it long before he brought
the ship to an anchor at the creek's mouth,
where, coming to me unawares, "There,"
says he, "my dearest friend and deliverer,
t 2
there is your ship, and we are your ser-
vants :" a comfort so unspeakable as made
me swoon in his arms, while, with gratitude
to heaven, we were tenderly embracing each
other.
Nothing now remained, but to consult
what we should do with the prisoners, whom
he thought it was not safe to take on board.
Concerting with the captain, I dressed my-
self in one of his suits, and sending for
them, told them that I was going to leave
the island with all my people; if they would
stay there, their lives should be spared; if
not, they should be hanged at the first port
they came to. They agreed to stay. Here-
upon I told them my whole story, charging
them to be kind to the Spaniards, that were
expected, giving them all my arms, and
informing them of everything necessary for
their subsistance; after which, I and my
man Friday went on board. But the next
morning, two of the men came swimming to
the ship's side, desiring the captain to take
them on board, though he hanged them
afterwards, complaining how barbarously the
others used them. Upon which I prevailed
with the captain to take them in, and being
severely whipped, they proved more honest
for the future. Thus I bade farewell to
this island, carrying along with me my
money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat's-skin
cap; setting sail December the 12th, 1686,
after twenty-eight years, two months, and
nineteen day's residence, that same day and
month that I escaped from Salee, landing
in England, June 11, 1687, after five-and-
thirty years' absence from my own country,
which rendered me altogether a stranger
there.
I found my first captain's widow alive,
but in very mean circumstances. Soon
after, I went down to Yorkshire, where all
my family was expired, except two sisters,
and two of my brother's children. I found
t 3
no provision had been made for me, they
concluding I had been long since dead.
Thus my circumstances would have been
very indifferent had not my partner con-
ducted the affairs of my plantation in the
most honourable and profitable manner du-
ring my absence, so that I found myself
possessed of five thousand pounds, besides an
income of one thousand pounds a year, I
discovered my excellent friend, the Portuguese
captain; and as he was in necessitous
circumstances, I evinced my gratitude for
his past kindness, by a handsome yearly
allowance of money.
Not liking to reside at the Brazils, I de-
termined to sell my plantation and settle
in England; and marrying a young lady of
very good family, I seemed to bid adieu
to my roving inclinations. I had two sons
and one daughter; and purchasing a farm
in the county of Bedford, I led the life
of a country gentleman, and was as happy
in rcy retirement as the greatest monarch
in the world—
Free from all vices, free from care,
Age had no pain, and youth no snare.
Bat in the midst of this my happiness, I
was suddenly plunged into the greatest sor-
row, hv the death of my dear and tender
vwfe. It is impossible to express the beau-
ties of her mind, or the loveliness of her
person; she had the greatest influence over
my conduct and character; she was the
spirit of all my affairs, and the centre of
my enterprises:—when she was gone, I seem-
ed like a ship without a pilot; my country
delights became as insipid and dull as music
and science to those who have neither taste
nor ingenuity. In short, I left my farm,
and in a few months returned to London.
"Rut that great city, so famous for its va-
riety of entertainment, could afford me no
delight. It was now the beginning of the
year 1694, at which time my nephew, who
was returned from a short voyage to Bilboa,
came to me one morninsr, telling- me, that
some merchants of his acquaintance had
proposed to him to go a voyage for them
to the East Indies and China, in the man-
ner of private traders; "and now, uncle,"
said he, "if you'll accompany me thither,
I'll engage to land you upon your own is-
land, to see the state of your little kingdom."
Just before he came in, my thoughts
were fixed to get a patent for its possesssion,
and then to fill it with inhabitants. After
I had paused awhile, and looked stedfastly
on him, " What spirit," said I, " sent you
with this unlucky errand?" He started at
first; bat recovering himself, when he per-
ceived I was not offended, "Sir," replied he,
" what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be
styled unlucky, since certainly you must be
desirous to see your little territory, where
you reigned with more content than any of
your brother kings In the universe." I was
not long in forming my resolution, which
overswayed my good friend, the widow's
persuasions and the natural affection I bore
my young children. I made my will, and
settled my estate in such a manner, that I
was perfectly sure my poor infants would
have justice done them. The good widow
not only undertook to make provision for
my voyage, but also took charge of my do-
mestic affairs, and to provide for my chil-
dren's education; and indeed no mother
could take more care, or understand the
office better; for which I live to reward
and return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January, 1694—5, my
nephew being ready to sail, I and Friday
went on board in the Downs, on the 8th,
having, besides a framed sloop ready to be
set up in the island, a very considerable
cargo for my new colony. I had servants,
whom I proposed to leave there, if thev
should appear willing; two carpenters, a
smith, and a very ingenious fellow who was
Jack-of-all-trades; for he was not only a
cooper by trade, but was also dexterous at
making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn,
likewise a good turner, and a good pot
maker. I also carried a tailor, who con-
sented to stay in my plantation, and proved a
most useful fellow in the island. My cargo
consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen,
and English stuffs for clothing the Spa-
niards that I expected to find there; as
likewise gloves, hats, shoes, stockings; to-
gether with beds, bedding, and household
stuff, especially kitchen-utensils, with pots,
kettles, pewter, brass, &c.; also nails, tools
of all sorts, staples, hooks, hinges, and all
other things necessary ; which, I think, cost
me about three hundred pounds. Nor was
this all; for I carried a hundred spare arms,
muskets and fusees, besides some pistols,
considerable quantity of several sorts of
shot, two brass cannons, besides swords,
cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes
and halberts.
Well, we put out to sea: and though
I can't say this voyage was so unprosper-
ous as my others had been, yet contrary
winds drove us so far northward, that wre
were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ire-
land, where we lay wind-bound two-and-
twenty days. Here, indeed, provisions were
very cheap, and we added to our ship's stores
by taking several live hogs, two cows and
calves, which I resolved to put on shore
in my island, if our necessities did not
call for them. On the 5th of February
we sailed from Ireland, with a very fair
gale, which lasted for some days; and I
think it was about the 20th of the same
month, late in the evening, when the mate
informed us that he saw a flash of fire,
and heard a gun fired; and when he was
speaking, a boy came in, and told us that
the boatswain had heard another. Upon
which we all ran to the quarter-deck, from
whence, in a few moments, we perceived
a terrible fire at a distance. We had im-
mediately recourse to our reckonings, in
which we were all of opinion, that there
could be no land that way, it appearing to
be at N. N. W. We concluded that some
ship had taken fire at sea, and that it
could not be far off, by the report of the
guns which we had heard. We made up
directly to it, and in half an hour's time,
the wind being fair, we could plainly per-
ceive a great ship on fire in the middle of
the sea.
Touched with this unhappy disaster, and
considering my former circumstances, when
the Portuguese captain took me up, I imme-
diately ordered five guns to be fired, that
the poor creatures, not seeing us, it being
dark, (though we could perceive their flame,)
might be sensible there was deliverance at
hand, and consequently might endeavour to
save themselves in their boats. Nor was it
lon<r before the ship blew up in the air,
and the fire was extinguished in the ocean.
But supposing them to be all in their
boats, we hung out our lanterns, and kept
firing till eight o'clock in the morning;
when with our perspectives, we beheld two
boats full of people, making towards us»
though the tide wTas against them; then
spreading out our ancient, and hanging out
a waft, as a signal for them to come on
board, in half an hour's time we came up
with them, and took them all in, there
being no less than sixty-four, men, women
and children. It was a French merchant-
ship of three hundred tons, homeward-bound
from Quebec, in the river Canada. The
master informed me how, by the negligence
}f the steersman, the steerage was set on
ire: that, at his outcry for help, the fire
vas, as he thought, totallv extinguished;
u
but that some sparks getting between the
timber and within the ceiling, it proceeded
into the hold, where there was no resisting
it; and when they got into their boats, as
creatures in their last extremity, with what
provisions they had, together with oars,
sails, and a compass, intending to go back
to Newfoundland, the wind blowing at S.
E. by E. though there were several chances
against them; but, said he, in this our
great distress, we heard the welcome report
of your guns, when with unspeakable joy,
taking down our masts and sails, we were
resolved to lie by till morning; but per-
ceiving your light, we set our oars at work
to keep our boat a-head, the sooner to
attain your ship, the happy instrument of
our deliverance.
Indeed, no one can express the joy of
these poor creatures on this awful occasion.
The behaviour of a young priest was very
remarkable. At his entrance on board the
ship, he fell on his face in the most humble
prostration to the Almighty. I thought he
had fallen into a swoon, and ran to help
him up; but he modestly told me, he was
returning thanks to the Almighty, desiring
me to leave him a few moments, and that,
next to his Creator, he would return me
thanks also. And indeed he did so, about
three minutes after, with great seriousness
and affection, while the tears stood in his
eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude
of his soul. The next day the captain
and priest desired to speak with me and
my nephew the commander. They told us
they had saved some money and valuable
things out of the ruined vessel, which was
at our service; only that they desired to
be set on shore somewhere in our way.
At first my nephew was for accepting the
money; but I (who knew how hard my case
would have been had the Portuguese captain
served me so) persuaded him to the contrary;
u 2
and therefore told them that we had done
nothing but what we were obliged to do, by
nature and humanity, and what we ourselves
might expect from others in such calamity;
we took them up to save, not plunder them,
and therefore would not accept their money.
But as to landing them, that was a great
difficulty ; for being bound to the East Indies,
it was impossible to change our voyage
upon their account, nor could my nephew
answer it to the freighters. All that we could
do was to put ourselves in the way of some
ships homeward-bound from the West
Indies, that, if possible, they might get a
passage to France or England. Indeed,
they were very thankful for our first kind-
ness ; but were under great concern, especi-
ally the passengers, at being carried to the
East ladies: they begged therefore, I would
keep on the banks of Newfoundland, where
probably they might meet with some ship
or sloop to carry them to Canada, whence
they came. As this was but a reasonable
request, I was inclined to grant it; and as
it happened, in a week's time, we made the
banks of Newfoundland, where the French
people hired a bark to carry them to France.
But the priest being desirous to go to the
East Indies, I readily agreed to it, because
I liked his conversation, and two or three
of the French sailors also entered themselves
on board our ship.
Now, directing our course for the West
Indies, another adventure happened to exer-
cise oar humanity. In the latitude of twenty-
seven degrees, five minutes north, the 19th
of March, 1694—5, we perceived a sail
which bore upon us, and then she appeared
to be a large vessel, having lost her main-
topmast and bowsprit; when firing a gun
as a signal of distress, we soon came to
speak with her. She was a ship from
Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, out
of which road she had been forced in a
u 3
hurricane to the westward, in which they
lost their masts.
In this ship were passengers, a youth,
his mother, and a maid servant, who were
in a most deplorable condition for want o*
food. If I had not gone on board their
ship, the knowledge of their misery had
been concealed from me, and they would
have inevitably perished, though, indeed,
their second mate, who was captain, (the
true captain not being on board when the
hurricane happened) had before informed
me that there were such persons on board,
whom he supposed to be dead, being afraid
to enquire after them, because he had no-
thing to give them for relief. Hereupon
we resolved to let them have what we could
spare, ordering the mate to bring some of
his men on board, which he did accordingly.
He and they looked like skeletons. When
meat was set before them, I ordered them
to eat sparingly. When they were fed, we
ordered our mate to carry them a sack of
bread, and four or five pieces of beef; but
the surgeon charged them to see it boiled,
and keep a guard on the cook-room, to
prevent the men from eating it raw, and
consequently killing themselves with what
was designed for their relief. But, par-
ticularly, I desired the mate to see what
condition the poor passengers were in;
and the surgeon gave him a pitcher of the
same broth which he had prepared for tl e
men. And being curious to see this scene
of misery myself, I took the captain (as we
called the mate of the ship) in our own
boat, and sailed after them.
Here was a sad sight indeed! Scarce
were the victuals half-boiled in the pot,
but they were ready to break open the cook-
room door. To stay their stomachs, the
mate gave them biscuits, which wtre dipped
and softened with the liquor of the meat,
which they call bruise; telling them it was
for their own safety, that he was obliged
to give them hut a little at a time; and
so feeding them gradually, the men did
very well again. But when they came to
the poor gentlewoman in the cabin, who
for several days had continued without
food, giving what she had to her son, they
found her in the arms of death. She was
sitting upon the floor of the deck, with
her back against the sides, between two
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head
shrunk between her shoulders, like a sense-
less corpse. Nothing was wanting in my
mate to revive and encourage her; opening
her lips, and putting some broth into her
mouth with a spoon. But not having
strength to speak, she lifted up her head
with much difficulty, intimating that it was
now too late; at the same time pointing
to the youth, her son, as though she de-
sired him to do what he could, to save the
lad; and, in a little time after, she died*
The youth, indeed, was not so far gone,
vet, lay stretched out on the cabin bed, like
one that had scarce any life. In his mouth
was a piece of an old glove, the rest of which
he had ate up. At first he vomited what
the mate had given him; but at length
began sensibly to revive, though in the
greatest concern for the death of his tender
mother.
As to the poor maid, she lay by her
mistress, like one in the last pangs of
death : her limbs were distorted,, one of her
hands was clasped round the frame of a
chair, which she grasped so hard that it
was with some difficulty we separated her
from it; her other arm lay over her head,
and her feet lay both together, set fast
against the frame of the cabin table; not
only being starved with hunger, but over-
come with grief at the loss of her mistress,
whom she loved most tenderly. It was a
great while before the surgeon could bring
her to life, and a much longer time before
she came to her senses.
After we had sailed with them some days,
we sent them five barrels of beef, one of
pork, two hogsheads of biscuits, with peas,
flour, and other things; taking three casks
of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of
eight, as payment, we left them, but took
the youth and maid with us, with all their
goods. The lad was about seventeen years
old, very handsome, modest, sensible, and
well-bred, but much grieved for the loss of
his mother, having lost his father at Bar-
badoes but a few months before. He be-
sought the surgeon to intercede with me to
take him out of the ship; for that the sai-
lors, by not sparing a small sustenance,
had starved his mother. But hunger has
no bounds, and consequently is incapable of
any compassion. When the surgeon told
him our voyage might put him in bad cir-
cumstances, and farther from his friends, he
said he did not care, if he was delivered
from that terrible crew, and as the captain
(meaning me) had saved him from death,
so he was sure he would do him no harm ;
and, as for the maid, when she was restored
to her senses, she would be no less thankful,
let us carry them where we would. And
indeed the surgeon so represented their
case to me, that I consented, and took them
on board with all their goods. I had great
difficulty in finding my little kingdom, for
as I came to and went from it before, on
the south and east side of the island, as
coming from the Brazils, so now approaching
between the main and the island, not
having any chart of the coast, nor landmark,
it obliged me to go on shore on several
islands in the mouth of the river Oronoko,
but to no purpose. Thus I perceived, that
what I thought was a continent before was
no such thing, but a long island, or rather
a ridge of sands. At length I came far on
the south side of my island, and then I
presently knew the countenance of my little
kingdom.
No sooner did I see the place, but calling
for Friday, I asked him where he was;
when he looked a little, he clapped his
hands, crying, " O joy, O there, O yes,
O there!" pointing to our old abode, and
then began dancing and capering as if he
were mad, and I had much ado to keep him
from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore.
" Friday," said I, " what do you think
shall we see your father ?" At the mention-
ing his father's name, the poor affectionate
creature fell a weeping : " No, no," says he,
" me see him no more, never see poor
father more! he long ago die, die long ago,
he much old man." " You don't know that,"
said I, "but shall we see any body else?"
He looks about, and, pointing to the hill
above my house, cries out, " We see there
much men, and there;" which, though I
could not perceive them with ray perspective-
glass, was true, by what the men themselves
told me the next day.
When the English ancient was spread,
and three guns fired, as a signal of friend-
ship, we perceived a smoke rise from the
creek; upon which I ordered the boat out,
taking Friday with me, and hanging out a
white flag of truce, I went on shore, ac-
companied also by the young friar, to whom
I had related the history of the first part of
my life; besides, we had sixteen men well
armed, in case wTe had met with any op-
position.
After we had rowed directly into the
creek, the first man I fixed niv eyes upon
was the Spaniard, whose life I had saved,
and whose face I perfectly well knew. I
ordered them all to stay in the boat for a
while; but Friday, perceiving his father at
a distance, would have jumped into the
sea, had they not let the boat go. No
x
sooner was he on shore, but he flew like a
swift arrow out of a bow to embrace his
aged father. Certainly it would melt a
man of the firmest resolution into the soft-
est tears, to see with what uncommon trans-
ports of joy he saluted him; he first kissed
him, then stroked his face, took him in his
arms, laid him under a shady tree, sat
down by him, then looked as earnestly
at him, as one would do at a picture, for
a quarter of an hour together. After this
he would lie upon the ground, stroke his
legs and kiss them, then get up and stare
at him, as though he was bewitched: but
the next day one could not forbear laughing
to see his behaviour; for he would walk
several hours with his father along the shore,
leading him by the hand; while every now
and then he would run to the boat and
get something for him, as a lump of sugar,
dram, biscuit, or something or other that
was good. His frolics ran in another chan-
nel in the afternoon; when he set old Fri-
day on the ground, he would dance round
him, making comical postures and gestures;
and all the while telling him one story or
another of his travels and adventures.
It was on the 10th of April, 1695, that
I set my foot upon the island a second time.
When my faithful Spaniard, accompanied
by one more, approached the boat, he little
knew who I was, till I discovered myself
to him. " Seignor," said I, in Portuguese,
" don't you know me ?" He spoke not a
word; but giving his musket to his attend-
ant, extended his arms, and saying some-
thing in Spanish, that I did not understand,
he came forward and embraced me, saying,
he was inexcusable not to know his deli-
verer; who like an angel sent from heaven,
had saved his life. He then beckoned to
the men to call out his companions; asked
me if I would walk to my own habitation,
and take possession, where I should find
x 2
some mean improvements; but, indeed they
were extraordinary ones; for they had
planted trees so close together, that the
place was like a labyrinth, which none
could find out except themselves, who knew
its intricate windings.
I asked him the meaning of all these
fortifications. In answer to this question,
he gave me a minute account of all that
had taken place during my absence, from
which I found they had been so much
alarmed by the repeated visits of the
neighbouring savages, that they had found
it necessary to adopt every possible means
of self-defence; on which account they
had planted those trees, whose rapid growth
had formed the fortifications which had
created in me so much surprise. I found
they had had many fierce encounters with
the savages, some of whom they had
taken prisoners, and by kind treatment had
so far gained their love and confidence,
that they had become naturalized among
them, and their savage habits much sub-
dued ; the Englishmen that had remained
on the island after my departure, had also,
by their obstinacy and insubordination, given
them much trouble; but they had also re-
turned to their allegiance, and all at the
time of my arrival were in the enjoyment
of peace and comfort, some few were mar-
ried to the female savages they had rescued
from the hands of their devouring enemies,
so that the appearance of my little colony
was much changed in my nine vears' abseace.
After my faithful Spaniard had concluded
his account, I told him I was come to es-
tablish and not to remove them ; and upon
that occasion, had not only brought them
necessaries for convenience and defence, but
also artificers, and other persons, both for
the necessary employments, and to add to
their number. They were altogether when
1 thus talked to them; and before I de-
x 3
livered the stores I brought, I asked them
one by one, if they had entirely forgot
their first animosities, would engage in the
strictest friendship, and shake hands with
one another ? On this Will Atkins, who
had been the most troublesome among the
Englishmen, with abundance of good hu-
mour, said they had had affliction enough
to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends: as for himself, he
would live and die among them.
After these kind declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed all to dine together the
next day; upon this I caused the ship's
cook and his mate to come on shore, to
assist in dressing our dinner. We brought
from the ship six pieces of beef, and four
of pork, together with our punch-bowl, and
materials to fill it; and in particular I
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and
ten of English beer, which was very ac-
ceptable to them. The Spaniards added to
our feast five whole kids, which being
roasted, three of them was sent as fresh
meat to the sailors on board, and the othe**
two we eat ourselves. After our merry and
innocent feast was over, I began to distri-
bute my cargo among them. First I gave
them linen sufficient to make every one of
them four shirts. The thin English stuff I
allotted to make every one a light coat like
a frock, agreeable to the climate, and left
them such a quantity as to make up more
on their decay; as also pumps, shoes, hats,
and stockings. It is not to be expressed
the pleasing satisfaction which sat upon the
countenances of these poor men, when they
perceived what care I took of them, as if
I had been a common father to them all;
and they all engaged never to leave the is-
land till I gave my consent for their de-
parture. I then presented to them the peo-
ple I had brought, viz., the tailor, smith,
and the two carpenters. My tailor fell im-
mediately to work, and made every one of
them a shirt, after which, he learned the
women how to sew and stitch, thereby to
become more useful to their husbands.
Neither were the carpenters less valuable,
taking in pieces their clumsy things; instead
of which they made convenient and hand-
some tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards,
lockers, and shelves. To every man I gave
a spade, a shovel, and a rake; and to every
separate place a pickaxe, a crow, a broad
axe, and a saw, with a store for a general
supply, should any be broken or worn out.
I left them also nails, staples, hinges, ham-
mers, chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts
of tools and iron work; and for the use of
the smith, gave them three tons of unwrought
iron, for a supply; and as to arms and
ammunition, I stored them even to profu-
sion.
The young man (whose mother was un-
fortunately starved to death) together with
the maid, a pious and well-educated young
woman, seeing things so well ordered on
shore, and considering they had no occasion
to go so far a voyage as to the East In-
dies, both desired of me, that I would leave
them there, and enter them among my sub-
jects. This I readily agreed to, ordering
them a plot of ground, on which were three
little houses erected. So contrived were
their tents, that each of them had a room
apart to lodge in, while their middle tent
was not only their storehouse, but their
place for eating and drinking.
The affairs of the island being settled,
1 began to think seriously of taking my final
leave of its inhabitants, and returning to my
native country, leaving them in a flourishing
condition, with a promise to send further
relief from the Brazils, as sheep, hogs, and
cows; I went on board the ship again the
1st of May, 1695, after having been twenty
days among them; and next morning, giv-
ing them a salute of five guns at parting,
we set sail for the Brazils. The third day,
towards evening, there happening a calm,
and the current being very strong, we were
driven to the N. N. E. towards the land.
Some hours after we perceived the sea co-
vered as it were with something very black,
not easily at first to be discovered: upon
which our chief mate ascending the shrouds
a little way, and taking a view with the
perspective-glass, he cries out, " An army!
an army!" " You fool," said I, " what do
you mean?" "Nay sir," said he, "don't be
angry, I assure you it i? not only an army,
but a fleet too, for I believe there are a
thousand canoes paddling along, and making
with great haste towards us."
Indeed every one of us were surprised at
this relation; and my nephew, the captain,
could not tell us what to think of it, but
thought we should all be devoured. Nor
was I free from concern, when I considered
how much we were becalmed, and what a
strong current set towards the shore; how-
ever, I encouraged him not to be afraid, but
bring the ship to an anchor, as soon as
we were certain that we must engage them :
accordingly we did so, and furled all our
sails. As to the savages we feared nothing,
except that they might set the ship on fire;
to prevent which, I ordered them to get
their boats out, and fasten them, one close
by the head and another by the stern, well
manned, with sheets and buckets to extin-
guish the flames, should it so happen. The
savages soon came up with us; but there
was not so many as the mate had said, for
instead of a thousand canoes there were
only one hundred and twenty; too many
indeed for us, several of their canoes con-
taining about sixteen or seventeen men.
As they approached us, they seemed to
be in the greatest a7nazement, not knowing
what to make of ns. They rowed round
the ship, which occasioned us to call to the
men in the boats not to suffer them to come
near them. Hereupon they beckoned to
the savages to keep back, which th-ey accord-
ingly did; but at their retreat they let fly
about fifty arrows among us, and very much
wounded one of our men in the long-boat.
I called to them not to fire upon any ac-
count, but handing them down some deal
boards, the carpenters made them a kind
of fence to shield them from the arrows. In
half an hour after, they came so near astern
of us that we had a perfect sight of them ;
then they rowed a little further out, till
they came directly alongside of us and then
approached so near, that they could hear
us speak; this made me order all my men
to keep close, and get their guns ready. In
the mean time I ordered Friday to go out
upon deck, and ask them in his language
what they meant. He immediately cried
out thev were going to shoot; unfortunately
for him, poor creature, who fell under the
cloud of three hundred arrows, no less than
seven piercing through his body, killing- one
of the best servants, and most faithful of
companions in all my solitude and afflictions.
So enraged was I at the death of poor
Friday, that the guns, which before were
charged only with powder to frighten them,
1 ordered to be loaded with small shot; nor
did the gunners fail in their aim, but at
this broadside split and overset thirteen or
fourteen of their canoes, which killed num-
bers of them and set the rest swimming:
the others, frightened out of their wits, little
regarding their fellows drowning, scoured
away as fast as they could. One poor
wretch our people took up, swimming for
his life an hour after. He was very sullen
at first, so that he would neither eat nor
speak; but I took a way to cure him,
by ordering them to throw him into the
sea, which they did, and then he came
swimming back like a cork, calling in his
tongue, as I suppose, to save him. So we
took him on board, but was a long time
before we could make him speak or under-
stand English : yet when we had taught him,
he told us they were going with their kings
to fight a great battle; and when we asked
him what made them come up to us ? he
said, "To makee de great wonder look."
Here it is to be noted, that those natives
and those of Africa, always add two e's
at the end of English words, as makee, takee,
and the like, which it is a very difficult thing
to make them break off.
Being now under sail, we took our last
farewell of poor honest Friday, and interred
him with all possible decency and solemnity,
putting hiro in a coffin, and committing
him to the deep, at the same time causing
eleven guns to be fired over him. Thus
ended the life of one of the most grateful,
faithful, honest, and affectionate servants,
that ever any man was blessed with in the
world.
In our passage, we touched at the island
of Madagascar, where, though the inhabitants
are naturally fierce and treacherous, and so
constantly armed with bows and lances, yet
for a time they treated us civilly enough;
and in exhange for knives, scissors, and
other trifles, they brought us eleven good
fat bullocks, which we took partly for pre-
sent victuals, and the remainder to salt for
the ship's use. But in consequence of the
rude conduct of one of our sailors, this
friendly disposition was turned into malice
and revenge; the inhabitants attacked the
offending sailor, killed him, and hung him
on a tree as an example to the rest; which
so enraged bis companions, that they fell
upon them, burnt their dwellings, and
massacred them without regard to age or sex.
I was extremely angry with every one
of them, but particularly with the captain,
who instead of cooling the rage of his men,
had prompted them on to further mischief;
nor could he make me any other excuse,
but that he was a man, and could not
master his passions at the sight of one of
his men so cruelly murdered. As for the
rest, knowing they were not under my com-
mand, thev took no notice of my anger,
but rather boasted of their revenge. Ac-
cording to all their accounts, they killed or
destroyed about one hundred and fifty men,
women, and children, besides burning the
town to ashes. They took their companion,
Tom Jeffery, from the tree, covered him
with some of the ruins and so left him.
But however this action of our rnen might
seem to them justifiable, yet I always openly
condemned it with the appellation of the
Massacre of Madagascar.
While we were under sail, the boatswain
would often defend his bloody action, by
saving, that the Indians had broke the truce
the night before, by shooting one of our
men without just provocation; and what if
the poor fellow had conducted himself a
little improperly, he ought not to have
been murdered in so villainous a manner;
and that they had acted nothing but what
the divine laws commissioned to be done
to such homicides. However, I was in the
same mind as before, telling them that they
were murderers, and bid them depend upon
it God would blast their voyage, for such
an unparalleled piece of barbarity.
When we came to the Gulf of Persia, five
of our men who ventured on shore, were
either killed or made slaves by the Arabians,
the rest of them having scarce time to
escape to their boat. This made me up-
braid them afresh with the retribution of
Heaven for such actions; upon which the
boatswain very warmly asked me, " Whe-
ther those men on whom the tower of Si-
loam fell, were greater sinners than the rest
y 3
of the Galileans?" and, "besides, Sir," said
he, " none of these five men that are lost
were with us at the Massacre of Madagas-
car, as you call it, and therefore your
representations are very unjust, and your
application improper. Besides," added he,
"you are continually using the men very ill
upon this account, and, being but a passen-
ger yourself, we are not obliged to bear it;
nor can we tell what evil designs you may
have to bring us to judgment for it in
England; and, therefore, if you do not leave
this discourse, as also not concern yourself
with any of our affairs, I will leave the ship
and not sail among such dangerous com-
pany." All this I heard very patiently;
but, it being often repeated, I at length told
him, the concern I had on board was none
of his business; that I was a considerable
owner in the ship, and therefore had a right
to speak in common; and that I was in no
way accountable to him, nor any body else.
As no more passed for some time after, I
thought all had been over.
At this time we were in the road of
Bengal, where, going on shore with the
supercargo one day, in the evening, as I
was preparing to go on board, one of the
men came to me, and told me, I need not
trouble myself to come to the boat, for that
the cockswain and others had ordered him
not to carry me on board any more This
insolent message much surprised me, yet I#
gave him no answer to it, but went directlv
and acquainted the supercargo, entreating
him to go on board, and, by acquainting
the captain with it, to prevent the mutiny
which I perceived would happen. But be-
fore I had spoken this, the matter was
quickly effected on board; for no sooner
was he gone off in the boat, but the boat-
swain, gunner, carpenter, and all the inferior
officers, came to the quarter-deck, desiring
to speak with the captain; and there the
boatswain made a long harangue, exclaiming
against me, as before mentioned, that if I
had not gone on shore peaceably for my
own diversion, they by violence, would have
compelled me, for their own satisfaction;
and as that they had shipped with the captain,
so they would faithfully serve him; but, it
1 did not quit the ship, or the captain,
oblige me to it, they would leave the ship
immediately. Hereupon, turning his face
about by way of signal, they all cried out,
" One and all ! one and all !"
You may be sure, that though my nephew
was a man of great courage, yet he could not
but be surprised at their sudden and unex-
pected behaviour; and though he talked stoutly
to them, and afterwards expostulated with
them, that in common justice to me, who
was a considerable owner in the ship, they
could not turn me, as it were out of my
own house, which might bring their lives in
danger, should they ever be taken in Eng-
land; nay, though he invited the boatswain
on shore to accommodate matters with me,
yet all this signified nothing; they would
have nothing to do with me ; and they were
resolved to go on shore if I came on board.
"Well," said my nephew, "if you are so
resolved, permit me to talk with him, and
then I have done;" so he came to me,
giving me an account of their resolution,
how one and all designed to forsake the
ship when I came on board, for which he
was greatly concerned. "I am glad to see
you, nephew," said I, " and rejoice it is no
worse, since they have not rebelled against
you; I only desire you to send my ne-
cessary things on shore, with a sufficient
sum of money, and I will find my way to
England as well as I can." Though this
grieved my nephew to the heart, yet there
was no remedy but compliance. In short,
all my necessaries were sent to me, and so
this matter was over in a few hours.
I think I was now near a thousand leagues
further off England by sea, than at ray little
kingdom. My nephew left me two persons
to attend me ; one of them was his servant,
and the other clerk to the purser, who en-
gaged to be mine. I took lodgings in an
English woman's house. The handsome
entertainment I met with here, occasioned
me to stay nine months, considering what
course I should take. Some English goods
I had with me of great value, besides a
thousand pieces of eight. The goods I
soon disposed of to advantage, and bought
here several good diamonds, which I could
easily carry about with me. One morning
an English merchant, with whom I was very
intimate, came to me: " Countryman," said
he, "I have a project to communicate to you,
which I hope'will suit both to our advantage.
If you will put a thousand pounds to my
thousand pounds, we will hire a ship, you
shall be captain, I will be merchant; and
we will go a trading voyage to China; for
why should we lie still like drones, while the
whole world is in continual motion/'
This proposal was very agreeable to my
rambling genius; but it required some time
before we could get a vessel to our mind, and
sailors to man it; at length we bought a
ship, and got an English mate, boatswain,
and gunner, a Dutch carpenter, and three
Portuguese fore-mast men; and for want of
others made shift with Indian seamen. We
went up to Suskan, making a great voyage,
and after eight months' time I returned to
Bengal, very well satisfied with this adventure.
The next voyage my friend proposed to
me, was to go among the Spice Islands, and
bring home a cargo of cloves from the Ma-
nillas, islands belonging partly to Spain, but
where the Dutch trade very considerably.
We were not long in preparing for this
voyage, which we made no less successful
than the last, touching at Borneo, and se-
veral other places, which I do not perfectly
remember, and returned home in about five
months' time. We soon sold our spices,
which were chiefly cloves and some nut-
megs, to the Persian merchants, who earned
them away to the Gulph, and were loaded
with money.
After a very great variety of adventures,
which prolonged my journey to a year, five
months, and three days, I reached once more
my native land in safety, cured of my ram-
bling inclinations, and only desirous to end
my days in peace.

WORKS FOR THE YOUNG.
A BOY'S ADVENTURES IN THE WILDS OF
AUSTRALIA ; or, Herbert's Note Book. By William Howitt. With
Designs by Harvey. New and Cheaper Edition, price 2*. bds.; or 4s.
cloth gilt.
" It is really the next thing to a personal pilgrimage through the Golden Land. In vivid
portraiture of things as they are, it far excels every publication that has yet reached us from
Australia."—British Banner.
" All the boys in England, whether ' old boys ' or young ones, will rejoice In this fascinating
book, full of anecdote and wild adventure; sober as we are and little given to roam, it has
inspired us with a strong desire to take a journey in the Bush, if we could see the end of it.
The descriptions of the scenery, the tree?, and the animals, are extremely spirited and graphic,
—they have all the appearance of being written on the spot, and are redolent of the fresh open
air. We have very seldom read a book of travels that has charmed us so much, and we shall
consider that the young folks who find it hanging on the bough of their ' Christmas tree" are
extremely fortunate." —Athentntm.
"As might be expected, they will find not only interesting and amusing incidents and
descriptions, but a good deal of useful information on the subject of Australian life, among the
natives as well as among emigrants. There are several woodcuts illustrating some of the
most striking scenes, and the book will take a high rank among Christmas and New Year
presents."— knglish Churchman.
" This is a capital book, and will commend itself alike to young and old. It is full of
humour, adventure, excitement, and those incidents of peril and pleasure which seem in-
digenous to Australia. The gold-diggings, bush-rangers and bush-lires—floods, robbers, and
hunting 'scapes—all contribute their quota to this interesting book. It is emphatically a
boy's book, and will be a very acceptable Christmas-gift."— Church and State Gcusette.
" This book was written in the midst of the scenes it describes, and has the>eality and vivid-
ness of actual experience and adventure. In the form of a boy's journal, it pictures Australian
scenes, and records the incidents of travel in the bush. The natural history or the bush is very
instructively and amusingly woven into the story... Let us then commend it, to boys especially, as
decidedly first-rate—one of the best books ever furnished for theirgraiiQcation."— Noncot\tormist.
